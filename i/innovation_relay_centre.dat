The case environment consists of South-East Finland and North-West Russia which forms the St. Petersburg Corridor Region. The aim is to find further specifications for these mechanisms. In theory a framework was created for an innovation support platform. Based on this model was conducted a survey in the case environment. The respondent group included representatives from industries, research institutions and governmental parties. The innovation system was open towards new methods. The implementation method, however, was not commonly shared. Better collaboration between the actors is needed hereby to enhance communication to companies ’ course. To promote innovations, expanding a network such as <b>Innovation</b> <b>Relay</b> <b>Centre</b> to the Corridor region is suggested, and utilizing and applying its technology transfer –model and international network.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper {{presents}} an innovative model of knowledge transfer, drawing upon {{the nature of}} the knowledge creation process as well as the specific features of a communication act. Such a model {{is the result of the}} hybridization of economic literature regarding services and technology transfer with linguistic and semiotic theories. Six classes of functions were identified, which can be articulated in a recursive sequence of activities. The heuristic virtues of the model were tested by analyzing the case of the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Relay</b> <b>Centre</b> of Southern Italy. We focused our attention upon IRC activities in the Apulian region. This choice was due both, to the strong presence in the region of small and medium sized enterprises and to the social capital absence that is usually ascribed to local firms. The model has proved to be effective in explaining IRC activity. Moreover it has allowed for the identification strengths and weaknesses which could be useful for the elaboration of future innovation policies.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} (TT) brokers are a type {{of innovation}} intermediary that {{is regarded as a}} facilitator of the interaction between donor and recipient within an innovation process. Yet, little is known about how to analyse their performance and efficiency. This paper aims at modelling a proper production function for the TT brokers, providing insights on how to compare their performance and investigating the influence of external factors on their efficiency, in order to drawuseful managerial and policy implications. Data drawnfrom a survey conducted among the nodes belonging to the technology transfer network IRC (<b>Innovation</b> <b>Relay</b> <b>Centre)</b> have been utilised to investigate how endogenous and exogenous factors may affect brokers' efficiency. Results showed how brokers can pursue more productive and targeted strategy in order to increase their impact and improve their performance ("inter alia", by taking into account a "pull" approach to technology and the need of a long-lasting relationship with the clients, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular). At the policy level, interesting insights are drawn on how to tune existing innovation support initiatives and design new ones from scratch. JRC. DDG. J. 3 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|E

SUMMARY: The effects of chronic administration of efavirenz commonly used as part of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type- 1 therapy on the chromatophilic substance of the intracranial auditory <b>relay</b> <b>centre</b> namely the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body of adult wistar rats were carefully studied. The rats of both sexes (n= 20), with an average weight of 200 g were randomly assigned into treatment (n= 10) and control (n= 10) groups. The rats in the treatment group received 600 mg/ 70 kg body weight of efavirenz dissolved in distilled water daily for 30 days through the orogastric tube. The control group received equal volume of distilled water daily for 30 days through the same route. The rats were fed with growerÕs mash obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Ewu, Edo state, Nigeria and given water liberally. ˚The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation method on the thirty-first day of the experiment. The inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10 % formal saline for histological study. The histological findings indicated that the treated sections of the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body showed that the chromatophilics substances were less intensely stained as compared to the control. The parenchyme was vacuolated and with evidence of hypertrophy and more spaces between the axonal mesh around the sparsely distributed neurons as compared to the control group. The treated section of the inferior colliculus showed neurons with faintly stained chromatophilics substances in large, medium and small sized neurons while that of the media...|$|R

40|$|The {{thalamus}} {{is one of}} {{the structures}} that receives projections from multiple ascending pain pathways. The structure is not merely a <b>relay</b> <b>centre</b> but is involved in processing nociceptive information before transmitting the information to various parts of the cortex. The thalamic nuclei are involved in the sensory discriminative and affective motivational components of pain. Generally each group of nucleus has prominent functions in one component for example ventrobasal complex in sensory discriminative component and intralaminar nuclei in affective-motivational component. The thalamus is also part of a network that projects to the spinal cord dorsal horn and modulates ascending nociceptive information. In the animal models of neuropathic pain, changes in the biochemistry, gene expression, thalamic blood flow and response properties of thalamic neurons have been shown.

40|$|Limits of {{the system}} of maize {{collection}} developed by traders in West Cameroon plateau. In the Western high plateau region of Cameroon, maize is a cash crop but the farmers do not understand the marketing system giving way to middlemen traders to benefit from the disorganisation of the maize trade to exploit the relationship between the farme rs and the market. This paper seeks to know whether maize trade through middlemen can help peasant farmers to adequately fight against poverty. Findings show that in spite of adequate maize production the trade through middlemen presents limitations. The middlemen attend only the periodic markets and those one located in accessible places.

40|$|NiFe] hydrogenases are metalloenzymes {{that act}} as highly {{efficient}} molecular electrocatalysts for the interconversion of protons and molecular hydrogen. Unlike any other known molecular electrocatalyst, {{the members of a}} subgroup of respiratory membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases are able to maintain H 2 catalysis in the sustained presence of O 2. This O 2 -tolerance depends on the ability to respond to oxidative inactivation by O 2 by exclusively forming rapidly reactivated active site states, thus implying a catalytic cycle in which O 2 acts as a competing substrate to H 2. Using isotope ratio mass spectrometry it is proven that the O 2 -tolerant Escherichia coli Hydrogenase 1 responds to O 2 attack by acting as a four-electron oxidoreductase, catalysing the reaction 2 H 2 + O 2 &# 8594; 2 H 2 O, equivalent to hydrogen combustion. Special features of the enzyme’s electron relay system enable delivery of the required electrons. A small fraction of the H 2 O produced arises from side reactions proceeding via reactive oxygen species, an unavoidable consequence of the presence of low-potential <b>relay</b> <b>centres</b> that release electrons from H 2 oxidation. While the ability to fully reduce O 2 to harmless H 2 O at the active site to generate the rapidly reactivated state Ni-B, determines if a hydrogenase is O 2 -tolerant, the ratio of oxidative inactivation to reductive reactivation rates determines how tolerant the enzyme is. It is shown by protein film electrochemistry that the (&# 945;&# 946;) 2 dimeric assembly of Hyd- 1 {{plays an important role in}} O 2 -tolerance by aiding reactivation of one catalytic unit through electron transfer from the other. The teamwork between two redundant partners implicates a new role for dimerisation and represents a new example of cooperativity in biology. Finally, the non-natural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine was synthesised and incorporated into Hyd- 1, testing the possibility of introducing labels at specific sites.
