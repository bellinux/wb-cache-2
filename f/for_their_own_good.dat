He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as shock therapy or lobotomy appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run. He also considers the issue of competency hearings and the insanity defense when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.|$|E

5000|$|The {{complexity}} of the [...] "input-output table" [...] {{can also lead to}} rigidity. Decentralized global supply chains lead to many firms competing for the same inputs and producing the same outputs, but an individual firm does not know whether the other firms and industries will be affected the same way in a shock. Cutting prices in a situation would not necessarily create more demand for a firm's products; it may just lead to lower profits and bankruptcy. Firms face large information requirements in determining how to optimize their pricing. They not only have to know the demand <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> costs, they have to know the pricing factors <b>for</b> all <b>their</b> competitors and other firms in the vast market of inputs and outputs. Capital market imperfections lead to more real rigidities. Capital markets may have asymmetric information problems because borrowers are better aware of their situation than lenders. This can lead to firms seeking more external finance during downturns, which drives up the firm's cost and creates another rigidity. Imperfect information can also create rigidity in the consumer market. Consumers may see price as an indicator for quality. Firms may be reluctant to cut their prices if they fear that consumers might start to the product as [...] "cheap".|$|R

40|$|In May 1984, the Nahua, a Panoan {{speaking}} {{indigenous people}} living in a remote corner of the Peruvian Amazon, experienced their ‘first contact’ with Peruvian national society. 25 years later they appear to many observers to have ‘thrown away their culture’ {{under pressure from the}} outside world. This thesis argues instead that these changes were adopted by the Nahua <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> very <b>good</b> reasons and that these transformations reflect greater continuity with the past than first appears. The apparent lack of nostalgia that the Nahua have for the past instead reflects an inherent capacity for flexibility. This flexibility is manifested at a collective level in the frequent fissions of local groups and at an individual level in their susceptibility to losing their sense of self. The thesis focuses on two key aspects of this flexibility. The first is that the Nahua understand the site of their personal transformations to be the body which they describe as ‘soft’. This ‘softness’ refers to its ability to incorporate other worldly powers and become like the animals they eat or the people with whom they co-reside. Nevertheless, this capacity also means they can become ‘other’ when they live apart from their kin. This elasticity of selfhood is typical of many indigenous Amazonian peoples but the Nahua sit at the more flexible end of this spectrum. This is because they cultivate an attitude of radical hunger towards the outside world and place relatively less importance on techniques of restraint and control. The second aspect is the astonishing flexibility of Nahua worldviews. This is because their cosmologies are less a fixed set of facts and more a shamanic technique of knowing the unknown. These techniques help the Nahua understand the mysteries of the spirit world, their dreams and the world of Peruvians. In conclusion, it is the ‘softness’ of their bodies, the elasticity of their selves and the flexibility of their cosmologies that explain the extraordinary resilience of the Nahua in the face of dramatic transformations in the surrounding world...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three evolutionary models examining market behavior.;Profit maximization is the usual prerequisite for achievement of competition. However, {{for a long time}} it has been thought that this principle of profit maximization can be replaced by natural selection. In an evolutionary model of an industry, where firms 2 ̆ 7 outputs are chosen randomly, where entry occurs with no motivation and where exit occurs when a firm 2 ̆ 7 s wealth becomes negative, the first paper shows that the industry converges in probability to a perfectly competitive equilibrium as firms get infinitesimally small relative to the market, as the entry fixed costs get sufficiently small and as time gets sufficiently large.;The second paper shows that informational efficiency can be achieved in the long run when all speculators are irrational noise traders. Speculators are assumed to be unsophisticated and merely act upon their predetermined trading types (buyer, seller, or both), their predetermined fractions of wealth allocated <b>for</b> speculation and <b>their</b> inherent abilities to predict the spot price, reflected in their distributions of prediction errors with respect to the spot price. In a dynamic model of a futures market, speculators with a continuous spectrum of all possible predictive abilities are followed through time. With continuous entry of such speculators into the economy the market redistributes wealth among speculators. This paper shows that the futures price converges in probability to the spot price.;The third paper uses an evolutionary approach to explain the origin of money as a medium of exchange in a primitive economy, where agents specialize in production for the purpose of trading <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> consumption <b>goods.</b> Agents meet randomly in pairs and trade bilaterally. All agents are assumed to begin with arbitrary trading strategies. A general class of dynamics, which is consistent with Darwinian dynamics, is applied to the selection of strategies. This paper finds that which commodities serve as media of exchange depends on the relative intrinsic values among all commodities, the proportions of agents specializing in different production consumption activities and the agents 2 ̆ 7 initial trading strategies. In addition, this paper shows that this class of dynamics only selects for the locally optimal equilibrium and it does not necessarily select for a global optimum...|$|R

60|$|Neither is it {{necessary}} to the feeling which constitutes the binding force of the utilitarian morality on those who recognize it, to wait for those social influences which would make its obligation felt by mankind at large. In the comparatively early state of human advancement in which we now live, a person cannot indeed feel that entireness of sympathy with all others, which would make any real discordance {{in the general direction}} of their conduct in life impossible; but already a person in whom the social feeling is at all developed, cannot bring himself to think of the rest of his fellow creatures as struggling rivals with him for the means of happiness, whom he must desire to see defeated in their object in order that he may succeed in his. The deeply-rooted conception which every individual even now has of himself as a social being, tends to make him feel it one of his natural wants that there should be harmony between his feelings and aims and those of his fellow creatures. If differences of opinion and of mental culture make it impossible for him to share many of their actual feelings-perhaps make him denounce and defy those feelings-he still needs to be conscious that his real aim and theirs do not conflict; that he is not opposing himself to what they really wish <b>for,</b> namely, <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good,</b> but is, on the contrary, promoting it. This feeling in most individuals is much inferior in strength to their selfish feelings, and is often wanting altogether. But to those who have it, it possesses all the characters of a natural feeling. It does not present itself to their minds as a superstition of education, or a law despotically imposed by the power of society, but as an attribute which it would not be well for them to be without. This conviction is the ultimate sanction of the greatest-happiness morality. This it is which makes any mind, of well-developed feelings, work with, and not against, the outward motives to care for others, afforded by what I have called the external sanctions; and when those sanctions are wanting, or act in an opposite direction, constitutes in itself a powerful internal binding force, in proportion to the sensitiveness and thoughtfulness of the character; since few but those whose mind is a moral blank, could bear to lay out their course of life on the plan of paying no regard to others except so far as <b>their</b> <b>own</b> private interest compels.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the good}} society? At the moment this is a {{question}} that is being asked by political actors all over the political spectrum, and not only by social democracy. The very word ‘society’, at least in the UK, has become a rather troublesome one, as New Labour’s active state was transplanted by Cameron’s big society, made up as this was of social conservatism and rather disturbing continuations of New Labour policy — such as the behavioural Nudge Unit. The latter is charged with making people behave in ways deemed better <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> and society’s <b>good.</b> It is not only the paternalism and the social engineering latent in this conception that are troubling; troubling is also the way in which ‘good’ has come to be understood in its economic sense, as determined by socio-technical parameters of efficiency. Is this the enduring legacy of New Labour? The conservatives did not come up with this themselves; on the contrary, this is a notion of the good that social democracy has actively promoted, not only in its Fabian past, but specifically in the last decades, as the welfare state was reinvented from a moral and ethical argument to a form of socioeconomic investment. With such heavy legacies from past and recent history, it would seem that neither the element of ‘good’ nor that of ‘society’ is particularly useful in terms of rethinking social democracy and a possibly better world to live in. At least at the moment, both elements are tainted by political discourses emanating from a central field that seems to have become a kind of intellectual prison...|$|R
40|$|In {{the opening}} essay in Embracing Risk: The Changing Culture of Insurance and Responsibility, Jonathan Simon and I assert that western society {{is engaged in}} a {{transformation}} from a dominant paradigm of spreading risks to a paradigm that involves embracing risk. (Baker & Simon, eds. 2002) The core idea behind this trend is the recognition that too much protection against loss produces too much loss. Not all risks should be spread. <b>For</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> and society's <b>good,</b> individuals should embrace some risks. As we wrote: "As more of life is understood in terms of risk, taking risks is increasingly what one does with risk. " Embracing Risk closes with a wonderful essay by Francois Ewald that also posits a paradigm shift. (Ewald 2002) But this paradigm shift revolves around the precautionary principle, an evolving principle in international law that calls for hesitating in the face of uncertainty, avoiding risk "zero risk" rather than "embracing risk. " Ewald identifies popular support for this principle as among the most important reactions to the failure of the insurance state to protect citizens from risk, a charge that surely resonates in the wake of September 11 th. The concept of embracing risk resonates much less well with September 11 th. None of the victims made any relevant choices. No one, or at least no one we would want to emulate, is embracing terror risks. Precaution is the order of the day. Yet, I continue to see evidence of the embracing risk thesis at work, though September 11 th has made that claim a more measured one. My goal in this essay is to suggest how it might be that the insurance state spawned these two seemingly contradictory reactions, how those reactions are in fact less contradictory than they at first appear, and what the embracing risk thesis and the precautionary principle might portend for liability and insurance after September 11 th. I will conclude by suggesting that part of the answer to some looming 21 st century insurance problems is to resurrect two distinctly two 19 th century ideas: the assessment approach to insurance and the concept of insurance regulation as an antidote to destructive competition. ...|$|R
