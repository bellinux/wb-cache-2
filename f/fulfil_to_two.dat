40|$|AbstractThe {{paucity of}} dogs {{dedicated}} to animal-assisted therapy (AAT) for disabled people creates long waiting lists worldwide and compromises {{the health of}} the few certified animals by demanding too much work from them at times, thus jeopardizing their future as service dogs. In an attempt to obviate this situation, a mathematical model has been conceived to select animals endowed with a set of specific inborn skills from a population of sheltered dogs. The model is able to select dogs capable of creating a special bond with humans and able to work anywhere and with any human partner or team; it represents a rapid, inexpensive and coherent method and has been validated after 1 year of observation. The algorithm consists of three steps. Step A is a test assessing the aggressiveness and temperament of animals and selection occurs based on a binary criterion (yes or no). Step B is a test comprising three items and selects animals able to interact with humans; dogs have <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>two</b> conditions <b>to</b> pass on to Step C. Step C is a test evaluating the animal's ability to respond appropriately to easy commands (trainability) given by different partners; dogs have <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>two</b> interrelated conditions judged more flexibly than in test B. The aims of the Ethotest are: (a) to prevent aggressive animals from entering animal-assisted activity and/or Therapy programmes; (b) to select dogs with the right aptitude and especially to restrict selection to dogs that offer consistent responses; (c) to include both male and female purebreds or mix breeds older than 1 year of age; (d) to identify animals able to work with different partners. Moreover, the aim of this contribution is to share with the scientific community an easy method to select shelter dogs as safe companion animals...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>two</b> purposes: <b>to</b> gain deeper {{insights}} into what young children think about their teachers, and to examine the effectiveness of different methodologies which are designed to elicit information from school beginners. By employing a variety of qualitative techniques, the study focussed on the development of research methodologies specifically appropriate to this age group. Although {{the results of the study}} suggest that the children perceive teachers as performing the more obvious didactic and authoritarian roles, they also indicate an awareness of the managerial aspects of teaching. The data also suggested that the children placed greater emphasis on the teachers role as an entertainer than as a nurturer.

First, we show that in the multicast case, the QoS parameters may be separated into two classes, namely the parameters whose scope is the whole multicast connection and those whose scope is limited to each receiver separately. Then, after a brief presentation of the enhanced QoS defined in the OSI 95 transport service, we examine how the QoS negotiation schemes used in the peer-to-peer ISO and OSI 95 transport services can be extended to multicast connections. Finally, a practical issue about QoS negotiation for multicast connections is presented. 1.

A 3 D diachronic reconstruction was achieved for this site using a fully digital workflow. Stra- tigraphic and architectural data obtained from the fieldwork, or reconstructed afterwards, were integrated into GIS and modelling software to produce 3 D volumes. We could produce static high-resolution renderings, a 3 D printed scale model of the stratigraphy and buildings, as well as digital interactive media.

40|$|Innovative {{separation}} techniques like melt crystallization {{have the}} potential <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>two</b> important demands, namely: a significant reduction of energy consumption by the chemical industry, {{and the production of}} high quality products required by industry. Several industrial applications of melt crystallization have been realized but industry is still hesitating to fully commit its resources. One of the most important reasons is that the most promising application of melt crystallization, the suspension-based melt crystallization process, is still under development. For this reason this study had the objective to improve equipment design and to establish optimal process conditions for the separation of crystals from the melt, this being the essential step in crystallization from suspension. The ultimate aim {{of the study was to}} test a pilot-plant for the application of melt crystallization to an industrial problem. In this paper, background information on melt crystallization processes and possible solid-liquid separation techniques will be given.

40|$|Conventional seismic design {{philosophy}} {{is based on}} dissipative structural response, which implicitly accepts structural damage under the design earthquake load thus leading to significant economic losses. Different strategies can be employed {{in order to reduce}} damage to structures under moderate to strong earthquakes such as base isolation and various implementations of active and semi-active structural control. Other strategies rely on supplemental damping conferred to the structure through various devices. These solutions require specialized knowledge at the design stage and during erection, careful maintenance and high initial cost. Another option constitutes a conventional design with replaceable dissipative members, easy to substitute even after strong earthquake, and thus reducing the repair costs. A system with removable dissipative elements has <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>two</b> requirements <b>to</b> be efficient. Firstly, inelastic deformations should occur in removable elements only. Secondly, the damaged dissipative elements must be replaceable. Replacing the elements is more efficient if the structure does not have large permanent deformations. These two concepts were implemented in a dual structure, obtained by combining steel eccentrically braced frames (with removable bolted links) and moment resisting frames.
