5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers.

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. <b>Here,</b> <b>only</b> some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E

25|$|Matsumoto's {{original}} theorem is {{even more}} general: For any root system, it gives a presentation for the unstable K-theory. This presentation {{is different from the}} one given <b>here</b> <b>only</b> for symplectic root systems. For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the root system is exactly the stable K-group for GL(A). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the Chevalley group of universal type for a given root system. This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems A'n (n>1) and, in the limit, stable second K-groups.|$|E
25|$|Noam Chomsky's Principles and Parameters {{theory in}} the 1980s {{introduced}} {{the idea that a}} small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by X-bar theory, proposed by Jackendoff in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in one of two ways. A head-complement order is called a head-initial structure, while a complement-head order is called a head-final structure. These are special cases of Tesnière's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since <b>here</b> <b>only</b> complements are considered, whereas Tesnière considered all types of dependents.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that because}} of the second condition, power series are used <b>here</b> <b>only</b> to allow {{infinitely}} many terms of a fixed degree, rather than to sum terms of all possible degrees. Allowing this is necessary because an element that contains for instance a term X1 should also contain a term X'i for every i>1 in order to be symmetric. Unlike the whole power series ring, the subring R is graded by the total degree of monomials: due to condition2, every element of R is a finite sum of homogeneous elements of R (which are themselves infinite sums of terms of equal degree). For every k0, the element e'k'R is defined as the formal sum of all products of k distinct indeterminates, which is clearly homogeneous of degree k.|$|E
25|$|Muscle strength, {{and stamina}} for {{sustained}} physical effort, decline in function with age in humans and other species. Skeletal muscle is a tissue composed largely of multinucleated myofibers, elements {{that arise from}} the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts. Accumulation of DNA damage with age in mammalian muscle {{has been reported in}} at least 18 studies since 1971. We will mention <b>here</b> <b>only</b> two of the more recent studies in rodents plus one in humans. Hamilton et al. reported that the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG accumulates in heart and skeletal muscle (as well as in brain, kidney and liver) of both mouse and rat with age. In humans, increases in 8-OHdG with age were reported for skeletal muscle. Catalase is an enzyme that removes hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, and thus limits oxidative DNA damage. In mice, when catalase expression is increased specifically in mitochondria, oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) in skeletal muscle is decreased and lifespan is increased by about 20%. These findings suggest that mitochondria are a significant source of the oxidative damages contributing to aging.|$|E
