The <b>Green</b> <b>Investment</b> Scheme (GIS), a mechanism {{in the framework of}} International Emissions Trading (IET), is designed to achieve greater flexibility in reaching the targets of the Kyoto Protocol while preserving environmental integrity of IET. However, using the GIS is not required under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is no official definition of the term.|$|E
25|$|OECD {{countries}} with a deficit could meet their Kyoto commitments by buying allowances from transition {{countries with}} a surplus. Unless other commitments {{were made to}} reduce the total surplus in allowances, such trade would not actually result in emissions being reduced (see also the section below on the <b>Green</b> <b>Investment</b> Scheme).|$|E
25|$|Almost all European {{countries}} are {{on track to}} achieve their first-round Kyoto targets. Spain plans to meet its target by purchasing a large quantity of Kyoto units through the flexibility mechanisms. Australia, Canada (Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in 2012), and Italy are not on course to meet their first-round Kyoto targets. In order to meet their targets, these countries would need to purchase emissions credits from other Kyoto countries. As noted in the section on Intergovernmental Emissions Trading, purchasing surplus credits from the EIT countries would not actually result in total emissions being reduced. An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits {{or the use of}} the voluntary <b>Green</b> <b>Investment</b> Scheme.|$|E

This study measures the occupations that will gain from <b>green</b> <b>investments</b> and the solutions the green economy provides to failures in the employment structure.

40|$|Climate {{change will}} have a {{significant}} impact on modern society. The economic impacts from climate change require the involvement of both governments and companies. Green bonds have emerged as tool to earmark capital for <b>green</b> <b>investments,</b> but the question remains whether green bonds accelerate <b>green</b> <b>investments.</b> This study outlines the advantages and disadvantages of green bond issuances in order to identify why green bonds could result in accelerated <b>green</b> <b>investments.</b> The data is acquired through interviews with investors and issuers, a survey among European issuers as well as a case study at AkzoNobel. The study also asks the question how green bonds could reduce the environmental impacts from the chemical industry. The results indicate that there are significant benefits in terms of company reputation, access to capital and internal legitimacy linked to the issuance of a green bond. The case study also indicates that a green bond issuance can have implications on the internal hierarchy of decision making by the addition of an environmental dimension to evaluation of <b>investments.</b> A <b>green</b> bond may bridge the historic gap between financial and sustainability departments. The conclusion is that green bonds accelerate <b>green</b> <b>investments,</b> as <b>green</b> bonds provide issuers with access to capital, increased company reputation, increased internal legitimacy for sustainability issues and shift decision power within companies. The efficiency of green bonds could be enhanced by the development of industry specific criteria, to have an impact along the entire value-chain to ensure significant environmental benefits...|$|R

We rely on a rich firm-level dataset on Italian manufacturing. Our results show that firms with higher productivity, induced among other factors by <b>green</b> <b>investments</b> combining environmental and increased revenue objectives, achieve a higher export performance. In particular, GTIS-enhanced TFP affects the probability of exporting in foreign markets characterized by more stringent environmental regulation.
