5000|$|<b>Fluproquazone</b> (trade name Tormosyl, RF 46-790 [...] ) was a quinazolinone {{derivative}} with potent analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects {{discovered by}} Sandoz. [...] It was withdrawn during development due to liver toxicity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluproquazone</b> (100 mg td. s.) was {{compared}} in a double-blind cross-over trial with indomethacin (25 mg td. s.) and placebo. <b>Fluproquazone</b> and indomethacin were both superior to placebo. The active drugs were comparable in most measures of efficacy though significantly more patients preferred indomethacin to <b>fluproquazone.</b> Side-effects were few {{and did not}} lead to withdrawal of treatment <b>FLUPROQUAZONE</b> is a new anti-inflammatory drug. It is 4 -p-fluorophenyl-l-isopropyl- 7 -methylquinazolin- 2 (l//) -one, a fluorinated derivative of proquazone. Single doses of 50 â€” 200 mg {{have been found to be}} at least as effective as aspirin in relieving headache or dental pain (Von Graffenried and Muesch, 1979; Maeglin et al., 1979); in these studies, 100 mg of <b>fluproquazone</b> was superior to 50 mg but 200 mg was no better than 100 mg. All these doses were superior to placebo. We tested a regular dosage regime of 100 mg three times daily against indomethacin and placebo in osteoarthritis. METHODS The trial was carried out using a double-blind cross-over design comparing flupro-quazone, indomethacin and placebo. The order of treatment was randomized and balance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluproquazone,</b> a new analgesic, was {{compared}} to a dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride and paracetamol combination (Cosalgesic) in a single blind trial lasting for five days. The trial included cases of various soft-tissue lesions and osteoarthrosis. Treatment was given to 170 patients, 84 of whom received <b>fluproquazone</b> and 86 the combination analgesic. The patients themselves made daily records {{of the severity of}} pain on a 100 mm visual analogue scale and in both treatment groups there was highly significant relief of pain, but with no significant differences between them. However, the incidence of side-effects was significantly higher with dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride-paracetamol (30 %) than with <b>fluproquazone</b> (9 %). <b>FLUPROQUAZONE</b> is a quinazolinone derivative with potent analgesic and antipyretic effects and also anti-inflammatory action. It {{has been shown to be}} effective in a variety of animal species after both oral and parenteral administration, and has a duration of action of several hours. The compound is many times more potent than acetylsalicylic acid and clinically generally resembles ibuprofen and indoprofen in its pharmacological effects, but with the very important difference that, when given, to rats repeatedly over a period of days, it lacks significant ulcerogenic activity (1) ...|$|E
