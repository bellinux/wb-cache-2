5|$|Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1916, this time built entirely upon copra export. Much of the South islet was deforested {{to make way for}} coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it was down to only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Most of the Baroque palazzi {{continued}} in private ownership throughout the 19th century, {{as the old}} aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> There were a few exceptions {{and some of these}} retain the ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in the use for which they were designed.|$|E
5|$|The small landowner-cultivators {{formed the}} {{majority}} of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Carnivàle {{takes place in}} the mid-1930s during the worst of the Great Depression, a time of massive social and {{political}} upheaval. Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was on the rise, in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains suffered from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only ran <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death.|$|E
50|$|In Mali it was {{reported}} that many people ran <b>into</b> <b>debts</b> in order to join the Qnet network after they were made to believe that their life will change and they will become rich, but that never happened.

50|$|A further {{manifestation of}} devotion to Merapu and the {{ancestors}} {{is reflected in}} the continuing construction in parts of East Sumba of impressive stone burial monuments, vestiges of one of the last surviving megalithic cultures on the planet.

5|$|Bajar dengan Djiwa {{follows the}} {{interactions}} of several groups of people. Husband and wife Basuki (Zonder) and Suryati (Nji Soelastri) clash because of their different personalities: the former is a thinker concerned {{with the state of}} society, while the latter only thinks of herself. Meanwhile, Umar (Oedjang) and Supini (RS Fatimah) clash over Umar's wasteful nature; eventually, he sinks so far <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> that he must sell his daughter, Djuliah (Djoewariah), to a loan shark named Asnan (O.

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, {{and despite his}} continued slide <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> donated money and trophies for football competitions. He served as Geelong's vice-president from 1873 to 1876, {{and was one of}} three delegates appointed by the club after the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was dropped soon after for unknown reasons. During the 1878 VFA season, he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter. That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept a firm grip on Ludlow Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during {{the first part of the}} century, despite the {{surrounding}} town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

5|$|In 1613 James I {{returned}} the castle to Thomas Howard, the Earl of Suffolk, but the castle was now derelict and {{he chose to}} live at Audley End House instead. Thomas's son, Theophilus Howard, fell heavily <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and sold the castle, the estate and the former Great Park to Sir Robert Hitcham in 1635 for £14,000; as with several other established parks, such as Eye, Kelsale and Hundon, the Great Park was broken up turned into separate estates. Hitcham died the following year, leaving the castle and the manor to Pembroke College in Cambridge, {{with the proviso that}} the college destroy the internal castle buildings and construct a poorhouse on the site instead, operating {{under the terms of the}} recently passed Poor Law.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E

The cleanup and recovery took months, assisted by military personnel. During the aftermath, food shortages resulted in long lines for aid at Andersen Air Force Base. Due to Pamela {{as well as the}} occurrence of other disasters in 1976, the American Red Cross went <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> after providing about $10million in assistance to 16,000families.

5|$|Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A {{number of}} foreign players were signed, {{including}} Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and {{had to rely on}} a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> {{for the first time in}} its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Following his retirement, Killebrew was a {{television}} broadcaster for the Twins at WTCN TV from 1976 to 1978, the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982, the California Angels in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988. While with Oakland, {{he also served}} as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor. In the late 1980s, Killebrew had financial problems. In July 1988, his house went into foreclosure and, in 1989, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that he had fallen $700,000 <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> He also divorced his first wife of over 30 years, Elaine, who he had married in 1955. Soon after, Killebrew's health failed. In May 1990, he {{was rushed to the hospital}} with a collapsed lung and damaged esophagus. Together with a subsequent abscess and staph infection, Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died. He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery. By December 1990, his health was improved and he was remarried to Nita.|$|E

5000|$|In 1774, the Thomas family fell <b>into</b> <b>debts</b> {{and sold}} the estate to Peter Birt, a coal magnate of Yorkshire. Birt ordered the {{building}} of a new castle in 1776-77, under the design of architect Robert Adam, his only building in Wales. The Birts later passed the estate to the Jenner family in 1823/4, who were prominent in 19th century Glamorganshire, and give their name to a district of Barry today, Jenner Park. Robert Francis Jenner (1802-1860) was High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1827.|$|R

5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1982, Kassar {{announced}} that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were {{cut from a}} 50 percent increase over 1981, down to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent—from US$54 to US$35—resulting in the company losing US$1.3billion in market valuation. Kassar sold five thousand of his Warner shares a half-hour before the announcement. This prompted an investigation for insider trading against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atari attempted to regain their market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles. The games, however, did not reverse Atari's decline and they went further <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> In 1983, the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US$356million. Other companies—Activision, Bally Manufacturing, and Mattel—experienced similar results as the industry declined.|$|E
5000|$|Anson {{was also}} known for his {{excessive}} gambling and lavish entertaining at his Shugborough Hall seat. He also purchased the estate at nearby Ranton, Staffordshire, where he built Abbey House and developed the estate into a great sporting centre. However, his extravagant lifestyle and gambling put him and the family <b>into</b> <b>debts</b> of £600,000 and led to Anson's financial collapse in 1842. The entire contents of Shugborough Hall were sold off {{to pay for the}} debts. [...] Abbey House at Ranton burned down in 1942. The ivy-covered ruins can still be seen.|$|R
