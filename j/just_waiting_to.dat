500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Life Is People received an average score of 86, based on 21reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that [...] "Fay performs these songs {{as if they}} were living things, independent of his inner world. His reverence for them makes the listening experience one of great emotional depth. Life Is People brims with compassion, vulnerability, and tenderness. It is not a comeback record but a late continuation, a great work of art." [...] Drew Litowitz of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "little has changed. Fay's songs sound as if they've simply been hanging out in the ether for all these years, <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be put to tape...Life Is People makes a strong argument for why Fay deserves recognition, and not just by those in the know." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the album a [...] "belated triumph" [...] which [...] "unfolds with the assurance of an old master still burning with the desire to tell his tales", saying that it was [...] "so much stronger than the latter-day works of many of Fay's contemporaries." [...] Critic Tom Hughes of The Guardian was less complimentary, noting that the album was [...] "not without a few syrupy moments, {{and it would be a}} push to recommend it over the old records" [...] but concluded that [...] "there are some fine songs here." [...] Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, said that [...] "Fay has finally created the masterpiece that will secure his reputation" [...] and added that Life is People was [...] "truly, the album of a lifetime." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... The painting, by George C. Barker & Son, and the decorating by Hayman, of this city, {{have been}} a source of {{enormous}} outlay, but the result is an equivalent to the cost, for the passenger, on arriving at the Quarter Deck and proceeding to the Grand Saloon, must certainly imagine that he is in the halls of enchantment, only read of in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. In each panel of the quarter-deck is painted a piece of statuary, while every nook and corner is covered with paint of the most delicate hue and finished off with an abundance of gilt. The appearance of the main saloon is really charming. Here, there, and everywhere, are flowers and birds, the one, in some cases, just appearing to blossom and the other, apparently, <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> spring from a branch, whereon it is perched, so naturally is everything done. In the main saloon, ladies' saloon, and social hall, may be seen very delightful specimens of good taste in the selection of the new velvet carpets, rugs, mats, silk curtains, lace curtains, etc., all of which are of the very costliest kind. The whole of the furniture in the grand saloon and ladies' saloon is covered in plum colored velvet, while that of the social hall is done in velvet and rep, each having a very beautiful effect on the surroundings ...|$|E
