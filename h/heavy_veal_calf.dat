40|$|In 2011, Dutch animal {{production}} sectors started recording veterinary antimicrobial consumption. These data {{are used by}} the Netherlands Veterinary Medicines Authority to create transparency in and define benchmark indicators for veterinary consumption of antimicrobials. This paper {{presents the results of}} sector wide consumption of antimicrobials, in the form of prescriptions or deliveries, for all pig, <b>veal</b> <b>calf,</b> and broiler farms. Data were used to calculate animal defined daily dosages per year (ADDD/Y) per pig or <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farm. For broiler farms, number of animal treatment days per year was calculated. Furthermore, data were used to calculate the consumption of specific antimicrobial classes per administration route per pig or <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farm. The distribution of antimicrobial consumption per farm varied greatly within and between farm categories. All categories, except for rose ́ starter farms, showed a highly right skewed distribution with a long tail. Median ADDD/Y values varied from 1. 2 ADDD/Y for rose ́ finisher farms to 83. 2 ADDD/Y for rose ́ starter farms, with 28. 6 ADDD/Y for white <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farms. Median consumption in pig farms was 9. 3 ADDD/Y for production pig farms and 3. 0 ADDD/Y for slaughter pig farms. Median consumption in broiler farms was 20. 9 ATD/Y. Regarding specific antimicrobial classes, fluoroquinolones were mainly used on <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farms, but in low quantities: P 75 range was 0 – 0. 99 ADDD/Y, and 0 – 0. 04 ADDD/Y in pig farms. The P 75 range for 3 rd/ 4 th-generation cephalosporins was 0 – 0. 07 ADDD/Y for <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farms, and 0 – 0. 1 ADDD/Y for pig farms...|$|R

40|$|Following the January 2006 European ban of {{antibiotics}} used as growth promoters in the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> industry, new feed additives {{are needed in}} order to maintain animal health and growth performance. As an alternative to in vivo experiments in the testing of such additives, an in vitro system modeling the intestinal ecosystem of the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> was developed. Stabilization of the main cultured microbial groups and their metabolic activity were tracked in an in vitro continuous fermentor operated under anaerobiosis, at pH 6. 5, and at a temperature of 38. 5 °C and supplied with one of three different nutritive media (M 1, M 2, or M 3). These media mainly differed in their concentrations of simple and complex carbohydrates and in their lipid sources. In vitro microbial levels and fermentative metabolite concentrations were compared to in vivo data, and the biochemical composition of the nutritive media was compared to that of the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> intestinal content. All three nutritive media were able to stabilize anaerobic and facultative anaerobic microflora, lactate-utilizing bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci, and Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria at levels close to in vivo values. The microbiota was metabolically active, with high concentrations of lactate, ammonia, and short-chain fatty acids found in the fermentative medium. Comparison with in vivo data indicated that M 3 outperformed M 1 and M 2 in simulating the conditions encountered in the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> intestine.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} data on the prevalences and trends of zoonotic agents in farm animals in the Netherlands, a monitoring system based on statistical principles was implemented in April 1997. This report {{presents the results of}} the first year of monitoring. The monitoring was focused on the occurrence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 in broilers, laying hens (layers), veal calves and dairy cattle. In addition, broiler braces were examined for the presence of (thermophilic) Campylobacter spp. and a selection of braces from all farm animal categories were examined for the presence of verocytotoxin (VT) -producing E. coli (VTEC) of all serotypes. The prevalences of the zoonotic agents were estimated at brace level. Braces were sampled by randomly collecting fresh faecal droppings on the farms. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 22. 0 % of the broiler braces (n= 100), 15. 3 % of the layer braces (n= 163) and 1. 6 % of the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> herds (n= 192). S. Enteritidis was isolated from 5. 5 % of the layer braces. Salmonella spp. were not isolated from any of the dairy cattle herds (n= 136). The prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler braces (n= 84) was 29. 8 %. E. coli O 157 was isolated from 4. 4 % of the dairy cattle herds, from 1. 6 % of the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> herds (n= 191) and from one of the layer braces. E. coli O 157 was not isolated from any of the broiler braces.

40|$|Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in pigs and veal calves. The environment and air in pig and <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> barns is often contaminated with LA-MRSA, and {{can act as}} a transmission source for humans. This study explores exposure-response relationships between sequence type 398 (ST 398) MRSA air exposure level and nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working and/or living on farms. Samples and data were used from three longitudinal field studies in pig and <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farm populations. Samples consisted of nasal swabs from the human participants and electrostatic dust fall collectors capturing airborne settled dust in barns. In both multivariate and mutually adjusted analyses, a strong association was found between nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working in the barns for > 20 h per week and MRSA air levels. In people working in the barns < 20 h per week there was a strong association between nasal carriage and number of working hours. Exposure to ST 398 MRSA in barn air seems to be an important determinant for nasal carriage, especially in the highly exposed group of farmers, next to duration of contact with animals. Intervention measures should therefore probably also target reduction of ST 398 MRSA air levels. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an outline of}} the veal industry, its standing relative to other cattle farming enterprises, and its future prospects. In 2008 some 20 per cent of bovines slaughtered in the EU were for veal production and about one-third of them were dairy calves. France, the Netherlands and Italy were Europe’s leading producers. Veal consumption in the European Union has been in steady decline since 1970. In 2008, it averaged 1. 6 kg per capita, with France and Italy being the largest consumers. Despite variations in farming systems and carcass characteristics {{from one country to}} another, veal production is an important outlet for milk replacer producers and provides a market for their industrial dairy products. Regular changes in production factors such as the price of 8 -day-old calves and milk replacers and their availability engender recurrent output fluctuations. <b>Veal</b> <b>calf</b> production plays a major part in regulating the milk and bovine-meat markets: it has largely contributed to stemming dairy (and sometimes meat) surpluses. However, the context has changed since 2008 with no more surplus milk supply and reduced EU-support for incorporating skimmed milk powder into milk feeds. Therefore, the relative attractiveness of other productions using 8 -day-old calves and the support policies for cattle farming as a whole will affect the future of the <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) {{emergence}} is a {{major public}} health concern. This study was aimed at assessing risk factors for persistently carrying MRSA in <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farmers and their family members. We also evaluate the dynamics of MRSA environmental load during the veal-calf production cycle. Design: Observational, longitudinal, repeated crosssectional study. Setting: 52 <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farms in the Netherlands. Participants: From the end of 2010 {{to the end of}} 2011, a total of 211 farmers, family members and employees were included in the study. Primary outcome and secondary outcome measures: Nasal swabs were taken from participants on days 0, 4, 7 and week 12. A persistent MRSA carrier was defined as a person positive for MRSA on days 0, 4 and 7. Participants filled in an extensive questionnaire to identify potential risk factors and confounders. For estimation of MRSA prevalence in calves and environmental contamination, animal nasal swabs and Electrostatic Dust Collectors were taken on day 0 and week 12. Results: The presence of potential animal reservoirs (free-ranging farm cats and sheep) and the level of contact with veal calves was positively associated with persistent MRSA carriage. Interestingly, {{at the end of the}} study (week 12), there was a twofold rise in animal prevalence and a significantly higher MRSA environmental load in the stables was found on farms with MRSA carriers. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that environmental contamination with MRSA plays a role in the acquisition of MRSA in farmers and their household members and suggests that other animal species should also be targeted to implement effective control strategies...|$|R
40|$|The European Union 1997 Directive, stipulating that {{veal calves}} should be fed {{a minimum of}} 50 to 250 g of fibrous feed from 8 to 20 wk of age, is vague. A fibrous feed ration maximum of 250 g has been implicated in welfare issues, namely the {{occurrence}} of abnormal oral behaviors and poor gastrointestinal health. Past research suggests that this amount is insufficient to prevent the development of abnormal oral behaviors and enabling good rumen development. Different sources and particle sizes of roughage could lead to very different welfare outcomes. In a 3 × 2 × 2 factorial design, 240 group-housed calves (10 ± 1 d; 46. 1 ± 0. 1 kg) were fed different roughage sources (straw, maize silage, or maize cob silage; the latter 2 were dried and provided no extra moisture compared with straw) in 2 amounts (250 or 500 g of dry matter per day), and 2 particle sizes (chopped or ground). Roughage was supplemented to milk replacer (MR) from 2 wk after arrival. In addition, 60 calves were fed 1 of 3 additional control treatments: MR only (n = 20), MR plus an iron supplement (n = 20), or MR plus ad libitum hay (n = 20). Oral behaviors were recorded using instantaneous scan sampling at 2 -min intervals for 2 h in 3 periods per day, at 12 and 22 wk of age. Calves were slaughtered at 24 wk of age and rumen and abomasal health parameters were recorded. Limited provision of straw resulted in behavior comparable with that from unlimited provision of hay, with reduced tongue playing and oral manipulation of the environment, as well as increased chewing compared with diets with no roughage supplement. Straw prevented ruminal hairballs, but impaired rumen development and increased abomasal damage. A higher ration of roughage increased chewing (12 wk), decreased oral manipulation of the trough (12 and 22 wk) and the pen (22 wk), and increased rumen weight. However, more roughage led to increased abomasal damage for certain parameters. Longer feed particles had no obvious benefits for behavior, but decreased hairball prevalence. Overall, unlimited hay had the highest benefit for both behavior and gastrointestinal health. Adding iron to the MR did not alter behavior or gastrointestinal health compared with MR without iron supplement. This study demonstrated that different roughage sources, amounts, and particle sizes have different effects on <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> behavior and gastrointestinal health, and hence on <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> welfare.

40|$|With the {{ultimate}} aim of containing {{the emergence of}} resistant bacteria, a Dutch policy was set in place in 2010 promoting a reduction of antimicrobial use (AMU) in food-producing animals. In this context, a study evaluated strategies to curb livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA). Fifty-one <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farms were {{assigned to one of}} 3 study arms: RAB farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol; RAB-CD farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol and applying a cleaning and disinfection program; and Control farms without interventions. MRSA carriage was tested in week 0 and week 12 of 2 consecutive production cycles in farmers, family members and veal calves. Interventions were validated and a cyclic rise in MRSA-prevalence in animals was shown with a more moderate increase in RAB farms. Prevalence in humans declined parallel over time in the study arms but RAB farms were at the lowest MRSA levels {{from the beginning of the}} study. In RAB-CD farms, human and animal prevalence did not differ from Control farms and MRSA air loads were significantly higher than in the other study arms. Mimicking the national trend, an overall AMU decrease (daily dosages per animal per cycle (DDDA/C)) was observed over 4 pre-study and the 2 study cycles; this trend did not have a significant effect on a set of evaluated farm technical parameters. AMU was positively associated with MRSA across study arms (ORs per 10 DDDA/C increase = 1. 26 for both humans (p = 0. 07) and animals (p = 0. 12 in first cycle)). These results suggest that AMU reduction might be a good strategy for curbing MRSA in <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> farming, however the specific cleaning and disinfecting program in RAB-CD farms was not effective. The drop in MRSA prevalence in people during the study could be attributed to the observed long-term AMU decreasing trend. </p...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{agents are}} used in cattle {{production}} systems for the prevention and control of bacterial associated diseases. A consequence of their use is the potential development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Australia is a major exporter of beef; however {{it does not have}} an ongoing surveillance system for AMR in cattle or foods derived from these animals. This study examined 910 beef cattle, 290 dairy cattle and 300 <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> faecal samples collected at slaughter for the presence of enterococci. Enterococcus were isolated from 805 (88. 5 %) beef cattle faeces, 244 (84. 1 %) dairy cattle faeces and 247 (82. 3 %) <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> faeces with a total of 800 enterococci subsequently selected for AMR testing. The results of AMR testing identified high levels of resistance to antimicrobials that are not critically or highly important to human medicine with resistance to flavomycin (80. 2 %) and lincomycin (85. 4 - 94. 2 %) routinely observed. Conversely, resistance to antibiotics considered critically or highly important to human medicine such as tigecycline, daptomycin, vancomycin and linezolid was not present in this study. There is minimal evidence that Australian cattle production practices are responsible for disproportionate contributions to AMR development and in general resistance to antimicrobials of critical and high importance in human medicine was low regardless of the isolate source. The low level of antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus from Australian cattle is likely to result from comprehensive controls around the use of antimicrobials in food-production animals in Australia.

Goal was to determine whether these compounds could interfere with histological screening for oestrogenic growth promoters. In a feeding experiment, four groups of veal calves fed plant-based protein-supplemented milk replacer (PBM), containing 5 % soy concentrate, 5 % soy isolate, 5 % wheat gluten and 2 % potato protein, for 4 weeks were compared to animals fed dairy-based control feed (DBM); animals treated with estradiol benzoate, diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol served as positive controls. Daidzein and genistein levels measured in feed and urine showed high levels of genistein and daidzein in the soy isolate and soy concentrate supplemented feeds. Genistein and daidzein were also found in the urine of the animals that were fed these feeds. Haematoxylin¿eosin-stained prostate sections of PBM-fed animals showed slight hyperplasia and some dilated tubules as compared to the DBM-fed group, but no metaplasia, which is used for screening for oestrogenic hormones. The positive controls showed extensive squamous metaplasia. Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 5 (using RCK 103 monoclonal antibody) in basal cells showed a normal staining pattern of basal cells in the DBM-fed calves and extensive basal cell proliferation and squamous metaplasia in the oestrogen-treated positive control animals.

As observed for other anaerobic species of the animal gut microbiota, C. difficile may be a reservoir of clinically important vancomycin resistance genes...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{detailed}} {{studies on}} antimicrobial resistance to commensal E. coli (in pigs, meat-producing bovines, broiler chickens and veal calves) and pathogenic E. coli (in pigs and bovines) in Belgium are presented for 2011. Broiler chicken and <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> isolates of commensal E. coli demonstrated higher antimicrobial resistance prevalence than isolates from pigs and bovines. Fifty percent of E. coli isolates from broiler chickens were resistant {{to at least}} five antimicrobials, whereas sixty-one percent of bovine E. coli isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. On the other hand, bovine pathogenic E. coli isolates showed an extended resistance profile {{with more than half}} of the isolates being resistant to ten or more antimicrobials. The results are not significantly different from the results from previously published studies on commensal bacteria in pigs in Belgium, although different methodologies of sampling and susceptibility testing were used...|$|R

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>veal</b> calves (4 - 6 mo old) often develop {{problems}} with insulin sensitivity. This {{could lead to}} metabolic disorders and impaired animal growth performance. Studies in various animal species {{have shown that the}} supplementation of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) can improve insulin sensitivity. We therefore studied the effects of scFOS supplementation on insulin sensitivity in <b>heavy</b> <b>veal</b> calves. Forty male Holstein-Friesian calves (BW = 190 ± 2. 9 kg; age = 162 ± 1. 4 d {{at the start of the}} trial) were fed either a control milk replacer (MR) diet or a diet in which one-third of the lactose was replaced by glucose, fructose, or glycerol for 10 wk prior to the start of the trial. At the start of the trial, calves were subjected to a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity (muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity). Calves within each dietary treatment group were ranked based on their insulin sensitivity value. Half of the calves received scFOS (12 mg/kg of BW) with the MR for 6 wk (supplementation was equally distributed over the insulin sensitivity range). Subsequently, a second frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted to assess the effect of scFOS. In addition, fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol were determined to calculate the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (fasting indicators of insulin sensitivity). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was low at the start of the trial and remained low in all groups [1. 0 ± 0. 1 and 0. 8 ± 0. 1 (mU/L) - 1 · min - 1 on average, respectively]. Supplementation of scFOS did not improve insulin sensitivity in any of the treatment groups. The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and the triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio also did not differ between scFOS and non-scFOS calves and averaged 0. 326 ± 0. 003 and 0. 088 ± 0. 004, respectively, at the end of the trial. We conclude that scFOS supplementation does not improve insulin sensitivity in <b>heavy</b> <b>veal</b> calves regardless of the carbohydrate composition of the MR. This is in contrast to other animals (e. g., dogs and horses), where scFOS supplementation did improve insulin sensitivity. The absence of an effect of scFOS might be related to the dosage or to metabolic differences between ruminants and nonruminants. Increasing evidence indicates that dietary interventions in veal calves have little or no effect on insulin sensitivity, possibly because of low levels of insulin sensitivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the risks}} {{associated}} with antimicrobial resistance and its link with antimicrobial use, available data on antimicrobial use in the Belgian pig, broiler and <b>veal</b> <b>calf</b> production were compared. Allowing for comparison of the data available from three peer-reviewed scientific articles, the unit of measurement for antimicrobial use was the Treatment Incidence (TI), defined as the number of animals per 1000 treated daily with one 'defined' (DDDA) or 'used daily dose animal' (UDDA). Moreover, extrapolation of farm-level data to national-level data was attempted according to the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) methodology, to estimate the amount of antimicrobials used in Belgium per species. Although, among the three species, the highest TI was observed in veal calves (TIDDDA= 414, TIUDDA= 379), based on the extrapolation, it was estimated that most antimicrobials were administered to pigs (159. 4 tons). Thus, the most rapid decline in the total use could potentially be achieved by targeting the pig sector. During the process of data collection for comparison and calculation, it became obvious {{that there is a need}} for harmonized monitoring programs...|$|R
