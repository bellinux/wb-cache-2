500|$|Due to {{the large}} {{quantities}} struck, Bicentennial coins remain inexpensive. [...] A set of three silver coins contains [...]5381 troy ounces of the precious metal. [...] In a 1996 statistical study, T.V. Buttrey found that about 750,000,000 of the circulation quarters, more than a third, had been hoarded and did not circulate. [...] Coin dealer Marcel Sassola suggested in 1977 of the silver sets, [...] "There were <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> sold, and I {{think it will take}} a long time before they have any real value.

5000|$|While Cal out {{gained the}} Wildcats in yardage 356 to 262, and though Longshore passed for 250 yards, his three interceptions turned quite costly, as {{did all of}} Cal's {{penalties}} on crucial plays. Despite their 17-3 mid-third quarter lead, the Bears <b>just</b> made <b>too</b> <b>many</b> mistakes. Hughes later reflected on the loss, [...] "The whole game was like plays going their way." ...|$|R
500|$|Although he commended West's {{vulnerability}} and signature sound, Rolling Stones Jon Caramanica felt that [...] "West isn't quite MC {{enough to hold}} down the entire disc". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani observed [...] "too many guest artists, too many interludes, and <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> songs period", but stated, [...] "As chest-beatingly self-congratulatory as it may be, The College Dropout is at once laugh-out-loud funny ('The New Workout Plan'), genuinely touching ('Family Business'), and brutally honest ('All Falls Down')". Pitchfork critic Rob Mitchum called it a [...] "flawed, overlong, hypocritical, egotistical, and altogether terrific album". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman felt that it shows West as a [...] "remarkably versatile lyricist and a valuable MC". Renee Graham of The Boston Globe asserted that [...] "West has certainly raised the bar on what mainstream hip-hop can and should be". In a retrospective review, Rolling Stone called it [...] "a demonstration that hip-hop—real, banging, commercial hip-hop—could be a vehicle for nuanced self-examination and musical subtlety." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, she {{divorced}} Steve Newkirk, {{whom she}} had married when she was 19, and the same year met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's first ship. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and {{they fell in love}} and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very different—Newkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, Animal Liberation (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just [...] "five people in a basement", as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who {{went on to become the}} national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Pacheco was reluctant at first. [...] "It just didn't sound great to me," [...] he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. [...] "I had been active in Europe ... and I thought there were <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> formalities. I thought we should just do things ourselves. But she made a convincing case that Washington needed a vehicle for animals because the current organizations were too conservative." ...|$|E
5000|$|Carla Day from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.0 (out of 5) {{and stated that}} [...] "The course of the NCIS {{investigation}} seemed off to me.

5000|$|... "Lifeline" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics. Chris Fallon of AbsolutePunk.net {{said about the}} single: <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> times the band takes one step forward and two steps back, at least showing some minimal signs {{of life in a}} dying genre built on repetition. Shaddix has a solid voice for this sound, and Horton seems to be discovering a new use for his distortion pedal, there are <b>just</b> far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> cliches in the ocean Papa Roach is trying to swim across, and the band can't seem to cope with their identity.|$|R
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E

5000|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly {{proclaimed that}} {{although}} [...] "Lucious {{was forced to}} be the single parent, he did it badly, wounding his three sons in myriad ways while he chased worldly significance."

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in technology, medication errors {{continue to take}} a toll on patients, families, and practitioners.

6000|$|Fourthly, That some effectual methods may {{be taken}} to civilize the poorer sort of our natives, in all those parts of this kingdom where the Irish abound; by {{introducing}} among them our language and customs; for want of which {{they live in the}} utmost ignorance, barbarity and poverty; giving themselves wholly up to idleness, nastiness, and thievery, to the very great and <b>just</b> reproach of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> landlords.
