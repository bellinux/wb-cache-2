5|$|On 9 July 1918 McCudden {{was killed}} in a flying {{accident}} when his aircraft crashed following an engine fault. His rank {{at the time of his}} death was major, a significant achievement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic. McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir-Wavans.|$|E

5|$|According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues {{called on}} Indians to honour Gandhi's memory {{and even more}} his ideals. Nehru used the {{assassination}} to consolidate {{the authority of the}} new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E
5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he would be more than happy to accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E

The decision to drop Ganguly resulted in widespread sympathy and praise <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been previously reviled by the Indian cricket following, resulting in further street protests in Calcutta. This included organised protests by organisations, politicians, including the blockading of rail transport in Bengal. Ganguly's cause was taken up by federal parliamentarians in the Lok Sabha.|$|E
25|$|Appropriately <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was {{associated}} all {{his adult life}} with a cavalry regiment, McCreery was a highly accomplished horseman. He twice won the Grand Military Gold Cup at Sandown Park Racecourse (in 1923 and 1928), and represented the Army at polo. In 1924 he {{and his younger brother}} Captain Selby McCreery constituted 50 percent of the Army polo team that played against the United States. In retirement during the 1950s, Dick McCreery took up polo again for a time, playing at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
25|$|It {{is notable}} {{that as the}} context in which the {{characters}} evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While he looked like a young man of about twenty years at the beginning of his adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.|$|E

5000|$|Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave it {{four stars}} out of five, saying that [...] "it's a move {{back away from}} the strident sound he's been forging lately" [...] and [...] "It's not a very {{original}} idea, but it's very well-executed". A less favorable review came from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who said [...] "the whole song is sweet and unoffensive, but it’s too familiar <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who’s</b> beginning <b>a</b> new chapter of his career".|$|R
25|$|Despite his well-groomed {{and dressed}} exterior, {{the man was}} in very poor health. The post mortem showed that he had {{advanced}} stages of prostate cancer and bone tumours. His heart showed signs of previous heart attacks and he possessed only one kidney, the other being removed. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had serious health conditions, the toxicology report stated {{that he had no}} medication of any sort in his system. The medical examiner stated that, due to his heart attacks and health status, the man would have been in significant pain and required prescription pain medicine or at least over-the-counter pain relievers to manage his pain.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Birkenshaw took 111 wickets – in the {{previous}} six seasons combined he had managed 102 in total – {{at an average of}} only 21.41. He took five in an innings on five occasions, including 7–86 against Sussex, and gained selection for the International XI that toured Pakistan in the winter. 1968 proved another good season for Birkenshaw, as he again took 100 wickets, and punished Sussex again: this time with the bat as he made 101 not out. He made two more centuries the following year, but surprisingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> passed fifty on 57 occasions in first-class cricket, he was to reach three figures just once more in his career. The years between 1969 and 1972 saw Birkenshaw record solid statistics, taking 69, 63, 89 and 90 wickets in successive seasons, and in 1972 he achieved his career-best bowling of 8–94 against Somerset.|$|E

500|$|According to Beckham, Homme by David Beckham is <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{opts for}} a [...] "cool, rugged look {{and one who}} prefers a clean-cut, sharp aesthetic." [...] The scent is said to [...] "encapsulate the spirit" [...] of Beckham, which, {{according}} to Rebecca Twomey of Digital Spy, is a concept [...] "sure to appeal as much to women as the men it is aimed at." [...] The fragrance {{is intended to be}} a more manly fragrance than Beckham's previous releases. According to Twomey, the fragrance's bottle is [...] "refreshingly different" [...] to Beckham's previous six scents.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Shankly's death, {{training}} was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield. The Labour Party conference stood in a minute's silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{had always been a}} socialist. Sir Matt Busby, the former Manchester United manager, was so upset that he refused to take any telephone calls from people asking him for a reaction. Tributes poured in from the world of football, especially from the former players of all Shankly's clubs. Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting: [...] "In my opinion, he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century".|$|E
500|$|Indigenous {{people in}} North and South America {{conceptualized}} a third gender for men-women and women-men. These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas, Timucuan in Florida, and Cueva in Panama. In Cree, the term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> took {{the role of}} a woman was ayekkwew; the Zuni word for a woman who took {{the role of a}} man was katsotse (boy-girl), and the Mohave give women the term hwame. The cross-gender roles have less to do with sexuality than with spirituality and occupation. A [...] "two-spirit" [...] woman who has a relationship with a non cross-gender woman is thought to be a [...] "hetero-gender" [...] relationship.|$|E

500|$|On Sunday 30 December, Trenchard {{arrived in}} St Moritz {{to begin his}} Swiss convalescence. [...] Boredom saw him take up bobsleighing as it did not require much use of his legs. [...] Initially he was prone to leave the run and {{end up in the}} snow, but after some days of {{practice}} he usually managed to stay on track. [...] It was during a heavy crash from the Cresta Run that his spine was somehow readjusted, enabling him to walk freely immediately after regaining consciousness. [...] Around a week later, Trenchard won the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club's Freshman and Novices' Cups for 1901; a remarkable triumph <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been unable to walk unaided only a few days before.|$|E
500|$|Novelist Salman Rushdie {{joined the}} band {{on stage in}} London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, despite the death fatwā against the author {{and the risk of}} {{violence}} arising from his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that [...] "real devils don't wear horns". In 2010, Clayton recalled that [...] "Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [...] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was supposed to be in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called The Holy Bible [...] "Richey James' last will and testament", concluding: [...] "Every song has a passage frightening in its imagery. Although the music itself isn't as scarily intense, its tight, terse hard rock and glam hooks accentuate the paranoia behind the songs, making the lyrics cut deeper." [...] Upon its re-release ten years later, Dan Martin of NME described The Holy Bible as [...] "a work of genuine genius". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "In a way, {{the story of}} Edwards' spiral into some unknown oblivion {{is tied to the}} experience of The Holy Bible, which in retrospect has become a sort of horror-show eulogy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> couldn't live with the world around him." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "even the pall of [...] absence can't cancel out the life-affirming force that hits you with the very first song".|$|E
