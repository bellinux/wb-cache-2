5|$|Throughout the mid-20th century, {{estimates}} of Pluto's mass were revised downward. In 1931, Nicholson and Mayall calculated its mass, {{based on its}} supposed effect on the giant planets, as roughly that of Earth; a value somewhat {{in accord with the}} 0.91 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass</b> calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. Wylie at the US Naval Observatory, using the same assumptions. In 1949, Gerard Kuiper's measurements of Pluto's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0.1 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass</b> disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original <b>Earth</b> <b>mass.</b> Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

50|$|Gas giants {{are split}} into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) {{according}} to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I.The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth, HD 85512 b (3.6 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses)</b> and OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb (5.5 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses),</b> or ice giants such as Uranus (14 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses)</b> and Neptune (17 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses).</b>|$|R
50|$|Solid planets up to {{thousands}} of <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> {{may be able to}} form around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5-120 solar masses), where the protoplanetary disk would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high UV radiation and winds that could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.For comparison, Neptune's <b>mass</b> equals 17 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses,</b> Jupiter has 318 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses,</b> and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU's working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass</b> planetesimal disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of trans-Neptunian rock–ice bodies of planetary size, ranging {{from less than}} an <b>Earth</b> <b>mass</b> up to a brown dwarf has been often postulated for different theoretical reasons to explain several observed or speculated features of the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. It was recently proposed to use ranging data from the New Horizons spacecraft to constrain the position of such a hypothesized body.|$|E
50|$|Two further super-Earths were {{discovered}} in 2006: OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb with a <b>mass</b> of 5.5 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses,</b> which was found by gravitational microlensing, and HD 69830 b with a <b>mass</b> of 10 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kepler-22b's radius {{is roughly}} {{twice that of}} <b>Earth.</b> Its <b>mass</b> and surface {{composition}} remain unknown, with only some very rough estimates established: it has fewer than 124 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> at the 3-sigma confidence limit, and fewer than 36 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> at 1-sigma confidence. The adopted model in Kipping et al. (2013) does not reliably detect the mass (the best fit value is only slightly larger than the 1-sigma error bar), though the mass is below 52.8 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> to 95% confidence.|$|R
50|$|Gas planets {{can also}} have large solid cores: the Saturn-mass planet HD 149026 b has only two-thirds of Saturn's radius, so it may have a rock-ice core of 60 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> or more. Corot-20b has 4.24 times Jupiter's mass but a radius of only 0.84 that of Jupiter—it may have a metal core of 800 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> if the heavy {{elements}} are concentrated in the core, or a core of 300 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> if the heavy elements are more distributed throughout the planet.|$|R

500|$|While [...] {{the astronomical}} {{community}} widely agrees that PlanetX, as originally envisioned, does not exist, {{the concept of}} an as-yet-unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System. [...] As of March 2014, observations with the WISE telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn-sized object (95 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass)</b> out to 10,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized (≈318 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass)</b> or larger object out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
500|$|Among known {{bodies of}} the Solar System, Eris is the ninth most massive {{directly}} orbiting the Sun, and the 16th most massive overall, because seven moons are more massive than all known dwarf planets. It is also the largest which {{has not yet been}} visited by a spacecraft. Eris was measured to be [...] in diameter. Eris' mass is about 0.27% of the <b>Earth</b> <b>mass,</b> about 27% more than dwarf planet Pluto, although Pluto is slightly larger by volume.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Dennis Rawlins conjectured, {{based on}} the {{similarities}} in the periodicity and amplitude of [...] brightness variation between Pluto and Neptune's moon Triton, that Pluto's mass must be similar to Triton's. This is, in fact, true, and had been argued by astronomers Walter Baade and E.C. Bower as early as 1934. However, because Triton's mass was then believed to be roughly 2.5% that of the Earth–Moon system (more than ten times its actual value), Rawlins's determination for Pluto's mass was similarly incorrect. It was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude that Pluto was not Planet X. In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii analysed spectra from Pluto's surface and determined that it must contain methane ice, which is highly reflective. This meant that Pluto, far from being dark, was in fact exceptionally bright, and thus was probably no more than 0.01 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Tethys is the 16th-largest {{moon in the}} Solar System, with a {{radius of}} 531km. Its mass is (0.000103 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass),</b> which is less than 1% of the Moon. [...] The density of Tethys is 0.98g/cm³, {{indicating}} that it is composed almost entirely of water-ice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, a {{possible}} Saturn-like (100 <b>Earth</b> <b>mass)</b> gas giant was announced orbiting the pulsar {{at a distance}} of about 40 AU. [...] The original hypothesis was retracted and a reinterpretation of the data led to a new hypothesis of a dwarf planet one-fifth the size of Pluto orbiting PSR B1257+12 at an average orbital distance of 2.4 AU with an orbital period of approximately 4.6 years. The dwarf planet hypothesis was also retracted because further observations showed that the pulsation anomalies previously thought to reveal a fourth orbital body are [...] "not periodic and can be fully explained in terms of slow changes in the pulsar’s dispersion measure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Habitability {{indicators}} and biosignatures {{must be interpreted}} within a planetary and environmental context. Whether a planet will emerge as habitable depends on {{the sequence of events}} that led to its formation, which could include the production of organic molecules in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, delivery of materials during and after planetary accretion, and the orbital location in the planetary system. [...] The chief assumption about habitable planets is that they are terrestrial. Such planets, roughly within one order of magnitude of <b>Earth</b> <b>mass,</b> are primarily composed of silicate rocks, and have not accreted the gaseous outer layers of hydrogen and helium found on gas giants. The possibility that life could evolve in the cloud tops of giant planets has not been decisively ruled out, though it is considered unlikely, as they have no surface and their gravity is enormous. The natural satellites of giant planets, meanwhile, remain valid candidates for hosting life.|$|E

50|$|Like COROT-7b, {{the mass}} of COROT-7c is weakly constrained, since the radial {{velocity}} data is noisy due {{to the presence of}} stellar activity. Published mass measurements range from 8.4 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> to 13.5 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses,</b> passing through 12.4 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses</b> and 13.1 <b>Earth</b> <b>masses.</b> This mass range encompasses the Super-Earths to Neptunes transition, so the nature of COROT-7c, either a rocky planet or an ice giant, remains unclear. However, if the larger mass estimates are correct, COROT-7c is probably a hot Uranus-like planet. Chances are high that planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, with one side of the planet always facing the star COROT-7 and the other one in permanent darkness. A possible third planet, COROT-7d, may be present in the system, but pending further observations its status remains unconfirmed. If this planet is confirmed, strong mutual gravitational forces could be exchanged between these planets, leading to powerful tidal forces.|$|R
