25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
500|$|Langton {{waited until}} 11:00pm {{to tell the}} others, which led to John Hawkins' {{becoming}} pale and overcome with [...] "an agony of mind", along with Seward and Hoole describing Johnson's death as [...] "the most awful sight". Boswell remarked, [...] "My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it. My imagination was not convinced." [...] William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated, [...] "He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing {{has a tendency to}} fill up. -Johnson is dead.- Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; -no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there {{he had his}} first work published, the {{critical}} essay [...] "Two Meredithian Heroes", which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone in the world. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it... It is extraordinarily touching.... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could..." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{after his}} {{appointment}} to the Supreme Court, Frankfurter remained close to the Roosevelt. In July 1943, on the behalf of the President, Frankfurter interviewed Jan Karski, {{a member of the}} Polish resistance who had been smuggled into the Warsaw ghetto and a camp near the Belzec death camp in 1942, in order to report back on what is now known as the Holocaust. Frankfurter greeted Karski's report with skepticism, later explaining: [...] "I did not say that he was lying, I said that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> him. There is a difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, then I saw the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. Then I saw the rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E

2500|$|The Waffen-SS did not {{probe the}} British Commonwealth front until the {{afternoon}} of 11 April. This included an encounter with Australian artillery positions on the main road; Captain Gordon Laybourne Smith of the 2/3rd Field Regiment later commented that the German commander had sent: [...] "In all his insolence ... trucks down the main road ... to within 3,000yards [...] of our infantry, and proceeded to debus [...] At first <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> it was an enemy, all had been so still and quiet. Then came some sense. My orders flew over the wire and the first rounds screamed through the air... A few furious moments and back went the Hun , but five trucks stayed in the road as silent witness that my troop could shoot". More prolonged skirmishes were directed at {{the positions of the}} 2/8th Battalion. These became more aggressive as night closed in. In the words of the Australian War Memorial: [...] "espite being strung out and exhausted from a long march to the position and bitterly cold weather, the 2/8th managed to fend them off." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able to see the light, but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I should lie down quietly in the grave, and that my body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E

60|$|Pushing {{open the}} {{swinging}} door I confronted {{a wall of}} smoke.
