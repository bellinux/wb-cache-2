5|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} division called {{for two of the}} airborne battalions to march through Oslo on 10 May, but the delay meant that only a few troops had arrived by this date. Instead, two platoons from 2nd Battalion The South Staffordshire Regiment and four Military Policemen on motorcycles accompanied Urquhart, who rode in a commandeered German staff car. The soldiers, although somewhat nervous given the small size of their group, were greeted enthusiastically by the Norwegian population in Oslo. The only resistance came from the captains of several U-boats at Trondheim. Apart from this, 1st Airborne Division encountered no trouble from the German forces in Norway, who co-operated fully with the airborne troops. They were disarmed without problem, allowed themselves to be transferred to collection camps and also assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of numerous minefields they had sown during their occupation, which resulted in several German casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1221 Maulay {{was accused}} of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The {{specific}} crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more {{to the fact that}} Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power. In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of Maulay from the charges of treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe. In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté, another of des Roches supporters. The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure, and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks. Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{received}} {{stocks of}} the new coins in advance and these were issued to retailers shortly before Decimalisation Day {{to enable them to}} give change immediately after the changeover. Banks were closed from 3:30 pm on Wednesday 10 February 1971 to 10:00 am on Monday 15 February, to enable all outstanding cheques and credits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> system to be processed and customers' account balances to be converted from £sd to decimal. In many banks the conversion was done manually, as most bank branches were not yet computerised. February had been chosen for Decimal Day because it was the quietest time of the year for the banks, shops, and transport organisations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhytoplankton and {{zooplankton}} were monitored during 2 {{years in}} four eutrophic shallow lakes (two turbid and two clear water) from two wetland reserves in Belgium.

25|$|In August 1943, the 2/4th was {{deployed}} to New Guinea, arriving at Milne Bay {{where they were}} placed {{under the command of}} the 9th Division, attached to the 26th Brigade. On 4 September, the 2/4th participated in Australia's first amphibious landing since Gallipoli when they landed at Lae during the Salamaua-Lae campaign. The 2/4th came ashore in the second wave of the landing, suffering heavy losses with thirty-four men being killed or missing when their Landing Ship Tank was attacked by Japanese dive and torpedo bombers. After the landing, the 2/4th began reconnaissance and flank protection operations for the 26th Brigade until 30 October, when Lae finally fell and they were sent by barge to reinforce the 20th Brigade at Finschhafen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of the Huon Peninsula. During this time the 2/4th conducted numerous long range patrols, often being sent ahead of the main advance, before finally being removed from the line at the end of February 1944 and being sent back to Australia for leave.|$|E
25|$|On January 4, 1945, Guards Colonel E.Ya. Birstein {{was given}} {{command of the}} division, which he would hold for the duration. At {{about the same time}} the 334th made its final transfer, to 2nd Guards Army in 3rd Belorussian Front, still in 60th Rifle Corps. Under these {{commands}} it took part in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. When the offensive was launched, 60th Rifle Corps was assigned to defend along a broad front to the north of Goldap while the remainder of 2nd Guards Army followed 28th Army's breakthrough of the German lines; the 334th and its Corps followed in second echelon. In the second half of March, in the lead-up to the assault on Königsberg, 60th Corps advanced along a route from Preussisch Eylau to Domnau, Tapiau, and Granz. During the assault, on April 7, the division assisted in forcing the Tierenberger River and reached the area north of Norgau. Once the city fell, the 334th took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of the Samland Peninsula beginning on April 13. In the course of these East Prussian operations it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, II Class, in March.|$|E

[...] He supplemented his legal work by acting as an agent for Boston-based merchant interests, including John Hancock, one of Boston's wealthiest men. [...] For his services as a lawyer defending land claims, in 1773 Sullivan was offered a tract within one of the claims he defended. He accepted, and the property was organized as Limerick Plantation, named after the birthplace of his father.

After Hardenburg Road, Shandelee Road begins to bend in {{different}} directions, {{several times to}} the west and several times to the east, intersecting with Meyer Road at a fork. CR149, which continues to the left at the fork, heads to the northwest, paralleling Meyer Road to the west. The residences begin to disappear and CR149 continues into a more wooded area, where it intersects with Whittendale Road, a local dead-end road. A short distance from Whittendale Road, CR149 makes a sharp bend to the northeast, intersecting with the northern termini of Stump Pond Road and Meyer Road. Near the intersection with Gilda Lane, CR149 passes the Sand Pond, and intersects with a series of short local roads. Paralleling the shores of Sand Pond for a short distance, Shandelee Road begins to enter the community of Shandelee. There, the highway intersects with Shandelee Lake Road, a short connector highway in the area. CR149 makes a curve to the east, following Shandelee Road for a distance, making several winds in direction until the alignment turns towards the northeast. Shandelee Road continues to the northeast, passing through local woodlands and fields. As CR149 nears Livingston Manor, the name changes from Shandelee Road to Main Street.|$|E

Thus a tax can be collected at the few places where all trades are ultimately cleared or settled.) ...|$|E
