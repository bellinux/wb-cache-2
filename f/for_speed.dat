5|$|USS Dictator was a single-turreted ironclad monitor, {{designed}} <b>for</b> <b>speed,</b> and to sail on {{the open}} sea. Originally to be named , the Navy Department preferred a more aggressive name, and thus she was named Dictator. She was the sister ship of USS Puritan. Despite her being designed <b>for</b> <b>speed,</b> design problems limited her {{to a maximum of}} 10 knots. She served in two different periods; from 1864 to 1865, serving with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and from 1869 to 1877, with the North Atlantic Fleet. After her final decommissioning in 1877, she was sold in 1883.|$|E

After the score was written, he created a demo of the entire score on a {{synthesizer}} to play for De Bont. While the score <b>for</b> <b>Speed</b> only used strings, French horns, and percussion, Speed2 used {{a wider variety of}} instruments including trombones, large woodwinds, bass clarinets, and contrabassoons. The score was recorded by a 96-person orchestra, including Mancina, who performed on a classical guitar on several cues. The reggae music featured a band with steel drums, in addition to Cuban drums and Latin percussion. De Bont wanted 16 steel drum players, but {{due to a lack of}} available players, Mancina used eight drums which were double-tracked.|$|E

5|$|The first {{speed skating}} {{competition}} {{took place on}} 24 January 1917, and the stadium remained in use <b>for</b> <b>speed</b> skating until 1929. AIF arranged their Norwegian championships in speed skating at Dælenenga in 1926 and 1929. Finland's Clas Thunberg set two unofficial world records in 1,000 meters of 1:31.60 twice in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality <b>for</b> <b>speed</b> and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need <b>for</b> <b>Speed</b> series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need <b>for</b> <b>Speed</b> game.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation <b>for</b> <b>speed.</b> The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed <b>for</b> <b>speed,</b> agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify <b>for</b> <b>speed</b> records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need <b>for</b> <b>speed</b> and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and {{were on their way}} south.|$|E
5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed <b>for</b> <b>speed</b> and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E

5|$|Some estates, {{especially}} in southern regions of Finland, {{were known to}} have used stallions of several light and hot-blooded breeds; for example, an officer in Pernaja bred Arabians. These crossbreeds were probably an attempt to create showy driving horses. A notable failing of a crossbreeding attempt happened in 1875, when a stud was founded in Porvoo to import and export Norfolk Trotters, a breed that has had important influence in several driving horse breeds, including the Standardbred. The crossbred offspring were praised for their looks, but {{turned out to have}} poor temperaments and no talent <b>for</b> <b>speed.</b> Due to a combination of the large population of horses in Finland (over 200000 animals) and the later enthusiasm for purebreeding, these estate-based crossbreeding attempts never had significant influence on the modern Finnish horse.|$|E
