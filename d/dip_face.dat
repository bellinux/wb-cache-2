40|$|Structural mapping and {{analysis}} of folds in Phanerozoic rocks in northern Arizona, using LANDSAT- 1 imagery, yielded information for a tectonic model useful in identifying regional fracture zones within the Colorado Plateau tectonic province. Since the monoclines within the province developed {{as a response to}} differential movements of basement blocks along high-angle faults, the monoclinal fold pattern records the position and trend of many elements of the regional fracture system. The Plateau is divided into a mosaic of complex, polyhedral crustal blocks whose steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>faces</b> correspond to major fracture zones. Zones of convergence and changes in the trend of the monoclinal traces reveal the corners of the blocks. Igneous (and salt) diapirs have been emplaced into many of the designated zones of crustal weakness. As loci of major fracturing, folding, and probably facies changes, the fractures exert control on the entrapment of oil and gas...|$|R

30|$|Based on a {{conveying}} {{capacity of}} 3000 t/h and a chain speed of 1.77  m/s, and the installed power of 2000  kW, the theoretical power consumption utilization was analyzed under {{the conditions of}} face lengths of 300, 250 and 207  m respectively (the actual length at the No. 8105 face in Tashan coal mine). The calculation results showed that: when the face length is 300  m, and <b>face</b> <b>dip</b> is 0 °, the power utilization reaches up to 94.3  %, power margin is small, which is only used in a flat or downhill face. When the face length is 250  m (or the actual face length at No. 8105 face is 207  m), and the <b>face</b> <b>dip</b> is 0 °, the power utilization is 78.6  % and 65  %, respectively, showing a large margin.

This paper takes the long wall for large inclined angle fully mechanized {{face of coal}} mine as the project background. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are adopted to study the break mechanism of the rock layer in steeply dipping seam mining; Through the numerical simulation results shows that the basic features are obtained, which are the biggest stress coefficient, abutment pressure of plastic area, roof weighting step，and convergence between roof and floor in working face．Based on the pressure appearance of the steeply dipping seam mining, control technology is given for the working face support stability, the work equipment prevent tumble and glide，and adjacent rock {{in the period of}} pressure. The study has a practice meaning in reducing coal mining accidents and improving the safety in steeply dipping seam mining...|$|R

What an unspeakable luxury {{it was to}} slake that thirst with the pure and limpid ice-water of the glacier! Down the sides of every great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by their own attrition; better still, wherever a rock had lain, there was now a bowl-shaped hole, with smooth white sides and bottom of ice, and this bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the careless observer would not see it at all, but would think the bowl was empty. These fountains had such an alluring look that I often stretched myself out when I was not thirsty and <b>dipped</b> my <b>face</b> in and drank till my teeth ached.

30|$|The steep dipping seam {{refers to}} the coal seam with the dip angle of 35 °– 55 °. Since the dip angle of coal seam is {{relatively}} large, the working face is vulnerable to the instability such as the bottom heave, slippage, etc. The drawback would induce slanting, topple and fall, gliding of hydraulic supports, etc. In this respect, {{it is challenging to}} perform coupling stability control of hydraulic support and surrounding rock. The longwall mining system instability and coal gangue splashing menace the mining safety. The steep dipping seam mining has long been a challenge in global coal mining industry. In China, the steep dipping seam is evenly distributed in each major mining site. The reported reserves and production account for 10 %– 20 % of the total coal reserves and 5 %– 8 % of the total coal output in the country. In addition, more than 50 % of the steep dipping seam mines are high-quality coking coal and anthracite coal.

40|$|High strain zones, {{characterized}} by shear fabrics and mylonites, {{have been identified}} within lower amphibolite-grade, coarse granular metasandstones of the Glen Lethnot Grit Formation of the Southern Highland Group (Dalradian) along the Highland Border, south-west of Stonehaven. The rocks comprise part of a polydeformed, regionally metamorphosed, Neoproterozoic sequence, bounded to the north by the post-orogenic Mount Battock Granite (Late Caledonian) and to the south-east by the Highland Boundary Fault Zone. Early regional Dl and D 2 structures have been rotated by a major monoform, the Highland Border Downbend (D 4), to produce a steeply <b>dipping,</b> downward <b>facing</b> succession. The mylonitic metasandstones contain a variety of kinematic indicators, including asymmetrical pressure shadows, S-C fabrics, shear bands and an extensional crenulation cleavage, which yield a sense of shear of top-towards-the SE (present structural position). Regional syn- to post-D 2 metamorphism resulted {{in the development of}} prograde pelitic mineral assemblages which overgrow earlier Dl structures. Mylonitic fabrics within the high strain zones, developed during D 2, both deform and are also overgrown by syn- to post-kinematic biotite porphyroblasts. The high strain zones may represent part of a major ductile structure active during the Dalradian D 2 -D 3 tectonothermal event, which contributed to the development of strong metamorphic gradients and narrowing of mineral assemblage zones within the Highland Border...|$|R
40|$|The Cleveland tin-copper deposit {{lies within}} a {{sequence}} of mafic volcanics and clastic sediments with minor limestone, of probable Eocambrian-Early Cambrian age. The north-east trending sequence is near vertical to north-west <b>dipping,</b> and <b>faces</b> north-west. The probable shallow marine volcano-sedimentary succession consists of an older mafic volcanic sequence (the Deep Creek Volcanics) and a predominantly clastic sequence (the Crescent Spur Sandstone) which are separated by a transitional sequence of clastic sediments, mafic volcanics and limestone (the Hall Formation). The Deep Creek Volcanics is dominated by spilitic, tholeiitic basalt with intercalated and interbedded lapilli, litho-vitric and lithic tuff, argillite and volcaniclastic greywacke. The Hall Formation consists of interbedded argillite, limestone and turbiditic greywacke and minor chert, lithic and litho-vitric tuff and spilitic, tholeiitic basalt. It is conformably overlain by the Crescent Spur Sandstone which consists of turbiditic greywacke and interbedded mudstone with argillite, chert, volcaniclastic greywacke and minor spilitic basalt. High-titania, spilitic basalt in the Deep Creek Volcanics and the Hall Formation exhibits geochemical affinities to ocean floor basalt, and has whole rock δ 18 O compositions similar to marine, hydrothermally metamorphosed basaltic rock. The volcano-sedimentary sequence is cut by regionally concordant, tectonically emplaced, older(?) low-titania, mafic-ultramafic ophiolitic complexes (e. g. the Whyte River complex), and is intruded by pre-mineralisation, high-titania basalt-dolerite dykes which are probably associated with the Deep Creek volcanism...|$|R

50|$|The {{different}} types of ''''Chēng'''' are given below: ''''''a)'''''' Chēngpī - is a double-headed laced drum, made of a hollow or hollowed out trunk of Phàng (Gmelina arborea) or similar other wood. The drum has a bigger head (amahang) and a smaller base (aling) with a slight bulge in the middle which gives the drum a conical profile. It is covered and tuned by laces ‘joining the striking head to a ring around the much smaller head’. Chēng Kindar (stout bamboo stick, thicker at the head which slims towards the base) and Chēng Baiko/Beko (wooden chisel with broad head and sharply tapered base) are used to tune the drum. A cane stick carved at one end called Chēngbe is used to hit the face and the rear is stroked by left hand to produce at least 7 (seven) basic sounds, such as— krong, klur, kret, klek, (front face) and chong, cherok and <b>Dip</b> (rear <b>face).</b> There are various interesting legends {{of the origin of}} Chēngpī which is played by master drummer Duhúidì during funeral festivals called Chomangkan.
