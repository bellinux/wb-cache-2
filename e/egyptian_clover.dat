The {{ground on}} both sides of the way was sunken, the earth being {{disposed}} in heaps at the foot of the fences, an arrangement which facilitates irrigation, by giving a fall to the water, and in some cases affords a richer soil than the surface. This part of the Madinah plain, however, being higher than the rest, is less subject to the disease of salt and nitre. On the way here and there the earth crumbles and looks dark under the dew of morning; but nowhere has it broken out into that glittering efflorescence which denotes the last stage of the attack. The fields and gardens are divided into small oblongs, separated from one another by little ridges of mould which form diminutive water-courses. Of the cereals there are luxuriant maize, wheat, and barley, but the latter two are in small quantities. Here and there patches of [...] "Barsim," [...] or <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover,</b> glitter brightly in the sunbeams. The principal vegetables are Badanjan (Egg-plant), the Bamiyah (a kind of esculent hibiscus, called Bhendi in India), and Mulukhiyah (Corchoris olitorius), a mucilaginous spinage common throughout this part of the East. These three are eaten by citizens of every rank; they are, in fact, the potatoes and the greens of Arabia. I remarked also onions and leeks in fair quantities, a few beds of carrots and beans; some Fijl (radishes), Lift (turnips), gourds, cucumbers, and similar plants. Fruit trees abound. There are five descriptions of vines, the best of which is Al-Sharifi, a long white grape of a flavour somewhat resembling the produce of Tuscany.[FN#11] Next to it, and very similar, is Al-Birni. The Hijazi is a round fruit, sweet, but insipid, which is also the reproach of the Sawadi, or black grape. And lastly, the Raziki is a small white fruit, with a diminutive stone.

Nine lactating homo-parity Baladi goats (average BW 23. 8 ± 0. 4 kg) at 7 d postpartum {{were used in}} a triplicate 3 × 3 Latin square design with 30 d experimental periods. Goats were fed a basal diet containing 0 (Control), 0. 25 (SRS 25) and 0. 45 (SRS 45) (w/w, DM basis) of SRS. The Control diet was berseem clover and concentrate mixture (1 : 1 DM basis). The SRS 45 had lowered total feed intake and forages intake compared to Control. The SRS 25 and SRS 45 rations had the highest digestibilities of DM (p = 0. 0241) and hemicellulose (p = 0. 0021) compared to Control which had higher (p< 0. 01) digestibilities of OM (p = 0. 0002) and CP (p = 0. 0005) than SRS 25 and SRS 45. Ruminal pH and microbial protein synthesis were higher (p< 0. 0001) for SRS 25 and SRS 45 than Control, which also had the highest (p< 0. 0001) concentration of TVFA, total proteins, non-protein N, and ammonia-N. All values of serum constituents were within normal ranges. The Control ration had higher serum globulin (p = 0. 0148), creatinine (p = 0. 0150), glucose (p = 0. 0002) and cholesterol (p = 0. 0016). Both Control and SRS 25 groups had the highest (p< 0. 05) milk (p = 0. 0330) and energy corrected milk (p = 0. 0290) yields. Fat content was higher (p = 0. 0373) with SRS 45 and SRS 25 groups compared with Control.

In this study, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> and Sudan grass seedlings were grown in four cadmium (Cd) concentration levels (0. 0, 25, 50 and 100 µM) in MS media to analyze growth responses, Cd accumulation in the shoots and roots of plantlets, proline contents, chlorophylls content and MDA levels of both plantlets. As well as RAPD analysis and leaves ultrastructure were detected. ResultsThe results showed that there was a significant decrease in root and shoot lengths, Chl a, Chl b, total Chl and carotenoids contents for both <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> and Sudan grass. However, there was a significant increase in Cd accumulation, proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The genetic variation between <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> and Sudan grass were evaluated using random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) markers to establish specific DNA markers associated with Cd stress. The results of transimssion electron microscopy (TEM) showed a clear disorder in the Cd treated <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> and Sudan grass seedlings.

40|$|For over 7 centuries, {{production}} of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Egypt {{has benefited from}} rotation with <b>Egyptian</b> berseem <b>clover</b> (Trifolium alexandrinum). The nitrogen supplied by this rotation replaces 25 - 33 % of the recommended rate of fertilizer-N application for rice production. This benefit to the rice cannot be explained solely by an increased availability of fixed N through mineralization of N-rich clover crop residues. Since rice normally supports a diverse microbial community of internal root colonists, we have examined {{the possibility that the}} clover symbiont, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii colonizes rice roots endophytically in fields where these crops are rotated, and if so, whether this novel plant-microbe association benefits rice growth. MPN plant infection studies were performed on macerates of surface-sterilized rice roots inoculated on T. alexandrinum as the legume trap host. The results indicated that the root interior of rice grown in fields rotated with clover in the Nile Delta contained ~ 106 clover-nodulating rhizobial endophytes g- 1 fresh weight of root. Plant tests plus microscopical, cultural, biochemical, and molecular structure studies indicated that the numerically dominant isolates of clover-nodulating rice endophytes represent 3 - 4 authentic strains of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii that were Nod+ Fix+ on berseem clover. Pure cultures of selected strains were able to colonize the interior of rice roots grown under gnotobiotic conditions. These rice endophytes were reisolated from surface-sterilized roots and shown by molecular methods to be the same as the original inoculant strains, thus verifying Koch's postulates. Two endophytic strains of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii significantly increased shoot and root growth of rice in growth chamber experiments, and grain yield plus agronomic fertilizer N-use efficiency of Giza- 175 hybrid rice in a field inoculation experiment conducted in the Nile Delta. Thus, fields where rice has been grown in rotation with clover since antiquity contain Fix+ strains of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii that naturally colonize the rice root interior, and these true rhizobial endophytes have the potential to promote rice growth and productivity under laboratory and field conditions...|$|R

A split-plot design in four replications was used. This investigation aimed to study the effect of seeding rates and cutting schedules parameters on chemical dry matter analysis of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> variety Miskawi Giza 6. Crude protein and fiber, ash content, ether extract and nitrogen free-extract percentages in blades and stems and its yields/fed were significantly affected due to cuttings. Highest percentages of CP and ash in blades and stems were produced from the second cut. While highest percentages of CF and EE in blades and stems were produced from the third cut. The fifth cut achieved the highest percentages of NFE in both blades and stems. Moreover, highest crude protein and ash yields per feddan were produced at the second cut. The third cut produced highest averages of CF, EE and NFE yields per feddan. Seeding rates caused significant differences on Crude protein (CP), Crude fiber (CF), ash content, EE and NFE percentages in blades and stems and its yields/fed were significantly affected due to seeding rates. Highest percentages of CP and EE in stems were resulted from sown with 30 kg seed/fed. While, using 45 kg seed/fed was accompanied with the highest percentages of CF and ash content in both blades and stems as well as NFE % in blades only. Moreover, the highest yields of CP, CF, ash, EE and NFE yields per feddan were produced from the medium seeding rate of 30 kg seed/fed. Percentages of CP, CF, ash content, EE and NFE in blades and stems as well as CP, CF, ash content, EE and NFE yields/fed significantly responded {{as a result of}} cutting schedules under study. Highest CP % produced from cutting plants at 30 cm height and after 25 days intervals in both blades and stems, respectively.

The collected data of the first 3 - years crop rotation showed that: 1 -The available N&P residuals were significantly increased with increasing fertilizer rates while that of K was not affected. 2 -The residual N was increased under drainage water application by about 31 % over fresh water, which {{may be due to}} the leached NO 3 anions in drainage water, while the residuals P and K were not affected by water quality. 3 -The micronutrient residuals were decreased with increasing NP fertilizer levels. 4 -Drainage water application caused significant reduction in the residual Fe, whereas those of Mn and Zn were slightly increased with drainage water application. 5 -Crop rotation 2 (very wet) and 3 (dry) caused significant increase in Zn residual only by about 42 % and 31 % respectively, while Fe and Mn were not affected. 6 - Crop rotation 2 recorded also significant increase in organic matter content compared to rotations 1 (wet) and 3 (dry), which may be due to that winter crop was <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> during the 3 -years crop rotation.

40|$|Ten {{different}} rotation schemes including two-and three-year durations {{were investigated}} in Middle Egypt region (Sids Agricultural Research Station), {{during a period}} exten¬ding from 1979 to 1903. The study aimed at evaluating diffe¬rent cotton rotations in which the well-adapted crops of the region were involved {{to determine the best}} cropping patterns suited to the recent variables in agricultural production. These patterns were randomizely distributed in a complete block design with a plot size equal to 0. 25 feddan. The effect of the preceding winter crop in each rotation on the yield of cotton was studied. The obtained data showed that cotton gave better yield when it was prece¬ded by a forage legume (<b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover)</b> than when it was preceded by a legume for seed (broad beans) or onion. A substantial increment in cotton yield was observed- after each rotation course. Growing cotton subsequent to a three-year rotation produced better yield in comparison with a two-year rotation. The net revenue per feddan was estimated. The two-year rotations (patterns J and H) gave the highest net revenue, where clover (as a main crop) and broad beans represented the highest concentration of the income. The three-year rotation (pattern C) is considered a preferable pattern where the income is concentrated in clover, wheat, cotton and maize respectively.

40|$|From 1986 to 2007 Egypt's {{agricultural}} policy transitioned from a tightly controlled {{to a more}} liberalized regime. This study examines {{the impact of this}} change on the performance of the wheat (imported grain) and rice (exported grain) sectors. In terms of profitability, we found that the cost of production increased substantially in both grains, driven primarily by the rise in land rent and labor wage. But the wheat and rice sectors' profitability did not suffer significantly, as advances in new seed technologies and adoption of better farm practices including farm mechanization increased yield and compensated for the higher cost. Considering market efficiency, we found that over the study period the farmer's share of the consumer's expenditure dropped from 51 % to 37 % in the case of wheat, while it increased from 24 % to 26 % in the case of rice. The reverse happened for wholesale and retail margin share, where it increased for wheat and decreased for rice. It is likely that the discipline from foreign suppliers of imported wheat and foreign market opportunities for exported rice may explain the difference in the changes of the distribution of consumer expenditure. Finally, we found that area response elasticity decreased over time from 0. 58 to 0. 12 for rice and 0. 60 to 0. 38 for wheat. The lack of response in rice area despite rising prices is attributed to the land limit strictly imposed by the Government of Egypt because of water supply constraint considerations. On the other hand, the lack of response in wheat area despite rising wheat prices may be attributed to the rising competitiveness of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover,</b> which is a main feed ingredient for the growing livestock sector. agricultural liberalization, area response elasticity, market efficiency, profitability. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{response}} to mass and family selection methods for improving Fahl population of berseem.

Seeds of selected half-sib families and both modified mass selection cycles C 1 and C 2 along with the base population were evaluated for forage and seed yields in third season. Gains realized from C 1 and C 2 mass selection, respectively were 13. 6 and 8. 5 % for seed yield, 4. 9 and 14. 4 % for fresh forage yield, 5. 3 and 13. 2 % for dry forage yield and 9. 1 and 13. 2 % for 1000 -seed weight over the base population.

The effects of varying compaction and water availability levels {{on the growth}} of Berseem or <b>Egyptian</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium alexandrimum L.), water use efficiency and nutrient concentration were investigated under greenhouse conditions. Treatments consisted of three soil compaction levels (bulk density of 1. 2, 1. 4 and 1. 6 Mg m- 3), and four water availability treatments (40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % of soil field capacity) in a factorial combination. Soil compaction {{had a significant effect}} on water use efficiency with the highest (0. 32 g l- 1) at bulk density of 1. 4 Mg m- 3 and the lowest at the other bulk densities. Soil compaction had no significant effects on leaf area, shoot, root and total dry masses. Water stress resulted in lower leaf area (from 231 to 153 mm 2 pot- 1), and the stem lengths were 7. 6 cm and 4. 3 cm for 80 % and 60 % of field capacity, respectively. Likewise, the highest (0. 47 g pot- 1) and lowest (0. 33 g pot- 1) total dry masses were observed at 80 % and 60 % field capacities. Water use efficiencies were 0. 32 and 0. 20 g l- 1 for 100 % and 60 % field capacities, respectively. The accumulation of N, P and K per unit length of roots increased with soil compaction. As the water supply increased, the root and shoot dry weight and water use efficiency increased. Treatment of 100 % field capacity resulted in the highest accumulation of N, P and K. Results indicated that the treatment of 80 % field capacity and bulk density of 1. 4 Mg m- 3 provided the best conditions for clover performance, among the applied treatments.

The isolate E 109 was the most potent being 72. 5 Uml− 1 and 2. 5 for amylase activity and starch hydrolysis ratio (SHR), respectively, at 50 °C. The potent isolate E 109 was identified based on phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic positions based on 16 S rRNA gene analysis and base sequences (submitted to NCBI Gen Bank). 16 S rRNA gene analysis confirmed that this isolate belonged to the genus Bacillus and it was most closely related to B. amyloliquefaciens (95 % similarity). For the production of amylases, nine agro-industrial residues were added as carbon sources to the basal medium. The medium supplemented with potato starchy waste as the sole carbon source enhanced the enzyme activity more than soluble starch as control for α, β and γ amylases activity, as it increased by B. amyloliquefaciens about 1. 26 & 4 and 8 -fold, respectively after 48 h at 50 °C using rotary shaker at 150 rpm. B. amyloliquefaciens gave the maximum values of α, β and γ amylases activity on medium supplemented with 2 % potato starchy waste after 30, 30 & 36 h of fermentation periods at 50 °C using shake flasks technique as a batch culture.
