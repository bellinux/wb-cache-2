5|$|The {{appearances}} of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, {{and he continued}} by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper director for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France {{before coming to the}} United States. He ended up recalling a <b>former</b> <b>director,</b> William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, <b>former</b> <b>director</b> of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E

He refuses to give this location to Phil Coulson, the <b>former</b> <b>director</b> who had stepped down {{with the hope that}} a new powered director could help calm human-Inhuman relations. With Mace planning to announce S.H.I.E.L.D. to the world as a legitimate agency, he has had Coulson helping him with public relations. Mack asks Johnson to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, as she was an agent and friend of theirs before leaving to become Quake. She refuses, and instead joins with Reyes in a partnership—he believes Momentum and the ghosts are connected to him.|$|E
