40|$|SELF's {{debugging}} {{system provides}} complete source-level debugging (expected behavior) with globally optimized code. It shields the debugger from optimizations {{performed by the}} compiler by dynamically deoptimizing code on demand. Deoptimization only affects the procedure activations that are actively being debugged; all other code runs at full speed. Deoptimization requires the compiler to supply debugging information at discrete interrupt points; the compiler can still perform extensive optimizations between <b>interrupt</b> <b>points</b> without affecting debuggability. At the same time, the inability to <b>interrupt</b> between <b>interrupt</b> <b>points</b> is invisible to the user. Our debugging system also handles programming changes during debugging. Again, the system provides expected behavior: {{it is possible to}} change a running program and immediately observe the effects of the change. Dynamic deoptimization transforms old compiled code (which may contain inlined copies of the old version of the changed proce [...] ...|$|R

A COLINT command set up the <b>interrupt,</b> <b>pointing</b> to the beginning BASIC line number of the [...] "interrupt handler", which had to end in a RETURN statement (part of standard, unexpanded BASIC) in order to transfer control back to the interrupted, [...] "mainline" [...] part of the program.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a dependent thinning {{of a regular}} point process {{with the aim of}} obtaining aggregation on the large scale and regularity on the small scale in the resulting target point process of retained points. Various parametric models for the underlying processes are suggested and the properties of the target point process are studied. Simulation and inference procedures are discussed when a realization of the target point process is observed, depending on whether the thinned points are observed or not. The paper extends previous work by Dietrich Stoyan on <b>interrupted</b> <b>point</b> processes...|$|R

50|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to run Itanium McKinley chips with clock-level lock stepping, the Integrity NonStop machines instead use comparisons between chip states at longer time scales, at <b>interrupt</b> <b>points</b> and at various software sync <b>points</b> in between <b>interrupts.</b> The intermediate sync points are automatically triggered at every n'th taken branch instruction, and are also explicitly inserted into long loop bodies by all NonStop compilers. The machine design supports both dual and triple redundancy, with either two or three physical microprocessors per logical Itanium processor. The triple version is sold to customers needing the utmost reliability. This new checking approach is called NSAA, NonStop Advanced Architecture.|$|R
