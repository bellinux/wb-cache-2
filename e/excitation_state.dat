Figure 1 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle for vibronic transitions in a molecule with Morse-like potential energy functions in both the ground and excited electronic states. In the low temperature approximation, the molecule starts out in the v = 0 vibrational level of the ground electronic state and upon absorbing a photon of the necessary energy, makes a transition to the excited electronic state. The electron configuration of the new state {{may result in a}} shift of the equilibrium position of the nuclei constituting the molecule. In the figure this shift in nuclear coordinates between the ground and the first excited state is labeled as q 01. In the simplest case of a diatomic molecule the nuclear coordinates axis refers to the internuclear separation. The vibronic transition is indicated by a vertical arrow due to the assumption of constant nuclear coordinates during the transition. The probability that the molecule can end up in any particular vibrational level is proportional to the square of the (vertical) overlap of the vibrational wavefunctions of the original and final state (see Quantum mechanical formulation section below). In the electronic excited state molecules quickly relax to the lowest vibrational level of the lowest electronic <b>excitation</b> <b>state</b> (Kasha's rule), and from there can decay to the [...] electronic ground state via photon emission.

A quantum point contact allows for tunneling of fractional quasiparticles between opposite edge states, thus acting as a beam splitter {{in the framework of}} the electron quantum optics. Excitations are then studied through heat and mixed noise generated by the random partitioning at the barrier. It is shown that levitons, the single-particle excitations of a filled Fermi sea recently observed in experiments, represent the cleanest states for heat transport since excess heat and mixed shot noise both vanish only when Lorentzian voltage pulses carrying integer electric charge are applied to the conductor. This happens in the integer quantum Hall regime and for Laughlin fractional states as well, with no influence of fractional physics on the conditions for clean energy pulses. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of such excitations to the overlap of Lorentzian wave packets.

Moreover, 5 -HT switched the turn response to chemosensory stimulation from avoidance to orienting in many animals. In isolated CNSs, bath application of 5 -HT both stimulated activity in the feeding motor network and switched the fictive turn response to unilateral sensory nerve stimulation from avoidance to orienting.
