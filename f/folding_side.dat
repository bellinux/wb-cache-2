25|$|The Aura {{was a new}} styling {{direction}} for Saturn, with styling that resembled its cousin, the European Opel Vectra. All Aura models came standard with <b>folding</b> <b>side</b> mirrors and side marker lights, lending to its European stylings. The design of the Aura Special appearance pieces included an integrated radio antenna in the rear window, a chrome appearance package available on XR models, standard 17inch wheels with five-spoke wheel covers and P225/50R17 all-season tires on XE models, and standard 18inch machined aluminum 14-spoke wheels on the XR with high-performance Goodyear Eagle LS2 P225/50R18 T tires.|$|E
25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient on the latest RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power <b>folding</b> <b>side</b> view mirrors, and navigation system.

5000|$|The T360 was {{produced}} as a conventional {{rear wheel drive}} pickup truck, a flatbed (the T360F), flatbed with folding sides (the T360H), and as a covered van (the T360V). There was also {{a version of the}} T360 called the [...] "Snow Crawler", equipped with tracked propulsion units at the rear. Due to its expense, the Snow Crawler remained a rarity in spite of its usefulness in certain parts of northern Japan. The T500 came either with a conventional pickup body (T500), or with the <b>folding</b> <b>side</b> flatbed, this time with the [...] "F" [...] suffix; called the T500F.|$|E

5000|$|Rigid chain {{actuators}} {{were developed}} from “chain rammers” that used a single “ram chain” thrust from a magazine to load heavy-caliber ordnance into the breech of a cannon. Robert Matthews received a US patent for his “Mechanical Rammer” in 1901 which used a roller {{on the leading}} end of the chain to guide it and allow thrust without deflection. [...] Developed {{more than a century}} ago, his rammer still bears a strong resemblance to many modern rigid chain actuators. In 1908 Oscar Knoch was awarded a US patent for his “Chain Rammer for Guns”. [...] By orienting the <b>folding</b> <b>side</b> of the chain upward his ram chain acted as a self-supporting telescoping beam with negligible sag. Used in this manner the need for a separate guide was eliminated.|$|E

60|$|Clean straw {{had been}} littered, a foot deep, down {{each side of}} the room; and fifteen {{blankets}} were <b>folded,</b> <b>side</b> by side, along by each wall.

60|$|I {{have said}} that the window of Marie's bedroom was above the door. The {{curtains}} were closed, but the <b>folding</b> <b>sides</b> were thrown open, and a lamp burned in the room.

Had I been unaided, I should have done what I had planned. But even as in a superb effort I rose from the earth he butted me into the air. I shot through the curtains as if I had been fired from a gun, and I dropped upon my hands and knees in the centre of the room.|$|R
