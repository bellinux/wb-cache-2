40|$|In {{search of}} a {{macroeconomic}} theory of wage determination, the agnostic reader should be puzzled by the apparent contradiction between two influential theories. On one hand, in the standard search-matching theory with wage bargaining, <b>hiring</b> <b>cost</b> and constant returns of labor, the bargaining power of employees allows them to get rents and gives rise either to overemployment or to under-employment compared with the first-best. On the other hand, in Stole and Zwiebel?s theory of intrafirm bargaining with no <b>hiring</b> <b>cost</b> and decreasing returns of labor, the bargaining power of employees does {{not allow them to}} get rent and always gives rise to over-employment.

40|$|We analyze determinacy and {{stability}} under learning (E-stability) of rational expectations equilibria in the Blanchard and Gal (2006, 2008) New-Keynesian model of inflation and unemployment, where labor market frictions due to <b>costs</b> of <b>hiring</b> workers {{play an important}} role. We derive results for alternative specifications of monetary policy rules and alternative values of <b>hiring</b> <b>costs</b> {{as a percentage of}} GDP. Under low <b>hiring</b> <b>costs</b> - a typical part of the U. S. calibration - for policy rules based on current period inflation and unemployment our results {{are similar to those of}} Bullard and Mitra (2002). However, we find that the region of indeterminacy and E-instability in the policy space increases with the <b>hiring</b> <b>costs.</b> So, higher <b>hiring</b> <b>costs</b> - consistent with the European 'sclerotic' labor market institutions - seem to play an important part in explaining unemployment instability. Under lagged data based rules the area where monetary policy delivers both determinacy and E-stability shrinks. These rules perform worse according to these two dimensions when <b>hiring</b> <b>costs</b> go up. Finally, under expectations-based rules - unlike Bullard and Mitra (2002) - an additional explosive region is introduced. Here also the scope for determinacy and E-stability oriented monetary policy decreases. Interestingly - under the same rule and European 'sclerotic' labor market institutions we find that responding too much to expected inflation and too little to expected unemployment may very well be self-defeating. When <b>hiring</b> <b>costs</b> are large, a central bank that follows such a policy rule could very easily end up in the worst-case scenario of both indeterminacy and E-instability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this note}} is to derive, explore and discuss {{the shape of the}} {{recruitment}}, or <b>hiring</b> <b>cost</b> function.

The direct cost captures cost directly associated with recruitment, such as e. g. advertising, interviewing etc, while the indirect cost capture di¤erences in marginal productivity due to recruitment. By making assumptions about the learning process I am able to present a cost function for recruitment that is static and dependent on number of persons that are to be recruited. I will argue that the shape of the recruitment cost, i. e. convexity or concavity, depends on the type of job.

40|$|Crowdsourcing {{has become}} one of the most popular topics in both academia and {{industry}} in the past few years. By hiring workers online, task assigners can take advantage of the wisdom of the crowd and solve problems that used to only be solvable by experts or that are too hard for automated computer algorithms. Consensus tasks are some of the most common tasks in the crowdsourcing domain, e. g. labeling, classification, pattern recognition, and etc. To solve consensus tasks, a group of workers are hired to report possible outcomes, and their opinions are aggregated to produce a final prediction. When working with consensus tasks, crowd workers’ quality information is always valuable for system designers to find better workers and to devise opinion aggregation approaches that can produce predictions with higher accuracy. Traditional approaches used in many research literatures either assume every worker has a fixed quality, or the worker population as a whole has a fixed quality. They calculate worker quality from historical data, assume it stays as is and use it for estimating existing workers’ future performance and future workers’ starting performance. We argue this is not true, especially for more complicated tasks where workers may need time and experience to fathom the idea and become adequate. We think the learning curve model used in factories and plants to model traditional workers’ productivity and quality can be adopted to work in a crowdsourcing context, where workers quality should improve too as they work on more tasks and become experienced. We modified the hyperbolic learning curve and setup a sleep spindle detection experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to validate our argument. The results proved our hypothesis that crowd workers do achieve higher quality as they work on more tasks, and different workers have different quality and learning speed. Moreover, our linear regression test shows that hyperbolic learning curve is a good fit to model crowd workers’ learning process. This gives us a more accurate approach to estimate and project crowd workers’ quality. With the help of learning curve model, we design a new dynamic hiring system that can make smart tradeoffs between workers’ current quality and future potential, as well as the accuracy of aggregated prediction and <b>hiring</b> <b>cost.</b> It can take advantage of crowd workers’ quality improvement, find, train, stay with high potential workers, and reduce the number of hired workers when some of the top performers stand out. Our system models the hiring process as a Markov Decision Process, and uses Monte Carlo Planning to find the best hiring path which optimizes the utility of both prediction accuracy and worker training. We compared our proposed hiring mechanism against other common methods such as randomly selecting workers and a bandit based approach which lets all workers work on a small training set first and picks the best performing ones. From results in both sleep spindle detection tasks and simulated tasks, our proposed dynamic hiring system yields a competitive or better performance with significant saving in <b>hiring</b> <b>cost.</b> Moreover, to handle situations where crowd workers may not always be available and they are not free to hire to work on tutorial tasks, we extend our dynamic hiring mechanism to incorporate randomization so the system can choose between utilizing high quality workers and exploring unknown workers. From our simulation tests, the extended hiring system works as expected and can save even more in <b>hiring</b> <b>cost</b> while providing high quality predictions. Our dynamic hiring system especially outperforms traditional hiring approaches when the worker population is mixed where some workers have higher availability or learning speed. Overall, our dynamic hiring system is always able to find and take advantage of high potential workers and make hiring decisions adaptively. Our work opens up a new direction for hiring mechanism design in crowdsourcing settings where the usage of learning curves enable us to distinguish crowd workers and to model them more accurately...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of honesty norms {{in a society}} is studied. Our approach {{is based on the}} hypothesis that hiring or firing strategies chosen by firms may affect honesty: if it becomes common knowledge in the society that being honest is better for workers than cheating employers, then the share of opportunists gradually go down. It is shown that different hiring strategies are rational under different honesty standards. If honesty is not a prevailing social norm and volumes of appropriated rent may by high enough, then firms are better off to stimulate honest behavior by increasing wages. For a relatively honest society, firing cheaters is the best strategy. If honesty standards are intermediate or citizens are too impatient, ignorance of cheating may be rational. Therefore one observes three possible patterns of honesty evolution: honesty norms may either descend to critically low level or stabilize at some point or rise and fall cyclically. We prove that honesty standard rises as losses from dishonest behavior or <b>hiring</b> <b>cost</b> increase, honesty standard falls as rent appropriation opportunities expand or citizens get more impatient, and high expectations of economic growth promote honesty. ...|$|E
