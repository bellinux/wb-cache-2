5|$|Municipal – In the 2014 civic election, Richard Stewart {{was elected}} {{as mayor of}} Coquitlam, and Craig Hodge, Terry O'Neill, Brent Asmundson, Dennis Marsden, Mae Reid, Teri Towner, Bonita Zarrillo and Chris Wilson were all elected to Coquitlam City Council. Coquitlam {{contracts}} out <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> recycling services to International Paper Industries for city residents, but local businesses are {{responsible for their own}} <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> recycling arrangements. Coquitlam Lake provides residents with a mountain-fed water source, while the city maintains its own sewage management system.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{contracts}} {{out several}} services to private companies, including <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> recycling collection and street plowing and snow removal.

5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled <b>Garbage</b> <b>and</b> the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures {{and activities of}} this period. It quickly sold out its first print run, and a second was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.|$|E

While doing community service he visits Karen at Grace Adler Designs. While there, Jack goes through a trash bag and sees Soon-Yi Allen's phone bill. Jack shows Karen the bill which quickly results in the two prank calling Soon-Yi.|$|E
5|$|The Senne/Zenne (French/Dutch) was {{historically}} {{the main}} waterway of Brussels, {{but it became}} more polluted and less navigable as the city grew. By {{the second half of}} the 19th century, it had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
40|$|Through field {{research}} of typical villages and towns in China's northern cold region, this paper research energy consumption and resource {{recovery in the}} process of village <b>and</b> town <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal and organizes current situation and problems of village <b>and</b> town <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal. At present, village <b>and</b> town <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal means and thoughts are traditional and lag behind in China's northern cold region. There is the lack of <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal mode suitable for cold villages and towns. Thus, village and town resources are not effectively utilized, and residents’ living environment is affected continuously. This paper selects two mature garbage disposal methods: sanitary landfill and incineration power generation. Meanwhile, energy consumption and ultimate emission utilization of two schemes in <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal links are overall compared to propose <b>garbage</b> collection <b>and</b> disposal mode with low energy consumption suitable for green villages and towns in cold region. Besides, various control indexes of village <b>and</b> town <b>garbage</b> disposal schemes are explained in detail in combination of specific conditions...|$|R

5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests. Private residences were believed {{to have a high}} rate of voluntary cooperation with the city's plea to cut energy consumption.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata Municipal Corporation {{supplies}} {{the city with}} potable water that is sourced from the Hooghly River; {{most of it is}} treated and purified at the Palta pumping station located in North24 Parganas district. Roughly 95% of the 4,000tonnes of refuse produced daily by the city is transported to the dumping grounds in Dhapa, which is east of the town. To promote the recycling of <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> sewer water, agriculture in encouraged on the dumping grounds. Parts of the city lack proper sewerage, leading to unsanitary methods of waste disposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E

5|$|In the mid {{and late}} 1840s, {{immigrants}} from Ireland and Germany streamed into the city, swelling {{the population of}} Philadelphia and its suburbs. In Philadelphia, as the rich moved west of 7th Street, the poor moved into the upper class' former homes, which were converted into tenements and boarding houses. Many small row houses crowded alleyways and small streets, and these areas were filthy, filled with <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> the smell of manure from animal pens. During the 1840s and 1850s, hundreds died each year in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts from diseases such as malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cholera, related to poor sanitation and diseases brought by immigrants; the poor suffered the most fatalities. Small rowhouses and tenement housing were constructed south of South Street.|$|E
5|$|Mathews {{began her}} career in 1990 as an {{associate}} at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> {{the fate of the}} documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Pack-hunting of langurs is {{recorded}} in India. Packs of between 5 and 18 jackals scavenging on the carcasses of large ungulates {{is recorded}} in India and Israel. Packs of 8–12 jackals consisting {{of more than}} one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. In India, the Montagu's harrier and the Pallid harrier roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by scavenging on carrion and <b>garbage,</b> <b>and</b> will cache extra food by burying it. Golden jackals cause damage to melon, peanut, grape, coffee, maize, and sugarcane crops. They sometimes prey on lambs, weak sheep, kids, goats, and poultry. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, dhole, and gray wolf.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' <b>garbage</b> <b>and</b> tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E
