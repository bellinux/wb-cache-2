Singletary {{proved to be a}} fan favorite after a memorable post game interview.

Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.". The 49ers won their final game of the season, a 27-24 win at home over the Washington Redskins, to end their campaign with a final record of 7 wins and 9 losses. During the locker room announcement, Singletary stated that a four-year contract would be negotiated.

Actor and recovering cocaine addict Gary Busey entered the program, claiming to do so not as a patient, but as a mentor to assist others in their recoveries. This was stated in his contract, and confirmed by VH1's official press release about Season 2. Pinsky disputes this, however, stating, [...] "I was confused too. But that's not my problem.

5000|$|In the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback Nate Clements {{and safety}} Michael Lewis {{to improve their}} secondary. Clement's {{contract}} was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the NFL Draft, the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker Patrick Willis with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Before {{the beginning of the}} 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh died of complications from leukemia. The 49ers started the season 2-0, {{for the first time since}} 1998. In the fourth game of the season, against the Seattle Seahawks, Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back up quarterback Trent Dilfer's struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5-11 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator Mike Martz stated that a competition between Smith, Shaun Hill, and NFL journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2-5 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker with the Chicago Bears, was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post game interview. Singletary said of their loss: [...] "... right now, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth." [...] The team went 5-4 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7-9 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. Jed York is the oldest son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.|$|E

40|$|Carolyn Martin Shaw {{joined the}} UCSC faculty in 1972, {{hired by the}} {{anthropology}} department and Kresge College, where she served as provost from 1991 to 1996. In selecting Professor Martin Shaw in 2004 for the Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate, the Committee on Committees noted her “intelligent, imaginative, indefatigable, and principled work to create…communities of scholarship and learning characterized by openness, fairness, and respect. ” Martin Shaw’s abiding interest {{in the nature of}} human community and her dedicated efforts to help build robust communities at UCSC emerge as running themes throughout her oral history. UCSC in the early 1970 s presented her with other kinds of foreignness as well, in its whiteness and in the economic privilege enjoyed by many of its students. Landing in what was “really a world that I’m not familiar with,” Martin Shaw responded by rolling up her sleeves with curiosity, clear-sightedness, and a sense of civic responsibility: “Well, let me see what this world is like. …I’ve entered into a contract, and you’ve done so with me, and we’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a way to talk to each other. ” This attitude characterizes her discussion of many community-building challenges she engaged over the years at UCSC, in college, departmental, campus and system-wide contexts: identifying unrecognized power imbalances in Kresge’s purportedly liberating and egalitarian “touchy-feely” early culture (whose salubrious innovations she champions even as she critiques its problems); cultivating a supportive campus environment for students of color and other historically disenfranchised groups; navigating contentious periods {{in the evolution of the}} anthropology department and women’s studies program; developing sensitive and effective policies for addressing sexual harassment; obtaining faculty recognition for the dignity of staff labor and attention to the service of non-senate faculty; achieving senate support for a bold plan to revitalize the colleges as sites of academic endeavor; attempting to reduce the administration’s use of police force to quell student demonstrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{thing about}} empire {{building}} {{is that when}} you 2 ̆ 7 re done building one, you 2 ̆ 7 ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what to do with it. This generally involves the 2 ̆ 2 extraction of resources. 2 ̆ 2 We tend to think of this in terms of things like gold, oil, or rubber. But people can be 2 ̆ 2 extracted 2 ̆ 2 as well. The French empire of the later nineteenth century offers a case in point. Having found themselves in a very nasty war with the Germans, the French decided that it might be useful to enlist their African and Southeast Asian colonials in the fighting. As Richard Fogarty demonstrates in his excellent new book Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914 - 1918 (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008), this effort to draft the colonials led to no end of paradoxes. France was the home of Republicanism, and Republicans are supposed to be keen on liberteacute;, eacute;galiteacute;, fraterniteacute;. But the colonials weren 2 ̆ 7 t at liberty [...] they were subjects. Neither were they equal [...] they enjoyed few of the rights of the native French. And of course they weren 2 ̆ 7 t brothers [...] rather they were 2 ̆ 2 children 2 ̆ 2 of France. Yet the French felt free to ask their colonial underlings to undertake the highest act of civic sacrifice, namely, to fight and die for la Patrie. Would this sacrifice earn them liberteacute;, eacute;galiteacute;, fraterniteacute;? No. In fact, it didn 2 ̆ 7 t earn them much but a hellish trip to what looked like the end of the world. For, as Fogarty shows, French racism trumped French Republicanism throughout the war (and after, one might add). The colonial soldiers were segregated, stereotyped, and often used as cannon fodder. Some French felt bad about this. But most didn 2 ̆ 7 t. After all, the colonials needed to be 2 ̆ 2 civilized 2 ̆ 2 in order to enjoy the fruits of Republicanism, and presumably the French believed that asking them to die for their would-be motherland would help accomplish this feat. All it probably did was engender bitterness, as the French were to discover some decades later when their empire slipped away. digg_url = 2 ̆ 7 [URL]...|$|E
