40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to list the Characterization equipment drawings that are classified as Essential Drawings and Support Drawings. Essential Drawings: Are those drawings identified by the facility staff as necessary to directly support the safe operation of the facility or equipment (HNF 1997 a). Support Drawings: Are those drawings identified by facility staff that further describe the design details of structures, systems, or components shown on essential drawings. (HNF 1997 a) The Characterization equipment drawings identified in this report are deemed essential drawings as defined in HNF-PRO- 242, Engineering Drawing Requirements (HNF 1997 a). These drawings will be prepared, revised, and maintained per HNF-PRO- 440, Engineering <b>Document</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Control</b> (HNF 1997 b). All other Characterization equipment drawings not identified in this document will be considered General drawings until the Characterization Equipment Drawing Evaluation Report (Wilson 1998) is updated during fiscal year 1999. Trucks 1 and 2 drawings {{are not included in}} this revision of the essential drawing list due to uncertainty about future use...|$|E

This report establishes a common framework of terms and concepts which comprise an Open Archival Information System (OAIS).

40|$|This {{document}} is a technical Recommendation {{to use as}} the basis for providing audit and certification of the trustworthiness of digital repositories. It provides a detailed specification of criteria by which digital repositories shall be audited. The OAIS Reference Model contained a roadmap which included the need for a certification standard. The initial work was to be carried out outside CCSDS and then brought back into CCSDS to take into the standard. In 2003, Research Libraries Group (RLG) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) created a joint task force to specifically address digital repository certification. That task force published Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification: Criteria and Checklist (TRAC—reference [B 3]), on which this Recommended Practice is based.
