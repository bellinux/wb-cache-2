5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development <b>initiatives</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|E

After the event, Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16, 1945, in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings and pointed out that the large populations of developing countries would become {{a force to be reckoned}} with. Thurman, as a representative for the NCNW, {{attended the}} Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1947.

5|$|In {{the hours}} {{leading up to}} landfall, the TCWC in Brisbane issued 17 cyclone {{warnings}} for coastal areas. According to the BoM, residents received 20 hours of advance warning in which to complete preparations. By late on 23 December, police and ] workers were on alert for the approaching storm. High public preparedness and a relatively low loss of life were attributed to BoM cyclone awareness <b>initiatives</b> <b>in</b> the wake of 1970's deadly Cyclone Ada. However, storm victims still criticised the agency and local radio news stations for unclear, untimely, or conflicting broadcasts that caused widespread confusion.
