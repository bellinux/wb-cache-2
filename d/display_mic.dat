40|$|Abstract Background Amikacin inhale (BAY 41 - 6551), {{a unique}} drug 2 ̆ 014 device {{combination}} of a specially formulated drug solution and a pulmonary drug delivery system device (AMK-I) is currently under phase III study as an adjunctive therapy to IV antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} Gram-negative pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. While the epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia is predominated by Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus is increasingly recognized as a pathogen of concern for these pulmonary based infections. Since the aminoglycosides are historically quite active against S. aureus the use of adjunctive AMK-I may enhance bacterial eradication. Herein, we aimed to characterize the in vitro pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of human-simulated ELF exposures of AMK-I against both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) S. aureus. Methods An in vitro model was used to simulate the resultant ELF pharmacokinetic profile of amikacin after the administration of AMK-I 4000 mg q 12 h. The antibacterial activity of this regimen was tested against 7 S. aureus isolates that <b>display</b> <b>MIC</b> profiles encountered clinically (4 MRSA; MIC range 42 ̆ 01364, 3 MSSA; MIC range 82 ̆ 013160 mg/L). Experiments were conducted over 240 h and samples were taken throughout this period to assess the bacterial density in both control and treatments. Results The mean 010 SD inoculum 00 h bacterial density was 6. 40100. 09 which increased to 8. 60100. 19 log 10 CFU/mL in the control models by the end of 240 h experiments. Simulated ELF concentrations of AMK-I resulted in a rapid, 5 log 10 declined in CFU over the initial 120 h for all MRSA and MSSA isolates. After 120 h, all bacterial counts remained below the limit of detection (LOD, 1. 7 log 10 CFU/mL) and no regrowth was evident {{at the end of the}} study. Conclusion AMK-I produced an ELF exposure profile that was rapidly bactericidal against S. aureus displaying typical MICs to amikacin irrespective of their phenotypic profile to methicillin. While the Gram-negative organisms are the target pathogens for AMK-I in the ongoing clinical trials, these data suggest that this adjunctive regimen may also have the potential to eradicate both MSSA and MRSA from lower airway which needs to be further evaluated in randomized-controlled clinical trials...|$|E

Vancomycin, teicoplanin, and telavancin efficiently induced VanX activity in VanA-type strains, while VanX activity in VanB-type isolates was inducible by vancomycin but not by teicoplanin or telavancin. In VanA-type strains treated with vancomycin or telavancin, high levels of d-Ala-d-Lac-containing pentadepsipeptide were measured, while d-Ala-d-Ala pentapeptide was present at very low levels or not detected at all. In VanB-type strains, vancomycin but not telavancin induced high levels of pentadepsipeptide, while pentapeptide was not detected. Although vancomycin, teicoplanin, and telavancin induced similar levels of VanX activity in VanA-type strains, these organisms were more sensitive to telavancin, which <b>displayed</b> <b>MIC</b> values that were 32 - and 128 -fold lower than those of vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe crude {{extracts}} of Dietes bicolor leaves, {{flowers and}} rhizomes {{were subjected to}} comparative antimicrobial screening against two Gram-positive, two Gram-negative bacteria and four fungal strains using the agar well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the tested extracts were also determined. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity was evaluated. D. bicolor extracts generally demonstrated notable broad spectrum antimicrobial activities (MIC values≤ 500 μg/mL) against all tested pathogens. D. bicolor leaf extract showed potent broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging between 0. 24 and 31. 25 μg/mL against all tested pathogens. Moreover, the flowers extract exhibited promising antimicrobial activities, <b>displaying</b> <b>MIC</b> values ranging between 1. 95 and 125 μg/mL against the tested bacteria and fungi. However, the rhizomes extract showed moderate antimicrobial activity with MIC values ranging between 31. 25 and 500 μg/mL. Despite the potent antimicrobial activity of D. bicolor extracts, they were ineffective as cytotoxic agents against nine tested cancer cell lines, displaying 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values above 100 μg/mL. The reported potent antimicrobial activity along {{with the lack of}} measurable cytotoxic activity indicated that the antimicrobial activity of D. bicolor crude extracts is mediated through a mechanism other than cytotoxicity. These results suggest that D. bicolor can act as a potential source for natural antibacterial and antifungal agents with a good safety profile at a preliminary level...|$|R
40|$|Azithromycin {{is a major}} drug used in the {{treatment}} and prophylaxis of chlamydial infections. Spontaneous azithromycin-resistant mutants of Chlamydia psittaci 6 BC were isolated in vitro in the plaque assay at a frequency of about 10 − 8. Isogenic clonal variants with A 2058 C, A 2059 G, or A 2059 C mutations in the unique 23 S rRNA gene (Escherichia coli numbering system) <b>displayed</b> <b>MICs</b> for multiple macrolides (i. e., azithromycin, erythromycin, josamycin, and spiramycin) at least 100 times {{higher than those of}} the parent strain and were also more resistant to the lincosamide clindamycin. Chlamydia trachomatis L 2 variants with a Gln-to-Lys substitution in ribosomal protein L 4 at position 66 (E. coli numbering system), conferring an eightfold decrease in azithromycin and erythromycin sensitivities and a fourfold decrease in josamycin and spiramycin sensitivities, were isolated following serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations of azithromycin. Each mutation was stably maintained in the absence of selection but severely affected chlamydial infectivity, as determined by monitoring the development of each isolate over 46 h in the absence of selection, in pure culture or in 1 : 1 competition with the isogenic parent. Data in this study support the hypothesis that the mechanisms which confer high-level macrolide resistance in chlamydiae carry a prohibitive physiological cost and may thus limit the emergence of highly resistant clones of these important pathogens in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) {{species are}} {{opportunistic}} pathogens {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF), which are able to cause lethal infections. The Bcc are inherently resistant to most classes of antibiotics, which makes successful treatment problematic. Lipid A (also known as endotoxin), the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccaride (LPS), is the bio-active component of LPS. One of several unique characteristics of the lipid A of the Bcc, is the permanent attachment of 4 -amino- 4 -deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara 4 N) to the lipid A molecule. Also, the genes involved in L-Ara 4 N biosynthesis are necessary for viability in B. cenocepacia. Here we present research on lipid A biosynthesis, modi cation, and transport in the Bcc and highlight promising antimicrobial targets. The synthetic antibiotic CHIR- 090 is an inhibitor of LpxC, an enzyme involved in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway. I investigated the activity of CHIR- 090 against the Bcc and found that sensitivity to this antibiotic was both species- and strain-specific. CHIR- 090 <b>displayed</b> <b>MICs</b> between 0. 1 and 12. 5 μg/ml against a panel of B. multivorans, the most prevalent Burkholderia species in CF. The species- and strain-specific sensitivity towards CHIR- 090 was further explored and a strong correlation {{was found between the}} presence of a unique open reading frame, named LpxC 2, in resistant species. To address the problem of multiple drug-resistance of the Bcc, we investigated the activity of the pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP) -dependent enzyme inhibitor cycloserine (CS) against the Bcc. CS is used as a second line of defense against M. tuberculosis. The activity of the D-enantiomer of CS (DCS) against the Bcc was tested and <b>displayed</b> <b>MICs</b> between 2 and 128 μg/ml and acted bactericidal towards the Bcc. Additionally, DCS inhibition of recombinant ArnB from B. cenocepacia J 2315, a PLP-dependent enzyme necessary for viability in the Bcc, was studied. ArnB was inhibited reversibly by DCS. ArnB was further explored as a promising drug-target in the Bcc, but only CS has been identified as an inhibitor so far. In this thesis it was attempted to find the reason why is L-Ara 4 N modification of lipid A necessary for viability in B. cenocepacia. Therefore, two proteins were characterised, which are involved in lipid A transport: LptA, the periplasmic lipid A binding protein, and LptB, the cytoplasmic ATP-ase. LptA was found to be able to bind both modified and unmodified lipid A in vitro and therefore is not L-Ara 4 N specific. Furthermore, LptA could bind deep-rough-, rough-, and smooth- LPS, similar to that described for Escherichia coli LptA. The kinetic parameters of LptB were determined in vitro (kcat = 5. 71 min- 1 and KM = 0. 88 mM), and were comparable to E. coli LptB. The ATP-ase activity of LptB was not influenced by the presence of any forms of LPS (modified or non-modified). Therefore, we concluded that both B. cenocepacia J 2315 LptA and LptB are not L-Ara 4 N specific...|$|R

40|$|Antibacterial {{properties}} of the frog-derived peptide dermaseptin S 4 {{and a series of}} synthetic derivatives against the food pathogen Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 were investigated under extreme incubation conditions. The 28 -mer analog K 4 K 20 S 4 (P 28) <b>displayed</b> an <b>MIC</b> of 8 μM and rapid bactericidal kinetics under standard culture conditions. Potent bactericidal properties were maintained at high salt concentrations, under acidic or basic conditions, and at extreme temperatures. The N-terminal 14 -mer sequence (P 14) <b>displayed</b> higher potency (<b>MIC,</b> 4 μM) but only within a narrow range of incubation conditions, pointing to the importance of the C-terminal domain of P 28. The potency range was reextended upon conjugation of aminododecanoic acid to P 14. The resulting lipopeptide was even more potent (MIC, 2 μM) and affected bacterial viability under most of the conditions tested, including in commercial apple juice. The mechanistic implications of peptides' hydrophobicity, charge, structure, and binding to an idealized membrane were probed and are discussed here. Collectively, the data indicate interest in simple peptide-based compounds for design of antimicrobials that affect pathogens under a variable range of incubation conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{library of}} 66 cyclic decapeptides {{incorporating}} a Trp residue was synthesized on solid phase and screened against the phytopathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, and Erwinia amylovora. The hemolytic activity of these peptides was also evaluated. The results obtained {{were compared with}} those of a collection of Phe analogues previously reported. The analysis of the data showed that the presence of the Trp improved the antibacterial activity against these three pathogens. In particular, 40 to 46 Trp analogues displayed lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values than their corresponding Phe counterparts. Interestingly, 26 Trp-containing sequences exhibited MIC of 0. 8 to 3. 1 μM against X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, 21 peptides MIC of 1. 6 to 6. 2 μM against P. syringae pv. syringae and six peptides MIC of 6. 2 to 12. 5 μM against E. amylovora. Regarding the hemolysis, in general, Trp derivatives displayed a percentage of hemolysis comparable to that of their Phe analogues. Notably, 49 Trp-containing cyclic peptides showed a hemolysis ≤ 20 % at 125 μM. The peptides with the best biological activity profile were c(LKKKLWKKLQ) (BPC 086 W) and c(LKKKKWLLKQ) (BPC 108 W), which <b>displayed</b> <b>MIC</b> values ranging from 0. 8 to 12. 5 μM and a hemolysis ≤ 8 % at 125 μM.
