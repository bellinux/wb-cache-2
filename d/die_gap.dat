5000|$|In [...] Extrusion Blow Molding (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> with a parison programming device.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present a new numerical strategy using soft-computing techniques to determine the optimal <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> programming of extrusion blow molding processes. In this study, the design objective is to target a uniform part thickness after parison inflation by manipulating the parison <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> openings over time. To model the whole process, that is, the parison extrusion, the mould clamping and the parison inflation, commercial finite element software (BlowSim) from the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada is used. However, the use of such software is time-consuming and one important issue in a design environment is to minimize the number of simulations to get the optimal operating conditions. To do so, we proposed a new strategy called fuzzy neural 2 ̆ 013 Taguchi network with genetic algorithm (FUNTGA) that establishes a back propagation network using a Taguchis experimental array to predict the relationship between design variables and responses. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then applied to search for the optimum design of <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> parison programming. As the number of training samples is greatly reduced due to the use of orthogonal arrays, the prediction accuracy of the neural network model is closely related to the distance between sampling points and the evolved designs. The extrapolation distance concept is proposed and introduced to GA using fuzzy rules to modify the fitness function and thus improving search efficiency. The comparison of the results with commercial optimization software from NRC demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specific}} peel system low-density polyethylene/isotactic poly-butene- 1 (PE-LD/iPB- 1), {{which is}} often used for protective packages, was investi-gated in this study. The required peel force to open the package depends {{on the content of}} iPB- 1 and on the processing conditions of the blowing process. Commer-cial products have a constant amount of iPB- 1. Thus, a defined peel force can be adjusted by varying the processing conditions. The standard peel system PE-LD with 6 wt % iPB- 1 was investigated in dependence on the processing conditions. The most important processing parameters of the processing line (extruder, die head, tube forming area) were varied and their influence on the peel properties was examined. For example the temperatures of the melt within the extruder, the size of the <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> within the die head, and the cooling behavior of the film bubble were investigated. Higher melt temperatures within the extruder decreased the peel force. The investigations also revealed a strong dependence of the peel force {{on the size of the}} <b>die</b> <b>gap</b> and on the degree of cooling. The new developed parameter time of solidification was used to characterize the cooling behavior.

40|$|International audienceHealth {{regulations}} {{are becoming increasingly}} restrictive which leads to develop solvent free laminating processes. Hot melt adhesives represent an interesting solution to bond two pre-printed substrates of polymer for packaging applications for example, but their high viscosities require extruding the polymer formulation through important <b>die</b> <b>gaps</b> (between 0. 5 mm and 1 mm) in order to limit the extrusion pressure. Thus, delivering a final very thin layer of hot melt (a few μm) between the polymer substrates requires applying very high draw ratios between the die and the contact point on the substrate. These high draw ratios would result in marked thickness and width instabilities (called draw resonance) when using usual stretching distances as in cast film (a few cm) or in coating thermoplastic layers on a metal or paper substrate (more than 10 cm). Surprisingly, reducing drastically the stretching distance (around 1 mm) and applying a differential pressure {{between the two sides}} of the melt allow postponing the instability occurrence. Nevertheless the processing window is narrow and the objective of the present paper is to describe the cotformatating process developed at Bostik Company, to characterize the drawing instabilities and to investigate the influence of different processing parameters.

40|$|During {{extrusion}} of viscoelastic fluids various flow instabilities {{may arise}} {{resulting in a}} distorted free surface. In order to investigate the factors generating these instabilities we performed a linear stability analysis at zero Reynolds number around the steady solution of the cylindrical or planar stick-slip flow for a viscoelastic fluid following the affine exponential Phan-Thien Tanner (PTT) model. Stick-slip flow is an important special case of the extrudate swell problem, since the latter reduces {{to it in the}} limit of infinite surface tension but avoids the complications of a free-boundary flow. The linear stability analysis is performed for various values of the rheological parameters of the PTT model {{in order to determine the}} effects of all material properties. It is found that the flow becomes unstable as the Weissenberg number increases above a critical value, due to a Hopf bifurcation suggesting that the flow will become periodic in time. Both the critical value of the Weissenberg number and the frequency of the instability depend strongly on the rheological parameters of the viscoelastic model. The corresponding eigenvectors indicate that the perturbed flow field has a spatially periodic structure, initiated at the rim of the die, extending for up to 5 - 7 <b>die</b> <b>gaps</b> downstream, but confined close to the surface of the extrudate, in qualitative agreement with existing experiments. This suggests that instability is generated by the combination of the singularity in the velocity and stress fields at the die lip and the strong extension that the extruded polymer undergoes near its surface. The elasticity alone can be responsible for the appearance of instabilities in the extrusion process of viscoelastic fluids and the often used assumptions of wall slip or compressibility, although they might be present, are not required. Finally, the mechanisms that produce these instabilities are examined through energy analysis of the disturbance flow. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
