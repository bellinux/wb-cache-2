25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated electrotyping and stereotyping departments, and electrotyping and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of <b>Electrotypers</b> and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and <b>Electrotypers</b> Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, <b>electrotypers</b> had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 <b>electrotypers</b> and stereotypers were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. Offset printing has supplanted letterpress printing in most printing plants; the last letterpress facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For offset printing, the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with light-sensitive materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and electrotyping are not used.|$|R

50|$|The National Graphical Association (NGA) was a British trade union.

These skills developed into separate trades, and the printing process involved [...] "compositors, pressmen, feeders, stereotypers, bookbinders, <b>electrotypers,</b> and photoengravers." [...] These various trades had all belonged to the Typographical Union, but between 1889 and 1903 all except for the compositors left to form their own craft unions. The AFL supported this process of separation by skill.|$|R

40|$|Based {{upon the}} unparalleled {{collection}} of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Literature {{held at the}} American Antiquarian Society, this comprehensive directory contains 2, 600 entries documenting the activity of individuals and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of childrens books in the United States chiefly between 1821 and 1876. Nationally known firms such as McLoughlin Bros. and non-profit publishers like the American Sunday-School Union are included, as well as prominent educational pioneers such as Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Samuel Griswold Goodrich, and William Bentley Fowle. The directory also reflects the dynamic growth of childrens book production in the major publishing centers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia [...] {{as well as in}} regional markets such as Rochester, Mobile, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. In short, the Directory documents both a book industry and an American childrens literature that are coming of age in the midst of stunning technological advances, sweeping social change, and great economic upheaval. The main file (accessed through the Download button to the right) includes name, dates of operation, and address. Other files are as indicated. In toto, the files include: Heading (name of person or firm), Street address, City, State (two-digit postal code), Country (countries outside of the United States; used to document people/firms operating in both the United States and another country such as England); Chronological Date Range of Street Addresses; Role, and Notes. “Role” refers to the following terms: Agent Amateur printer Amateur publisher Binder Binding designer Bookseller Copperplate printer Editor <b>Electrotyper</b> Engraver Games publisher Importer Ink maker Lithographer Lithotyper (Stereotyper) Paper dealer Paper manufacturer Printer Publisher Self-publisher Stationer Stereotyper Wholesale bookseller The Note index file contains more information about the entry, such as dates of books issued by the individual/firm that are held at the American Antiquarian Society. This information is particularly useful to track the activity of persons and firms operating in towns and smaller cities for which no published street directory could be located. The Note index also includes citations to published sources about the individual or firm whenever available. As many of these individuals and firms indexed also manufactured and distributed books for adults, the Directory will prove to be a crucial resource for researchers, collectors, book dealers, and virtually anyone seeking a better understanding of American publishing during the nineteenth century.

2500|$|Electrotyping (also galvanoplasty) is a {{chemical}} method for forming metal parts that exactly reproduce a model. The method {{was invented by}} Moritz von Jacobi in Russia in 1838, and was immediately adopted for applications in printing and several other fields. As described in an 1890 treatise, electrotyping produces [...] "an exact facsimile of any object having an irregular surface, whether it be an engraved steel- or copper-plate, a wood-cut, or a form of set-up type, {{to be used for}} printing; or a medal, medallion, statue, bust, or even a natural object, for art purposes." [...] In art, several important [...] "bronze" [...] sculptures created in the 19th century are actually electrotyped copper, and not bronze at all; sculptures were executed using electrotyping at least into the 1930s. In printing, electrotyping had become a standard method for producing plates for letterpress printing by the late 1800s. It complemented the older technology of stereotyping, which involved metal casting. By 1901, stereotypers and <b>electrotypers</b> in several countries had formed labor unions around these crafts. The unions persisted into the 1970s, but by the late 20th century, after more than a century in widespread use for preparing plates, the two technologies had been bypassed by the transitions to offset printing and to new techniques for the preparation of printing plates.|$|R
