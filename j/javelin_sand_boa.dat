50|$|Eryx jayakari, known {{commonly}} as the Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> or Jayakar's <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> is {{a species}} of snake in the Boidae family. It is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula and Iran where it spends the day buried in the sand. Both the specific name, jayakari, {{and one of the}} common names, Jayakar's <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> are in honor of Atmaran S. G. Jayakar (1844-1911), an Indian surgeon and naturalist.|$|R
5000|$|The European snakes include {{colubrids}} (grass snakes, smooth snake, western whip snake, garter snake, Aesculapian snake), many viperids (European adder, blunt-nosed viper, Lataste's viper, Ursini's viper, asp viper) {{and some}} typhlopids (Typhlops) and boas (<b>javelin</b> <b>sand</b> <b>boa).</b> Some widespread lizards include the sand lizard, European green lizard, western green lizard, viviparous lizard, common wall lizard, Iberian wall lizard, Italian wall lizard and others.

50|$|Eryx jaculus {{is found}} in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Africa. In September 2014 the snake has been rediscovered in Romania near the Danube after being extinct in Romania since 1937 when the last {{specimen}} was seen near Cochirleni. In late 2015 the snake has been rediscovered near Licata on the south coast of Sicily after not having been officially recorded in Italy for eighty years; {{it is possible that}} the <b>javelin</b> <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> was introduced in Sicily by Greek settlers in antiquity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>javelin</b> <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> {{may grow}} to 80 cm in total length (including tail). Coloring varies greatly. Dorsally, {{it may be}} grayish, tan, brownish, or reddish, with darker blotches or bars in an {{irregular}} network. It usually has a dark streak from the eye {{to the corner of}} the mouth. Ventrally it is whitish or yellowish. It is heavy-bodied and has a short blunt tail. The ventrals are very narrow, less than ⅓ of the width of the body. The rostral is large and broad with an angular horizontal edge. The eye is separated from the labials by one or two rows of small scales. There are 10-14 upper labials. The dorsal scales are in 40-50 rows, smooth anteriorly, but weakly keeled posteriorly. There are 165-200 ventrals, and 15-34 subcaudals.|$|E
50|$|Otherwise {{far removed}} from their boine relatives, they are {{generally}} ovoviviparous, i.e., giving birth to live young. At least three species lay eggs, however: the Calabar python, Charina reinhardtii (once regarded as a python for this reason), the Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> Eryx jayakari, and the West African <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> E. muelleri.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a population of the <b>Javelin</b> <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> Eryx jaculus in Sicilia is here reported for the first time. Observations of live snakes and road-killed individuals have been obtained from the region of Licata (Province of Agrigento), {{in the southern part}} of Sicily. Data on the distribution and pholidosis from four specimens are presented. The large area of occurrence of the snake in Sicily, that bears also a local vernacular name suggests an ancient origin of the colonization. The {{presence of}} this species, increases the numbers of snakes living in Italy. </p...|$|E

50|$|Eryx somalicus, known {{commonly}} as the Somali <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> is {{a species}} of small snake in the Boidae family. As its scientific name and common name suggest, it is found in Somalia, but may also be present in eastern Ethiopia.|$|R
5000|$|The Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> {{is listed}} by the IUCN as being of [...] "Least Concern". This {{is because it}} has a very wide range, is common in at least parts of that range, and no {{particular}} threats have been identified.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>boas</b> have no {{distinct}} neck, {{the body}} is cylindrical and the tail is short and tapering. The eyes are small with vertical pupils. The Somali <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> is somewhat variable in colouring. The basic colour of the dorsal surface is some shade of brown with about thirty transverse or semi-oblique whitish bands, sometimes with dark margins. Some bands fuse together forming [...] "Z" [...] or [...] "Y" [...] shaped markings. Each dorsal scale has a pale central portion which results in fine longitudinal striations along the dorsal surface. The ventral surface is whitish, sometimes spotted with small spots of dark colour or with larger rounded dark patches, usually aligned with a dorsal bar.|$|R
40|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> (Eryx jaculus) {{is one of}} {{the least}} known and rarest reptile species in Europe. InRomania, the <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> is the rarest reptile species with only four {{locality}} records being known; atCernavodă, Cărpiniş-Giuvegea, Cochirleni and Mahmudia (Kirițescu 1903; Fuhn & Vancea 1961; Zinke &Hielscher 1990). To estimate the predictors and the probability distribution of the target species (Eryxjaculus) we used MaxEnt 3. 3. The potential distribution model of E. jaculus in Romania have a very goodscore performance (AUC = 0. 959). The most important variables for the model are BIO 13 (92. 5 % ofcontribution), BIO 9 (3. 2 % of contribution), BIO 17 (3 % of contribution) and BIO 6 (1. 3 % of contribution). A previously mentioned hypothesis regarding the extinction of the <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> from Romania hold theconstruction of the Danube River – Black Sea canal as the main responsable factor, this constructionhaving destroyed most of the natural habitats in which the species has been recorded (Krecsak & Iftime 2006). We also support this hypothesis as the generated model indicates a suitable niche for the speciesalong the current canal area...|$|R

50|$|Some herpetologists believe, because D. russelii is so {{successful}} {{as a species}} and has such a fearful reputation within its natural environment, another snake has come to mimic its appearance.

50|$|Red <b>sand</b> <b>boas</b> {{have many}} superstitious beliefs {{attributed}} {{to them because}} of their double-headed appearance, such as bringing good luck, curing AIDS, etc. Such blind faith has resulted in endangering the species, and in illegal trade in India, despite being a protected species under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, of India.|$|R
