Based on the disease phase and extent, patiens with prostate carcinoma diagnosis are treated with number of different therapies including radical prostatectomy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, brachytherapy, conventional radiotherapy, conformal radiotherapy and combination of these. This Bachelor Thesis deals with prostate carcinoma treatment using a special conformal radiotherapy method - IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy). The first section describes the disease charakter from the clinical {{point of view and}} the disease diagnosis, followed by treatment modalities. The main part examines and describes IMRT, treatment planning and resultes from statistic evaluation of <b>irradiation</b> <b>position</b> deviations. IMRT technique allows escalation of the irradiation dose while protecting critical structures. In this way the patient can be irradiated with a total dose of 80 grays (Gy). Patients are irradiated in a linear accelerator. Modulation of the radiation beam using multileaf collimator allows irradiation of different segments of target volume with different doses, so that overal homogenity of the irradiation treatment is achieved through nonhomogenous distribution of the dose. Escalation of the irradiation dose is in a close relationship with the irradiaion position and isocentre position kontrol, so that the treatment quality is guaranteed preventing damane to surrounding healthy tissue. Fixing the patient in <b>irradiation</b> <b>position</b> as well as reproductibility of the position is of essentials importance. The isocentre in <b>irradiation</b> <b>position</b> is verified efore every fraction. Verification portal images are acquired using EPID (Electonic Portal Image Device) Portal Vision LC 250 and then compared with reference verification images acquired by CT when planning the treatment. Portal images are made up of two fields of 12 x 12 cm size under 0 and 90 or 270 degrees. Deviations are recorded in craniocaudal, mediolateral and anterior-posterior axes, and if they exceed 3 mm, the <b>irradiation</b> <b>position</b> is corrected on the irradiation table. In this Thesis, deviations in a group of 30 patients were evaluated using the Aria-Offline Review programme which is an accesory to the treatment planning system. In one third of the statistical group of patient, deviations identified using on offline review were compared with deviations identified by start efore each fraction. Dutiny statistical processing, deviations were recorded within ranges 0 - 3 mm, 3, 1 - 5 mm and over 5 mm. 69 % of acceptable deviations were recorded within the 0 - 3 mm range in the craniocaudal axis, 71 % in the mediolateral axis and 67 % in the anterior-posterior axis. Based on a complete analysis and evaluation of the deviations we can conclude that verification of the <b>irradiation</b> <b>position</b> in treatment of prostate carcinoma using IMRT is essentials to guarantee the irradiation treatment quality. We have also verified that deviations between 0 and 3 mm are acceptable and in no way impair the treatment quality...|$|E

40|$|A {{project was}} {{initiated}} at the Jožef Stefan Institute to develop methodology for the {{validation of the}} computational models for the TRIGA reactor. A detailed computational model of the TRIGA Mark-II reactor with the MCNP Monte Carlo particle transport code was developed. A special feature of the model is flexible input design that allows relative simple modeling of operational characteristics such as fuel shuffling operations, control rod positions, etc. Validation of the spatial flux distribution {{was done by the}} first campaign of measurements in which Al-Au (0. 1 % Au) monitor foils were irradiated in 33 positions in the core and its periphery. The results showed a very good agreement between measured and calculated spatial flux distributions in the reactor core and are reported by Trkov et al [1]. To validate the neutron spectra in commonly used <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions</b> series of activation experiments was performed. A larger number of monitor materials were irradiated in two irradiation positions: the CC and one channel in the carrousel facility (IC 40). Monitors irradiated in the first experiment included gold, aluminium, zirconium, zinc, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and manganese. The second experiment was performed to confirm the estimated neutron spectra in the central channel (CC) and IC 40. Monitors irradiated in the second experiment included gold, aluminium, uranium, thorium and tungsten. The preliminary results of the neutron spectrum analysis in different irradiation channels show good agreement of the reaction rates calculated from measured specific saturation activities and the values obtained from the cross sections and the final calculated spectra for both investigated <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions.</b> It is therefore assumed that the calculated neutron spectrum represents the true neutron spectrum in the observed <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions</b> and that it can in future be used for the validation of the nuclear cross section data. ...|$|R

Moreover, a very precise knowledge of the flux in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions</b> is helpful for benchmarking the simulation models of the reactor. In particular, an MCNP model of the TRIGA Mark II reactor installed at LENA (Laboratory of Applied Nuclear Energy) of the University of Pavia was developed in the recent years, describing the geometries and the materials of the whole reactor with very good accuracy. In this article, we present the results of the neutron flux measurements in four <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions.</b> The neutron activation technique was used to perform an absolute measurement of the flux. Various samples containing a known amount of elements were irradiated in the reactor facilities and the activation rate {{of a large number of}} isotopes was measured through γ-ray spectroscopy with very low background HPGe detectors. In order to accurately calculate the activation rate, Monte Carlo codes based on GEANT 4 were developed to evaluate the γ-ray detection efficiency for every radioisotope of interest. The samples were measured with three different HPGe detectors and the measurements were repeated in various geometric configurations in order to assess the reliability and repeatability of this analysis technique. The MCNP reactor model was used to evaluate the energetic neutron flux distributions in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions.</b> The effective activation cross sections were computed from these distributions, testing the dependence on the MCNP simulation results.

40|$|The ATR is a pressurized, light-water moderated and cooled, beryllium-reflected nuclear {{research}} reactor {{with a maximum}} operating power of 250 MWth. The unique serpentine configuration of the fuel elements creates five main reactor power lobes (regions) and nine flux traps. In addition to these nine flux traps there are 68 additional <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions</b> in the reactor core reflector tank. There are also 34 low-flux <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions</b> in the <b>irradiation</b> tanks outside the core reflector tank. The ATR {{is designed to provide}} a test environment for the evaluation of the effects of intense radiation (neutron and gamma). Due to the unique serpentine core design each of the five lobes can be operated at different powers and controlled independently. Options exist for the individual test trains and assemblies to be either cooled by the ATR coolant (i. e., exposed to ATR coolant flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and neutron flux) or to be installed in their own independent test loops where such parameters as temperature, pressure, flow rate, neutron flux, and energy can be controlled per experimenter specifications.

This useful isotope can be produced by creating molybdenum- 99 (Mo- 99) and letting it decay via beta particle emission to the wanted Tc- 99 m. Today most major producers use High Enriched Uranium (HEU) to create the Mo- 99. In an attempt to demonstrate a method that does not use weapons-grade uranium, the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is trying to produce Mo- 99 isotopes by irradiating Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) foils instead of the normally used HEU. Because the target (LEU) is still 19. 75 % enriched, approximately 0. 75 kW/g of heat will be released during the process and {{because we do not}} want it to overheat or melt we need to know how much cooling water is passing by the target and how much heat is taken away from it. There are a lot of ways to measure water flow velocity. In this case, the goal is to get accurate measurement in a small non-uniform tube 30 feet underwater on a research nuclear reactor. The bulk flow over the desired positions is available, and with this some calculations can be made to get the velocity on the <b>irradiation</b> <b>positions.</b> These calculations then can be compared with an actual measurement in pressure drop from where a flow velocity then can be derivate. To further increase the precision of the results a Constant Temperature Anemometer (CTA) will be used to measure the actual velocity of the flow in certain areas of the irradiation points.
