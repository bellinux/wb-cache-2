500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed. [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E

I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering King's work. Shortly after King's death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (The Arrangement) (1969) which was about to begin production in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. [...] "I felt I'd better go find out where it is; {{what it is to be}} black in this country; what this rage is all about," [...] Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show Joey Bishop Show. In A's Biography episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states, [...] "I'll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he kept walking and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot." ...|$|E

60|$|With {{that civil}} speech, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> my heel; and the prisoners near all burst out laughing. Gentleman Jones, {{not in the}} least altered or ruffled, {{smoothed}} down his wristbands, smiled, and walked away.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> away <b>on</b> my {{heel and}} fell moodily to contemplating the {{mountain}} of luggage. A huge packing-case attracted my attention, and I was staring at it when she spoke at my shoulder.|$|R
