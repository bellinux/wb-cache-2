5|$|Spring Brook flows {{across the}} Pocono Plateau and {{passes through the}} Moosic Mountains via a water gap known as the Spring Brook Gap. <b>Its</b> <b>mouth</b> is in the Lackawanna Valley. In its lower reaches, the stream is {{channelized}} in a large open concrete channel. A number of bank stabilization projects have been done on the stream from Berlin Village downstream to <b>its</b> <b>mouth.</b> Some land {{in the vicinity of}} the stream is designated as a 100 year floodplain.|$|E

5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in <b>its</b> <b>mouth</b> and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with <b>its</b> <b>mouth</b> open to catch small particles of food.|$|E

500|$|The Tangascootack Creek {{watershed}} consists chiefly of {{valleys and}} rolling and broken hills. The creek's river channel is relatively sinuous.

50|$|The Rift {{which appears}} in the long-running British science-fiction series Doctor Who and its {{spin-off}} Torchwood is a wormhole.

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to <b>its</b> <b>mouth,</b> the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as <b>its</b> <b>mouth.</b> The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach <b>its</b> <b>mouth.</b> Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E

25|$|In its delta, the Danube {{is divided}} into three main branches, none of which is suited to optimal {{navigation}}: Chilia branch is the deepest, but <b>its</b> <b>mouths</b> were not stable, which made navigation dangerous; Sulina branch is not deep enough for maritime ships to navigate on it and it also used to be isolated from the railroad system; Sfântu Gheorghe branch is shallow and sinuous.|$|R

5|$|Historically, a Native American path {{went from}} Council Cup up the Little Wapwallopen Creek valley and to Wilkes-Barre. The path ran from Council Cup {{to the creek}} and then {{northeast}} alongside it before going past Lily Lake and over Penobscot Mountain towards where Wilkes-Barre is now located.

60|$|This earth, then, or {{at least}} the {{habitable}} part of it, was considered as most probably a flat plane. Below that plane, or in the centre of the earth, was the realm of endless fire. It could be entered (as by the Welsh knight who went down into St. Patrick's Purgatory) by certain caves. By listening at the craters of volcanoes, which were <b>its</b> <b>mouths,</b> the cries of the tortured might be heard {{in the depths of the}} earth.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at <b>its</b> <b>mouth.</b> However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location.
