500|$|Final mixing for {{the song}} took place on 21 June as the Beatles rushed to {{complete}} Revolver before beginning {{the first leg of}} their 1966 world tour. Harrison discussed [...] "Love You To" [...] with Shankar when the two musicians met that month, at a social event hosted by the Angadi family. Although he was unaware of the band's popularity and had yet to hear [...] "Norwegian Wood", Shankar was impressed with Harrison's humility as the guitarist downplayed his sitar recordings with the Beatles as merely [...] "experiments". Soon after this meeting, Shankar gave Harrison his first sitar lesson at Kinfauns, his and Boyd's home in Surrey, and later, with tablist Alla Rakha, performed a private recital there for Harrison, Lennon and Starr. Harrison subsequently recalled of his first lesson with Shankar: [...] "I felt I wanted to walk out of my home that day and take a one-way ticket to Calcutta. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> have left Pattie behind in that moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cowell was {{confirmed}} to return {{as a judge}} for the 12th series. In April 2015, Walsh sighted his desire to quit the show and return to management, {{and that it would}} take serious thought for him to return for the series' 12th series. He also revealed {{that he was in the}} dark about whom Cowell had the intentions of bringing onto the panel. On 14 May 2015, Walsh confirmed his exit from the series, stating, [...] "The truth is I've done it for 11 years; I never thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> be on TV for four or five. To get 10 was great, to get 11 was amazing - I'm not hanging around for them this year." [...] On 16 June, it {{was confirmed}} that Fernandez-Versini would return to the panel, alongside new judges radio personality Nick Grimshaw and series 9 guest judge, Rita Ora, who was previously a coach on the rival show, The Voice UK.|$|E

2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Russian {{delegation}} is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Sahib, {{it is not}} that; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go, <b>even</b> if <b>I</b> {{felt sure}} I should be found out and cut to pieces. Anything {{would be better than}} this. I am not afraid at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it is true," [...] {{continued}} Rosco hurriedly. [...] "I had {{no intention}} of letting murder be done. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>even</b> slay the captain who has used me so ill. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> give my life if I could alter it now--but I cannot." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> {{question}} whether {{in such a}} great modern state as the U.S.A. the idea and {{the functions of the}} president may not be made too important. Indeed I believe that question has been asked by many people in the States lately, and has been answered in the affirmative.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh ha!' said Charles, {{with a wink}} of {{superior}} wisdom, 'we understand that. She knows how to keep you on your good behaviour. Why, but for cutting you out, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> make up to her myself--fine-looking, comely woman, and well-preserved--and only the women quarrel with that splendid hair. Never mind, my boy, I don't mean it. I wouldn't stand in your light.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Le Smyrger. [...] "And I {{will never}} see him again unless he asks your pardon on his knees. I have told him so. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>even</b> give him my hand as he went." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{surprised}} at thee, son," [...] said Simeon; [...] "thy mother never taught thee so. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>even</b> {{the same for}} the slaveholder as for the slave, if the Lord brought him to my door in affliction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} request," [...] said the keeper, [...] "but for my friend O-Zar <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do <b>even</b> more, though of course--" [...] he hesitated--"it is {{customary}} for one who would be chief to make some slight payment." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{ever there}} was {{anything}} to which, from reason, nature, habit, and principle, I am totally averse, it is persecution for conscientious difference in opinion. If these gentlemen complained justly of any compulsion upon them on that article, I would hardly wait for their petitions; as soon as I knew the evil, I would haste to the cure; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> run before their complaints.|$|E

"The horses {{must have}} {{food and a}} rest," [...] he said, [...] "before we set out again; and though it's hardly probable, as the peasants are so hostile, that the owner of this place is friendly, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> at the worst rather {{fall into the hands}} of a gentleman than into those of these peasants, who would {{certainly}} murder us in cold blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} about that," [...] {{answered}} the Brabanter, [...] "but this I know, that though I have served for fourteen years, I have never yet seen an Englishman do aught with the long-bow which I {{could not do}} better with my arbalest.

6000|$|... "Then is our combat {{uncalled}} for," [...] said Erling, {{lowering his}} point, [...] "for I desire not {{the hand of}} Ada, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fight <b>even</b> to the death for her blue-eyed sister, could I hope thereby to win her love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not so {{interpret}} them," [...] she replied; [...] "I do but {{submit to}} your presence as an unavoidable evil. Heaven be my witness, that, {{were it not}} to prevent greater and more desperate evil, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>even</b> so far acquiesce." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{looking on}} the picture of this young girl, Diogenes remembered the words which her own brother had spoken to him only a few moments ago; [...] "her honour and her safety are forfeit to me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> kill you if you cheated me, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>even</b> then regret what I had done." ...|$|R
60|$|This longing grew upon me. I became restless with it. In {{the daytime}} I dreamed over my work. At night my sleep was broken and restless.

6000|$|... "You propose, then," [...] she remarked, [...] "that I shall {{still be}} {{saddled with a}} pseudo husband. I think not, Annabel.

60|$|Of {{the finer}} kinds of romance, as {{distinguished}} from the novel, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>even</b> encourage the writing, though {{it is one of}} the hard conditions of romance that its personages starting with a 'parti pris' can rarely be characters with a living growth, but are apt to be types, limited to the expression of one principle, simple, elemental, lacking the God-given complexity of motive which we find in all the human beings we know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father," [...] she said, [...] "at least tell me {{that you}} believe me. Though you may think that I might love to all extremes, surely, having known me so many years, you cannot think that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lie <b>even</b> for my love's sake." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{asked him}} what he meant by coming here to asperse my character. I asked him who the deuce he was. I asked him how he came to know {{anything}} about Mameena, and finally I told him that soon or late <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>even</b> with him, and paused exhausted.|$|R
