[...] Buildings as far west as Fourth Street (four blocks west of, and parallel to, the riverfront), and the historic fire station, were pumping out their basements due to the <b>flood</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> {{breached}} the Coralville Reservoir spillway, damaging more than 20 major campus buildings.

50|$|During the Missoula <b>Floods</b> <b>water</b> {{backed up}} in the Pasco Basin because of the narrow opening of the Wallula Gap. The floods were so large in volume {{that they could not}} rapidly {{discharge}} through the gap, even though it is 2 km wide. Maximum <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> reached elevations of about 380 meters. The hydraulic head required to drive the <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> through the gap, combined with the elevated levels downstream of the constriction resulted in a head of about 250 meters. The peak flow is estimated to have been about 10 million cubic meters per second.|$|R

30|$|Increased tidal {{asymmetry}} {{coupled with}} wetland topography facilitated the inorganic and organic material export from Lower Beaver Pond {{in the interior}} of the wetland. During flood tide, high flows pushed water up and into the elevated region in the northern quadrat of Lower Beaver Pond. As the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> receded, it left a pool of water that was isolated from the rest of Lower Beaver Pond by a sill, which prevented the pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> from fully draining during ebb tide. The pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> facilitated accumulation of inorganic material and the growth and accumulation of organic material. The pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> and its accumulated inorganic and organic material was released back into the wetland during the next <b>flood</b> tide, when <b>water</b> was again pushed into the northern end of the pond and partially drained back into the wetland during ebb. The release of this pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> back into the wetland produced a 40 % increase in the organic and inorganic material export from Lower Beaver Pond on ebb tide. Most of the material flux also occurred on ebb tide for freshwater tidal bayous in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and freshwater tidal wetlands off the Hudson River (Stern et al. 1991; Arrigoni et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Water {{pollution}} {{associated with}} flooding {{is one of}} the major problems in cities in the global South. However, studies of water quality dynamics during flood events are not often reported in literature, probably due to difficult conditions for sampling during <b>flood</b> events. <b>Water</b> quality parameters in open water (canals, rivers, and lakes), <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> on roads and water in sewers have been monitored during the extreme fluvial flood event on 7 October 2013 in the city of Can Tho, Vietnam. This is the pioneering study of urban <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> pollution in real time in Vietnam. The results showed that water quality is very dynamic during flooding, especially at the beginning of the event. In addition, it was observed that the pathogen and contaminant levels in the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> are almost as high as in sewers. The findings show that population exposed to <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> runs a health risk that is nearly equal to that of being in contact with sewer water. Therefore, the people of Can Tho not only face physical risk due to flooding, but are also exposed to health risks...|$|R
