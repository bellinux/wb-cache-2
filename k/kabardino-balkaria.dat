25|$|As {{a result}} of tensions, {{politics}} in all three republics are often highly ethnic-based, and in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and Karachay–Cherkessia, the dispute is often three-way (Russians vs. Circassians and Abazins vs. Karachay in Karachay–Cherkessia; Russians vs. Kabardins vs. Balkars in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria).</b>|$|E

25|$|From June until August 2003 Basayev {{lived in}} the town of Baksan in nearby <b>Kabardino-Balkaria.</b> Eventually, a {{skirmish}} took place between the terrorists and policemen from Baksan, who came to check {{what turned out to be}} Basayev's safehouse. Basayev escaped, killing a local police official.|$|E

2500|$|According to ITAR-TASS, {{the head}} of the {{religious}} affairs department of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria's</b> Ministry of Culture, Dzhambulat Gergokov, claimed that the [...] "bandit underground" [...] in the republic was funded via non-governmental organizations working in Chechnya.|$|R
25|$|At present, {{there are}} six {{independent}} Turkic countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan; There are also several Turkic national subdivisions in the Russian Federation including Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Khakassia, Tuva, Yakutia, the Altai Republic, <b>Kabardino-Balkaria,</b> and Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to Russian).|$|E
25|$|In 70 {{years of}} <b>Kabardino-Balkaria,</b> North Ossetia, the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast {{children}} of indigenous nationalities were denied {{the opportunity to}} study in their native language And we have operated {{since the beginning of}} 25 Abkhaz schools, recently the same time - 73 (Abkhazian and mixed), where the language of the titular nation were more than four thousand children.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, a {{court in}} <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> charged two Malgobeksky District ROVD police officials, Mukhazhir Yevloyev and Akhmed Kotiyev, with negligence, {{accusing them of}} failing to prevent the attackers from setting up their {{training}} and staging camp in Ingushetia. The two pleaded innocent, and were acquitted in October 2007. The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ingushetia in March 2008. The victims said they would appeal the decision to the European Court for Human Rights.|$|E
50|$|The republic's {{economy was}} very hard hit {{by the fall of}} the Soviet Union and the {{outbreak}} of war in neighboring Georgia and nearby Chechnya. The instability produced by the conflicts led to a collapse in tourism in the region and produced an unemployment level estimated to be as high as 90%. The republic's mainly Muslim population has become increasingly radicalised by the region's instability. In October 2005, <b>Kabardino-Balkaria's</b> capital Nalchik was the site of fighting after an attack on the city by Chechen militants.|$|R
50|$|The {{republic}} saw a flare-up {{of violence}} in late 2010 and early 2011, {{in the wake of}} the death of Anzor Astemirov, a senior figure in the Caucasus Emirate and the head of its United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay. The new leaders of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria's</b> guerrilla movement, Asker Dzhappuyev and Ratmir Shameyev, preferred a more aggressive approach and the militants murdered several civilians in the republic, including Russian tourists. In response, a shadowy vigilante group called the Black Hawks threatened the relatives of some of the Islamists. Dzhappuyev and Shameyev were killed in a special operation by security forces in April 2011.|$|R
25|$|A disjunct {{population}} {{of this species}} has been reported from the area of Trabzon and Rize in northeastern Turkey near the border with Georgia in the 1990s by two Turkish zoologists. Some authorities have accepted this report, but others considered it to be unreliable. Also, one single individual was {{claimed to have been}} shot in 2013 in the nearby <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> Republic (a subject republic of Russia immediately north of Georgia in the Central Caucasus); its remains (including a skull) were analyzed by a biologist from the Kabardino-Balkarian State University in May 2015, who concluded the skull was from a dhole. Recently, in August 2015, researchers from the National Museum of Natural History from Sofia, Bulgaria (including Dr. Nikolai Spassov, the current director of this museum) and the Karadeniz Technical University began an expedition to track and document this possible Turkish {{population of}} dhole. On October 12, 2015, this research team reported the preliminary conclusion that no real evidence exists of a living population of the dhole in Turkey (or in the <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> Republic), pending DNA analysis of samples from the original 1994 Serez-Eroglu skins.|$|E
25|$|The {{congress}} passed a resolution, urging Georgia {{to become the first}} UN-recognized State to recognize the Circassian Genocide. In May 2011, Georgia followed through and recognized the acts as a genocide. Soon after, the Chechen separatist government-in-exile announced that it commended Georgia's decision, and advocated pan-Caucasian solidarity, and Circassians, Georgians, Chechens and other Caucasian diaspora in European countries staged demonstrations to show their support. In appreciation for the Georgian recognition, the Georgian flag was seen flying in Nalchik, the capital of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria,</b> which had been a bastion of anti-Georgian sentiment before the recognition.|$|E
25|$|On 26 or 28 October, the 2nd Romanian Mountain Division and 13th Panzer Division took Nalchik, {{capital of}} <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and {{captured}} 10,000 prisoners in two days, before the advance toward Grozny was stopped again {{west of the}} city at Vladikavkaz. On 5 November, Alagir was seized and the Alagir–Beslan–Malgobek line reached became the farthest German advance in the south. By this time, the gap between Army Groups A and B had left them vulnerable to a counter-offensive. Only the German 16th Motorized Infantry Division remained inside the gap, guarding the left flank of the First Panzer Army by securing the road towards Astrakhan. On 22 November, after several Soviet counter-attacks, Hitler appointed Kleist as Group commander with orders to hold his position and prepare to resume the offensive if Stalingrad could be taken.|$|E
25|$|In early 2002, {{at least}} 50 other {{surviving}} prisoners {{were transferred to}} Camp X-Ray at the newly constructed Guantanamo Bay detention camp at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They were mostly Arabs, including 21 Saudis and nine Yemenis, {{but there were also}} Pakistanis and others, such as Russian national Rasul Kudayev (from <b>Kabardino-Balkaria),</b> who had allegedly joined the Afghanistan-based Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and Abdul Jabar, an Uzbek member of the IMU. In 2004, after three years of detention without trial (at first at Camp X-Ray, until his identity was discovered), the U.S. citizen Yaser Esam Hamdi won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, which affirmed the right of U.S. citizens to habeas corpus and trial; he was released from United States custody without charges and was deported to his native Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|On 23 November 2006, {{large numbers}} of Defense Ministry and FSB troops, without the {{participation}} of Chechen police, supported by helicopters and artillery barrages, {{were reported to have}} surrounded Umarov and his forces in a forest near the village of Yandi-Katar in the Achkhoy-Martanovsky District, on the internal border between Ingushetia and Chechnya. According to Kommersant, Umarov was wounded in the operation but managed to escape the pursuit. He spent the winter months traveling across the mountains to the nearby republic of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> to meet with local jamaats fighting Russian authorities in the region and consolidate the Caucasian Front, the pan-Caucasian Islamic militant network set up by Sadulayev. In April 2007, a group of fighters that might have been personally led by Umarov shot down a desant helicopter with the Spetsnaz GRU troops near Shatoy, killing at least 18 Russian soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} Cossacks, some {{refuse to accept}} {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} standard ethnic Russian people, and claim to be a separate subgroup on par with sub-ethnicities such as the Pomors. In the 2002 Russian census the Cossacks were allowed to a have distinct nationality as a separate Russian sub-ethnical group. The Kuban Cossacks living in Krasnodar Kray, Adygea, Karachayevo-Cherkessia and some regions of Stavropol Krai and <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> counted 25,000 men. However, the strict governance of the census meant that only Cossacks who are in active service were treated as such, {{and at the same time}} 300,000 families are registered by the Kuban Cossack Host. Kuban Cossacks not politically affiliated with the Kuban Cossack Host, such as the director of the Kuban Cossack Choir Viktor Zakharchenko, have maintained at various times a pro-Ukrainian orientation. Zakharchenko has recently changed his position and proposes a unification of Ukraine and Russia.|$|E
25|$|North Caucasus {{region in}} today's {{southern}} Russia including the republics of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, North Ossetia, <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and other republics and oblasts {{of the region}} long formed part of Persia, most notably under the Safavids and Afsharids, and of the Iranian cultural sphere until they were conquered and annexed by Imperial Russia {{over the course of}} the 18th and 19th centuries. Strong Persian cultural influence can be traced up as far as Tatarstan in central Russia. Dagestan remains the bastion of Persian culture in the North Caucasus with fine examples of Iranian architecture like the Sassanid citadel in Derbent, strong influence of Persian cuisine, and common Persian names amongst the ethnic peoples of Dagestan. The ethnic Persian population of the North Caucasus, the Tats, remain, despite strong assimilation over the years, still visible in several North Caucasian cities. Even today, after decades of partition, some of these regions retain a sort of Iranian identity, as seen in their old beliefs, traditions and customs (e.g. Norouz).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time, the Iranians made great {{use of their}} {{artillery}} and the town – which had been ruined by Ottoman occupation – soon fell. Abbas set off to besiege Yerevan, a town that {{had become one of}} the main Turkish strongholds in the Caucasus since the Safavids had ceded it in 1590. It finally fell in June 1604 and with it the Ottomans lost the support of most Armenians, Georgians and other Caucasians. But Abbas was unsure how the new sultan, Ahmed I, would respond and withdrew from the region using scorched earth tactics. For a year, neither side made a move, but in 1605, Abbas sent his general Allahverdi Khan to meet Ottoman forces on the shores of Lake Van. On 6 November 1605 the Iranians, led by Abbas, scored a decisive victory over the Ottomans at Sufiyan, near Tabriz. In the Caucasus, during the war Abbas also managed to capture what is now <b>Kabardino-Balkaria.</b> The Persian victory was recognised in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha in 1612, effectively granting them back suzerainty over most of the Caucasus.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the leaders of}} <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and Adygea sent appeals to the Duma, asking it “to reconsider the {{situation}} and to issue the needed apology.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, {{asked about}} the upsurge in attacks in Dagestan, Ingushetia and <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and whether fighters there {{coordinate}} their actions with the Chechen rebels, the top rebel commander Doku Umarov responded: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} to split Karachay–Cherkessia and <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> has won itself the official support of many Circassians (especially in Karachay–Cherkessia, where Karachay and Russians dominate government posts) {{as well as}} the influential Circassian organization [...] "Adyge Khase".|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{have three}} fronts [...] – in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria,</b> Ingushetia and Dagestan. Fighters in Dagestan and <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> {{communicate}} with the military amir and then through myself. They coordinate all their actions with us. (...) They are ordinary civilians who have risen against arbitrariness toward Muslims in those republics. No matter how hard {{we try to make}} them refrain from combat operations, we will not succeed. They are our brothers in faith and therefore we help them – we share our experience and direct them. God willing, we are planning to send our experienced instructors there this year. We will not leave them on their own. It is our duty to help them." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that unlike in Adygea (22% Circassian as of 2003) and Karachay–Cherkessia (11-16%, depending on if the Abazins are considered Circassian, in 2003), <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> has a clear Circassian (of the Kabardin subdivision) majority (at 55%). However, [...] "after the parliament of KBR ratified the bill ‘On land and territory’ earlier this month, each Balkar living in KBR in turn has received 10.6 hectares of the land while only 1.6 hectares belong to each Circassian" [...] noted Jelyabi Kalmykov, and this soon became a rallying cry at the protest. Ruslan Keshev, the leader of the Circassian Congress in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> declared that [...] "If the government does not listen to us we are ready for radical actions. This is the only homeland we have." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{deputy head}} of the <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> Interior Ministry's anti-organized crime department, Albert Sizhazhev, claimed on 14 February 2006, that the attack in Nalchik was financed by foreign {{intelligence}} agencies. According to NTV, Sizhazhev said the attack was organized by [...] "ringleaders of the bandit underground of Kabardino-Balkaria" [...] who [...] "had the powerful financial support of foreign special services." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October 2005 Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia Nikolai Shepel, {{stated that}} the attack was {{organized}} by [...] "International Terrorist Organizations", that also previously organized the Beslan school hostage crisis, raid on Ingushetia, and the attack on Gosnarkocontrol (drug control agency) in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria.</b> The Duma deputy from Chechnya Akhmar Zavgayev also blamed international terrorists for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defendants}} {{have used}} court hearings to threaten their {{enemies in the}} police and security forces. In February 2011, one of the accused said that Khachim Shogenov, the former interior minister of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria,</b> should be called to give evidence “while he was still alive.” He added: “Such people will be killed in this republic. By the time this process ends, praise be to Allah, they will all be destroyed.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At 1:20pm, the President of Russia's <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> {{republic}} Arsen Kanokov, {{announced on}} Echo of Moscow {{that several of}} the attackers been taken alive.

2500|$|While <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and Karachay–Cherkessia's non-Circassian {{leaders have}} come under fire from Circassian nationalists for [...] "oppression", ethnic Adyge leader Aslan Dzharimov of Adygea styled himself as a {{moderate}} who would balance the centralizing urges of Moscow and the Russians against the autonomism/separatism of the Adyge. Although originally popular on this premise, he soon ended up angering both sides, and Adyge Khase denounced him as a collaborationist and [...] "traitor to the Circassian nation".|$|E
2500|$|In May 1994, {{the then}} Russian President Boris Yeltsin {{admitted}} that {{resistance to the}} tsarist forces was legitimate, {{but he did not}} recognize [...] "the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide". In 1997 and 1998, the leaders of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> and of Adygea sent appeals to the Duma to reconsider the situation and to apologize, without response. In October 2006, the Adygeyan public organizations of Russia, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Syria, the USA, Belgium, Canada and Germany sent the president of the European Parliament a letter with a request to recognize the genocide.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 August 2005, Basayev {{rejoined the}} Chechen separatist government, taking {{the post of}} first deputy chairman. Later this year Basayev claimed {{responsibility}} for a raid on Nalchik, {{the capital of the}} Russian republic of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria.</b> The raid occurred on 13 October 2005; Basayev said that he and his [...] "main units" [...] were only in the city for two hours and then left. There were reports that he had died during the raid, but this was contradicted when the separatist website, Kavkaz Center, posted a letter from him.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent Radio Liberty {{journalist}} Andrei Babitsky {{reported in}} November 2007 that Umarov had again travelled to the Republic of <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> {{to rest and}} recuperate for the winter months. Babitsky said that Umarov was in a poor state of health after taking a fragmentation wound to his mandible (it is possible Umarov received the wound in 2006 when he broke out of a Russian encirclement on the Chechen/Ingush border) and after his leg was injured in a mine explosion. Pro-Moscow Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov offered him medical care if Umarov were to [...] "beg for forgiveness".|$|E
2500|$|Intended to {{coincide}} with protests in Karachay–Cherkessia, Circassian youth groups held mass [...] "national protests" [...] in <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> on 17 November 2009. It was attended by about 3000 people (considering that it {{was limited to the}} city of Nal'chik and the small population of the republic's Circassian population alone, let alone in that city, this is a huge figure). Ibragim Yagan, a leader of a Circassian NGO posted a video on Facebook. It featured him standing under both the flag of the Russian Federation and the Circassian national flag, called upon all Circassian youth to wake up to claim their rights and historic lands. He said that [...] "We have been constantly watched, followed, blackmailed for our political activities... But we cannot lose anymore, because we have already lost everything." [...] Yagan is then drowned out by a wave of cheers.|$|E
2500|$|The Human Rights Watch states: [...] "Although the Russian {{government}} {{continued to}} declare itself officially neutral in the war, parts of Russian {{public opinion and}} a significant group in the parliament, primarily Russian nationalists, {{who had never been}} favourably disposed toward the Georgians, began to tilt toward the Abkhaz at least by December." [...] During this period the Abkhaz side obtained a large number of armor, tanks (T-72 and T-80) and heavy artillery. The question remains whether there were specific orders concerning the transfer of weapons to Abkhaz side and if so, whom they were issued by. Russian border guards allowed the Chechen fighters led by Shamil Basayev to cross into Abkhazia or at least did nothing to prevent them from arriving in the conflict zone. The defense minister in the secessionist government and one of the main organizers of the Abkhaz armed units was the professional Russian military officer Sultan Sosnaliyev from the <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> Republic.|$|E
2500|$|An {{organization}} {{calling itself}} [...] "Union of Slavs", led by Nina Konovaleva and Boris Karatayev, {{was created in}} 1991 to counter the activities of Circassian organizations such as Adyge Khase, and prevent Circassians from removing Russians from positions of prestige and power, {{as well as to}} [...] "protect Russians/Cossacks from Circassian control of the land". In 1991, Union of Slavs in Adygeya actively opposed the establishment of Adygeya as separate from Krasnodar Krai as an ethnic republic within Russia, stating that Circassians were only 22% of the populace and as such, it was not fair to the other 78%. The Union of Slavs has called the increasing autonomy of Adygeya and the activism in Karachay–Cherkessia and <b>Kabardino-Balkaria</b> part of a [...] "dangerous conspiracy" [...] to create a [...] "Greater Circassia", achieve demographic dominance by repatriating Diaspora Circassians, and then marginalize or even expel the Russian residents ("colonists", in Circassian ideology). It has called for the liquidation of the three Circassian republics (two of which are also shared with Karachays or Balkars) due to [...] "discrimination of Russians".|$|E
