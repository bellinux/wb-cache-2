25|$|A {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) is an {{electronically}} modulated optical device shaped into a thin, flat panel made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed {{in front of a}} light source or reflector. In 1964, George H. Heilmeier invented the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> mode found in {{liquid crystal display}}s, wherein an electrical charge is applied which rearranges the molecules so that they scatter light.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, George H. Heilmeier, {{then working}} at the RCA {{laboratories}} on the effect discovered by Williams achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier {{continue to work on}} scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally the achievement of the first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> mode (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in transmissive and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone. In the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK's Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England. The team at RRE supported ongoing work by George William Gray and his team at the University of Hull who ultimately discovered the cyanobiphenyl liquid crystals, which had correct stability and temperature properties for application in LCDs.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Scattering</b> Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} heterodyne {{near field}} scattering (HNFS), originally developed for low-angle static light scattering, {{has also been}} implemented for carrying out <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> While the classical <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> method measures the intensity-intensity correlation function, dynamic HNFS gives directly the field-field correlation function, without any assumption on the statistical properties of the sample, as the ones required by the Siegert relation.

50|$|George Heilmeier {{proposed}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> effect which causes a strong scattering of light when the electric field {{applied to a}} special liquid crystal mixture exceeds a threshold value.|$|E
50|$|The dynamically, or inelastically, {{scattered}} electrons provide {{several types}} {{of information about the}} sample as well. The brightness or intensity at a point on the detector depends on <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering,</b> so all analysis involving the intensity must account for <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering.</b> Some inelastically scattered electrons penetrate the bulk crystal and fulfill Bragg diffraction conditions. These inelastically scattered electrons can reach the detector to yield kikuchi diffraction patterns, which are useful for calculating diffraction conditions. Kikuchi patterns are characterized by lines connecting the intense diffraction points on a RHEED pattern. Figure 6 shows a RHEED pattern with visible Kikuchi lines.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 Heilmeier joined RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey, {{where he}} worked on {{parametric}} amplification, tunnel diode down-converters, millimeter wave generation, ferroelectric thin film devices, organic semiconductors and electro-optic effects in molecular and liquid crystals. In 1964 he discovered several new electro-optic effects in liquid crystals, {{which led to the}} first working liquid crystal displays based on what he called the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> mode (DSM).|$|E

In the present study, autofluorescence of the cornea and <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> in the cornea and vitreous have been measured and compared using two innovative research instruments in twenty-two insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Corneal autofluorescence mean values in each diabetic retinopathy grade significantly correlated with <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> measurements in the vitreous, and in the cornea, thus confirming that changes in the natural fluorescence is strictly correlated with molecular changes of ocular tissues...|$|R
50|$|One {{of these}} {{potential}} effects {{had been discovered}} by Heilmeier in 1964. He {{was able to get}} organic dyes to attach themselves to the liquid crystals, and they would stay in position when pulled into alignment by an external field. When switched from one alignment to the other, the dye was either visible or hidden, resulting in two colored states called the guest-host effect. Work on this approach stopped when the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> effect had been demonstrated successfully.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} {{diffraction}} contribute to RHEED patterns. Some incident electrons undergo a single, elastic scattering {{event at the}} crystal surface, a process termed kinematic scattering. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> occurs when electrons undergo multiple diffraction events in the crystal and lose some of their energy due to interactions with the sample. Users extract non-qualitative data from the kinematically diffracted electrons. These electrons account for the high intensity spots or rings common to RHEED patterns. RHEED users also analyze dynamically scattered electrons with complex techniques and models to gather quantitative information from RHEED patterns.|$|E
50|$|Although successful, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> display {{required}} {{constant current}} {{flow through the}} device, as well as relatively high voltages. This made them unattractive for low-power situations, where many of these sorts of displays were being used. Not being self-lit, LCDs also required external lighting {{if they were going}} to be used in low-light situations, which made existing display technologies even more unattractive in overall power terms. A further limitation was the requirement for a mirror, which limited the viewing angles. The RCA team was aware of these limitations, and continued development of a variety of technologies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> {{provides}} {{insight into}} the dynamic properties of soft materials by measuring single scattering events, meaning that each detected photon has been scattered by the sample exactly once. However, the application to many systems of scientific and industrial relevance has been limited due to often-encountered multiple scattering, wherein photons are scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with nonnegligible contributions from multiple scattering. Especially for larger particles and those with high refractive index contrast, this limits the technique to very low particle concentrations, and a large variety of systems are, therefore, excluded from investigations with <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> However, as shown by Schaetzel, {{it is possible to}} suppress multiple <b>scattering</b> in <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> experiments via a cross-correlation approach. The general idea is to isolate singly scattered light and suppress undesired contributions from multiple <b>scattering</b> in a <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> experiment. Different implementations of cross-correlation light scattering have been developed and applied. Currently, the most widely used scheme is the so-called 3D-dynamic light scattering method. The same method {{can also be used to}} correct static light scattering data for multiple scattering contributions. Alternatively, in the limit of strong multiple scattering, a variant of <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> called diffusing-wave spectroscopy can be applied.|$|R
25|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} radius is numerically similar, {{and can be}} measured with <b>Dynamic</b> Light <b>Scattering</b> (DLS).|$|R
50|$|A common {{dichotomy}} {{in light}} scattering terminology is static light <b>scattering</b> versus <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering.</b> In static light scattering, the experimental variable is the time-average intensity of scattered light, whereas in <b>dynamic</b> light <b>scattering</b> {{it is the}} fluctuations in light intensity that are studied. Both techniques are typically encountered {{in the field of}} colloid and polymer characterization. They also have a broad range of other applications.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, RCA's George H. Heilmeier {{along with}} Louis Zanoni and chemist Lucian Barton {{discovered}} that certain liquid crystals could be switched between a transparent {{state and a}} highly scattering opaque one with the application of electric current. The scattering was primarily forward, into the crystal, as opposed to backscattering towards the light source. By placing a reflector {{on the far side}} of the crystal, the incident light could be turned on or off electrically, creating what Heilmeier dubbed <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering.</b> In 1965 Joseph Castellano and Joel Goldmacher, organic chemists, sought crystals that remained in the fluid state at room temperature. Within six months they had found a number of candidates, and with further development, RCA was able to announce the first liquid crystal displays in 1968.|$|E
50|$|Twisted nematic {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} were {{superior to the}} earlier <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> displays, and soon became widespread. The technology was patented in the United States by Fergason in 1971. He formed his own company, ILIXCO, in 1968 to manufacture liquid crystal displays. His first customers were the Bulova Watch Company and Gruen Watch Company which used the technology to market the first LCD watches using this technology. By {{the end of the}} decade, most of the world's digital watches used this kind of LCD. Fergason held over 150 patents in the United States and over 500 foreign patents. He also was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2001, he founded Fergason Patent Properties, which managed licensing of his patents.|$|E
