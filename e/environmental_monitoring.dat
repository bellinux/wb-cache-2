40|$|AbstractA {{research}} of approaches {{with the purpose}} of the assessment of the impact of environmental regulations on the site selection for construction is presented in this paper. The approaches of the <b>environmental</b> air <b>monitoring</b> in Russia and abroad, and particularly the collection and interpretation of data are also studied. The authors obtained data archives of the <b>environmental</b> air <b>monitoring.</b> This data is interpreted using the Russian method (maximum permissible concentration) and the main foreign one (air quality index). Discrepancies in the interpretation of the <b>environmental</b> air <b>monitoring</b> data are found. In many cases, according to the Russian method, the air quality was considered acceptable but the foreign methodology recommends to limit a long-term outdoor presence of citizens from the risk groups. The deficiencies of the Russian standards in the <b>environmental</b> air <b>monitoring</b> are found and described in the paper.
