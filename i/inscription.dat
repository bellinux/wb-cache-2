5|$|Every runic <b>inscription</b> {{is shown}} with its ID code {{that is used}} in {{scholarly}} literature {{to refer to the}} <b>inscription,</b> and it is only obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic <b>inscription</b> appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which the <b>inscription</b> is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic <b>inscription</b> in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If the <b>inscription</b> was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the page in the publication.|$|E
5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 <b>inscription</b> from Palmyra {{describing}} him as Ras implying {{that he was}} already an adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the <b>inscription</b> at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 <b>inscription</b> {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the <b>inscription</b> (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian <b>Inscription</b> from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The <b>inscription</b> of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the <b>inscription</b> is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the <b>inscription</b> was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
