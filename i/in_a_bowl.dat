5|$|During the 1997 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl selection committee held contracts {{with both the}} Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences.

5|$|For the 20002001 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl {{had the right}} to select the No. 2 bowl-eligible team from both the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Big East Conference.

The conference champions of the ACC and Big East were guaranteed a spot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series game, and there also was the possibility of an at-large BCS selection for any team in each conference if it finished high enough in the BCS Poll but did not win the conference championship.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech running back Darren Evans was named the game's most valuable player.
