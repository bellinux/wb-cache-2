The North American première was broadcast from New York City on 19 July 1942 by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Between October 1940 and 1973 the UK had a {{consumption}} tax called Purchase Tax, which was levied {{at different rates}} depending on goods' luxuriousness. Purchase Tax {{was applied to the}} wholesale price, initially at a rate of 33%. This was doubled <b>in</b> <b>April</b> 1942 <b>to</b> 66%, and further increased <b>in</b> <b>April</b> 1943 <b>to</b> a rate of 100%, before reverting <b>in</b> <b>April</b> 1946 <b>to</b> 33% again. Unlike VAT, Purchase Tax was applied at the point of manufacture and distribution, not at the point of sale. The rate of Purchase Tax at the start of 1973, when it gave way to VAT, was 25%.|$|R

5|$|Decoy was {{transferred}} to the Eastern Fleet in March and was escorting Force B when the Japanese carriers attacked Ceylon. The Japanese never spotted Force B, and the ship remained with the fleet until ordered home in September to convert to an escort destroyer. After Duncans refit was completed in January 1942, she rejoined Force H and escorted several missions to fly off Royal Air Force fighters from aircraft carriers to Malta before she {{was transferred}} to the Eastern Fleet <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Diego Suarez, in early May. She, too, was recalled to the UK to be modified as an escort destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|In March 1919, Iron Duke was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she again served as flagship. The ship went into the Black Sea <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. While en route, the ship stopped in Constantinople on 7 April. There, Iron Duke was involved in the destruction of warships and other materiel that might be used by the Bolsheviks. On 12 May, Iron Duke travelled from Constantinople to Smyrna, where she provided a landing party to occupy some of the city's outer forts. She returned to the Black Sea, where she remained until June, when she returned to the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|On March6, meteorologists from University College London at TropicalStormRisk.com {{issued a}} {{forecast}} {{for the season}} for above average activity, since sea surface temperatures {{were expected to be}} slightly warmer than usual; the group used data by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and compared the potential 28.6storms to the 30-year average of 26.3. The group raised the number of predicted storms <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> 29.6, and again in early May to 30.5. They ultimately overestimated the number of storms that would form. The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the City University of Hong Kong also issued a season forecast in April 2002, predicting 27storms with a margin of error of 3, of which 11 would become typhoons, with a margin of error of 2. The agency noted a stronger than normal subtropical ridge over the open Pacific Ocean, as well as ongoing El Niño conditions that favored development, but expected below-normal development in the South China Sea. These predictions proved to be largely accurate.|$|E

He visited Pennsylvania <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> discuss the Libertarian Party's platform with students from Penn State. Native American activist, and challenger to Paul, Russell Means of South Dakota also appeared at the event. Means had officially announced his Libertarian presidential nomination candidacy a day before Paul. While Means received heightened media attention for his comments regarding Native Americans and militancy, reports in the news media circulated that highlighted Paul's calls for the nation to return to the Gold Standard, and diminish the power of the Federal Reserve. Paul and Means were described as members of the right and left wing of the Libertarian Party, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as Ural owls, eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|E

By October 27, 2004, combined sales of Thrones and Patriots and the base game Rise of Nations had passed one million copies worldwide. On October 28, 2004, Rise of Nations: Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows. The new product included both the original Rise of Nations and Thrones and Patriots. In November 2004, a port of Rise of Nations: Gold Edition was released for Mac OS X. It was published by MacSoft and developed by both Big Huge Games and Westlake Interactive.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of Japanese attacks in 1943 put great strain on the Allied forces {{responsible}} for protecting shipping off eastern Australia. The Australian naval authorities were forced <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the number of}} convoys that sailed so their escort could be increased to at least four warships. The RAAF also greatly increased the number of aircraft allocated to escort convoys and ships sailing independently. Further ships and aircraft fitted for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) became available in May, but were still not adequate to counter the Japanese attacks.|$|E

5|$|Travelling via India, {{where they}} camped at Deolali, near Bombay, the {{battalion}} arrived at Kantara, in Egypt on 25 November 1940 and were transported to Julius Camp in Palestine, where the soldiers undertook further training. Later, they {{were moved to}} Dimra in January 1941, before being sent <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> Mersa Matruh, in Egypt, to defend against a possible German attack there during the Siege of Tobruk. Although no German attack came there, during their time at Maaten Bagush the battalion was subjected to aerial attack. It remained there {{until the end of}} May when the battalion was relieved by a South African battalion. The 21st Brigade then returned to Palestine to begin preparations for operations in Syria and Lebanon against the Vichy French in order to prevent the area from falling {{into the hands of the}} Germans who could then have launched an attack on the Suez Canal from there, or captured the oilfields in Persia (present-day Iran).|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{bounced back}} the {{following}} season, winning their second League title. Arsenal {{had started the}} season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>to</b> clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so {{with an eye to}} the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the campaign, the Australian Army had been the only ground force {{engaging}} in combat with the Japanese in the region. By the end, though, the involvement of US forces in the region had increased as the US Army took over responsibility for the main Allied effort from the Australians. Elsewhere, the 7th Division's advance towards the Finisterre Range saw the capture of Shaggy Ridge and a subsequent advance towards Bogadjim and then Madang, which fell <b>in</b> <b>April,</b> <b>to</b> troops from the 11th Division who had taken over from the 7th Division. With the capture of Madang, the Allied hold on the Huon Peninsula was confirmed, bringing both the Huon Peninsula and Markham Valley campaigns to a close. In July and August 1944, US forces subsequently clashed with Japanese forces, including some of those that had escaped from the Huon Peninsula, around the Driniumor River. Meanwhile, the Australian Army's efforts in the Pacific were scaled back, and it was not until late 1944 and early 1945, when several campaigns were launched in Bougainville, New Britain, Aitape–Wewak and Borneo, that it undertook major campaigns against the Japanese again.|$|E
