25|$|These {{effects are}} derived from two {{fundamental}} observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (<b>EMF)</b> in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current (self-inductance).

By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the cathode which is negatively charged (because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell). If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{problem of}} the spherical antenna {{consisting}} of a thin radial monopole located on a perfectly conducting sphere is solved. The antenna is excited at the base by a voltage δ-generator. An approximate analytical solution of the integral equation for the current on a thin impedance vibrator was found by the method of successive iterations. The solution is physically correct for arbitrary dimensions of the spherical antenna and for any value of surface impedance distributed along the monopole. The validity of the problem formulation is provided by using the Green’s function for the Hertz vector potential in unbounded space outside the perfectly conducting sphere and by writing the initial integral equation for the current on the monopole. Influence of the monopole dimensions and surface impedance upon the radiation characteristics and the input impedance of the spherical antenna is studied by numerical evaluations using zero order approximation.
