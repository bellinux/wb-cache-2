F. microcarpa and F. carica have been excluded as they do not occur in the sanctuary but reported in the previous work due to mis- identification. F. repens has been segregated from F. heterophylla and reinstated as a distinct species with a correct name F. assamica. F. retusa var. nitida forms a new record for the sanctuary. In overall gross morphology, F. hispida, F. palmata subsp. virgata, F. assamica and F. heterophylla exhibit maximum diversity especially in their leaves, pe- duncles and figs. Among all species F. hispida has been found more common especially in low land and moist areas in mixed forest whereas F. retusa var. nitida has been seen with only two plants. All species have been critically examined and provided with correct nomenclature, vernacular name, description, phenology, ecology, uses and reference to voucher specimens.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the relationships between acoustic measurements on <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and ED of lumber [30]. Controversial results have been found. These results and weak correlation found in Tectona grandis can explain that the ultra sound used on <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> are considered less accurate than resonance tools, now commonly used for sorting logs [30]. Thus, acoustic velocity derived from ultra sound readings must be interpreted differently when assessing wood stiffness in <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> [31]. Andrews [30] concluded that squaring the USV will seriously overestimate wood stiffness in <b>standing</b> <b>trees.</b> Furthermore in most studies involving the evaluation of <b>standing</b> <b>trees,</b> the inherent differences between static and dynamic estimates of wood stiffness have been overlooked, thereby producing a bias in the relationship between predicted and observed MOE values [31].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} relationship between dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd) in healthy <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> of Populus deltoides and static modulus of elasticity (MOEs) of sawn lumber from the same <b>standing</b> <b>trees,</b> using nondestructive stress wave testing (NDT). For this purpose, NDT stress wave technique was used. The study was performed on 10 healthy <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> of Populus deltoides. The diameter of trees at the breast height was selected at two categories, namely 25 - 30 cm and 30 - 35 cm. Measurement of wave velocity in <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> were done transversely in radial direction at two geographical directions as North-South and East-West at the breast height, namely 130 cm and longitudinal measurements were done on the height between 80 and 180 cm. Then, <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> were cut following by measurements of wave velocity in their logs. Logs were kept for two months after cutting in order to reduce moisture content. Then, they were cut into the clear specimens for statistical bending test and their MOE were evaluated according to ASTM standard. The results showed that the stress wave velocity and dynamic modulus of elasticity in longitudinal direction of <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and logs were more than those in transverse directions. Also, stress wave velocity and dynamic modulus of elasticity of the logs were higher than those in their <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> at both directions. Finally, regression analysis indicated that the correlation coefficient between MOEd in <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and logs at diameter 30 - 35 cm is (r= 0. 94), which is statistically significant...|$|R

The {{magnitude of the}} velocities of these waves and the calculated dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) were used as indexes for assessing wood quality in <b>standing</b> <b>trees.</b> Results indicated that plantation spacings had moderate influence on the stress-wave and ultrasonic-wave velocities, {{and the degree of}} influence varied with the wave-propagating direction. Regardless of the testing method used, the velocities of waves propagated parallel to the grain in the <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> with medium and poor growth conditions were significantly greater than those with superior growth conditions. The dynamic MOE of the trunk of <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> of Japanese cedar was calculated by adjusting the effective mobility of free water and effective density in the trunk at various moisture contents. Results indicated that the dynamic MOE of wood in the <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> of Japanese cedar was affected somewhat by the testing methods used.

40|$|Canopy network {{reconstruction}} {{from point}} cloud data Quantitative description of tree canopy architecture {{is important for}} creating and validating mathematical growth models of botanical trees (1 - 2), estimating the interactions with the environment (3) and to describe phenotypic traits of the tree canopy (4). In addition to traditional field measurements, emerging technologies like terrestrial laser scanning enable us to capture a 3 -dimensional view of the canopy organization within minutes. However, there are many challenges to decipher the resulting point cloud data and to describe the underlying canopy structure. Network models have been proposed based on theoretical grounds, as suitable approximations to the hierarchical structure of tree branches in the canopy. Here we show {{that it is possible}} to: (i) reconstruct canopy networks from point cloud data; (ii) characterize the statistical properties of these canopy networks. Despite the fact that global network models are sensitive to small sampling errors in the capturing process of the canopy organization, we show that they are powerful to discriminate trees of the same species under significantly different growing conditions. In this case study experiment we compare 6 apple trees (Malus x domestica Borkh. cv. „Honeycrisp‟).

30|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been made to improve teak; however, {{evaluation}} in juvenile step is limited. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct an early assessment of the wood properties of 4 -year-old Tectona grandis. Samples of 36 clones were collected to determine their morphological tree parameters [diameter a breast height (DBH), diameter of the second log, tree height, and log quality]. Presence of growth stress, heartwood percentage, shrinkage (radial, tangential, and volumetric), basic density, and ultrasound velocity (USV) were determined for <b>standing</b> <b>trees,</b> logs, green lumber, and dry lumber. The results indicate that DBH and USV in <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> can be used to predict elastic module (ED), mainly ED of the <b>standing</b> <b>tree</b> and dry lumber, as well as the possible presence of growth stress. Additionally, growth stress can be predicted by UVS in <b>standing</b> <b>tree.</b> Tangential and volumetric shrinkage were not predicted by tree morphology, but radial shrinkage was predicted by diameter and UVS was not affected by any shrinkage. Basic density was predicted by DBH and UVS measured in log.|$|R

In addition, the relationship between characteristics of <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and wood properties was established. Results indicated that the velocity values and bending properties decreased as tree height increased. In addition, velocity values of specimens were greater than those of logs and <b>standing</b> <b>trees.</b> After regressive analysis, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0. 79 for <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and logs and 0. 70 for logs and specimens. Not only the velocities measured by ultrasonic wave (Vu), tap tone (Vf), and vibration (Vt) methods, but dynamic MOE also correlated well with the static bending properties of specimens. In addition, the values of dynamic and static MOE showed the following trend: DMOEu > DMOEf > DMOEt > MOE. For all specimens, the r values were found to be 0. 92 for MOE and DMOEt, and 0. 75 for MOR and DMOEt. Therefore, it was assumed that the nondestructive testing methods can provide basic information about <b>standing</b> <b>trees</b> and specimens for future management practices and utilization of Taiwan incense cedar...|$|R
