For the purposes of selective terror, the CRIO was reconstituted and meetings between high ranking security chiefs were again held in the presidential palace to coordinate the repression. Officers who participated in the CRIO selection process included new jefe of the G-2, Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada; chief of the EMP, Juan Jose Marroquin Salazar and National Police Chief, Col. Hector Bol de la Cruz. In Mejia Victores's first full month in power, the number of documented monthly kidnappings jumped from 12 in August to 56 in September. The victims included a number of US Agency for International Development employees, officials from moderate and leftist political parties, and Catholic priests. Intelligence was [...] "extracted through torture" [...] and used by the CRIO to coordinate joint military and police raids on suspected insurgent safe-houses in which hundreds of individuals were captured and [...] "disappeared" [...] or found dead later. A special counterinsurgency unit of the National Police was activated under Col. Hector Bol de la Cruz known as the Special Operations Brigade (BROE), which operated out of the fifth police precinct in Guatemala City. The BROE carried out the work of National Police squads which had been disbanded under the previous government – such as the Commando Six – and was linked to dozens of documented forced disappearances.|$|E

50|$|Muhammad Ali {{constantly}} admonished {{his son to}} use milder methods, to act justly, and to win {{the people}} over; {{at the same time}} however, he constantly demanded more slaves, which could not be secured without further exactions. Little time was lost in assessing the new territories for taxes, beginning with a census of slaves and flocks. Ismail's secretary Muhammad Said, assisted by Coptic official, Hannah Tawīl, and the former Sennar minister the Arbab Dafa'Allah, devised a system whereby taxes were to be paid at a rate of fifteen dollars per slave, ten per cow and five per sheep or donkey. This rate of taxation was exacting in the extreme, all but amounting to confiscation. Since there was little gold coin in Sudan, the only way most people could pay these taxes was in slaves. This scheme would have centralised all slaving activities in the areas under Egyptian rule, effectively destroying the means of survival of the traders and petty rulers who were economically dependent on the <b>established</b> <b>means</b> of capturing and exchanging slaves.|$|E

50|$|Māori devised ways to mark vowel-length, {{sporadically}} at first. Occasional {{and inconsistent}} vowel-length markings occur in 19th-century manuscripts and newspapers written by Māori, including macron-like diacritics and the doubling of letters. Māori writer Hare Hongi (Henry Stowell) used macrons in his Maori-English Tutor and Vade Mecum of 1911, as does Sir Āpirana Ngata, inconsistently, in his Maori Grammar and Conversation (7th printing 1953). Once the Māori language {{started to be}} taught in universities in the 1960s, vowel-length marking was made systematic. At Auckland University, Professor Bruce Biggs (of Ngāti Maniapoto descent) promoted the use of double vowels (thus Maaori), and this became the standard at Auckland until Biggs died in 2000. The Māori Language Commission, {{set up by the}} Māori Language Act 1987 to act as the authority for Māori spelling and orthography, favours the use of macrons, which are now the <b>established</b> <b>means</b> of indicating long vowels. Occasionally, diaeresis are seen instead of macrons (e.g. Mäori) due to technical limitations producing letters with macrons on typewriters and older computers.|$|E
5000|$|The Couette flow {{orientation}} {{system is}} {{the most widely used}} method of sample orientation for UV LD.

Couette flow is currently the only <b>established</b> <b>means</b> of orientating molecules in the solution phase. This method also requires only very small amounts of analysis sample ( [...] 20 - 40 µl) in order to generate an LD spectrum. The constant recirculation of sample is another useful property of the system, allowing many repeat measurements to be taken of each sample, decreasing the effect of noise on the final recorded spectrum. [...] Its mode of operation is very simple, with the sample sandwiched between a spinning tube and a stationary rod. As the sample is spun inside the cell, the light beam is shone through the sample, the parallel absorbance calculated from horizontally polarised light, the perpendicular absorbance from the vertically polarised light. Couette flow UV LD is currently the only commercially available means of LD orientation.|$|E
