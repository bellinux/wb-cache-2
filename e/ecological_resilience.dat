5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. <b>Ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> and the {{thresholds}} {{by which}} resilience is defined are closely interrelated {{in the way}} that they influence environmental policy-making, legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental policy-making and ensuing legislation.|$|E

Specific types of sustainability include, sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture or ecological economics. Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like [...] "liberty" [...] or [...] "justice".

This paper will explore how this <b>ecological</b> concept of <b>resilience</b> has been taken up both by climate adaptation research and by the Transition Town movement.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> that is {{proposed}} is ultimately about averting our extinction as Walker cites Holling in his paper: [...] " [...] "resilience {{is concerned with}} [...] the probabilities of extinction‚Äù (1973, p.20)". Becoming more apparent in academic writing {{is the significance of}} the environment and resilience in sustainable development. [...] Folke et al state that the likelihood of sustaining development is raised by [...] "Managing for resilience" [...] whilst Perman et al. propose that safeguarding the environment to [...] "deliver a set of services" [...] should be a [...] "necessary condition for an economy to be sustainable".|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} of applying {{the concept of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. [...] Resilience questions the free market model within which global markets operate. Inherent to the successful operation of a free market is specialisation which is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity. [...] This very act of specialisation weakens resilience by permitting systems to become accustomed to and dependent upon their prevailing conditions. In the event of unanticipated shocks; this dependency reduces {{the ability of the}} system to adapt to these changes. Correspondingly; Perman et al. note that; [...] "Some economic activities appear to reduce resilience, so that the level of disturbance to which the ecosystem can be subjected to without parametric change taking place is reduced".|$|E
2500|$|In ecology, {{resilience}} is {{the capacity}} of an ecosystem {{to respond to a}} perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly. Such perturbations and disturbances can include stochastic events such as fires, flooding, windstorms, insect population explosions, and human activities such as deforestation, fracking of the ground for oil extraction, [...] pesticide sprayed in soil, and the introduction of exotic plant or animal species. Disturbances of sufficient magnitude or duration can profoundly affect an ecosystem and may force an ecosystem to reach a threshold beyond which a different regime of processes and structures predominates. Human activities that adversely affect ecosystem resilience such as reduction of biodiversity, exploitation of natural resources, pollution, land use, and anthropogenic climate change are increasingly causing regime shifts in ecosystems, often to less desirable and degraded conditions. Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio-ecological systems, and the need for shift from the maximum sustainable yield paradigm to environmental resource management which aims to build <b>ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> through [...] "resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance".|$|E

Similarly political economic analyses can lack appropriate recognition of the role of ecological reality in political economic crises. In response this paper builds theory by linking key concepts from neo-Gramscian political economic analysis with resilience approaches reflecting social-ecological system dynamism. The objective is to generate a new conceptual approach to better understand the role of politics in social-ecological systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a critical {{discussion of the}} concepts of farm-level viability, sustainability and resilience, which are typically discussed separately in the literature. While farm-level viability frequently focuses on measurable economic factors, sustainability is comparatively more elusive because of its added social, cultural and <b>ecological</b> dimensions. <b>Resilience,</b> in turn, is unambiguous {{in the sense that}} it requires particular conditions, but is achieved in dynamic ways. A traditional resilience strategy in agriculture globally is co-operative action, involving farmers working together to enhance their viability and sustainability, often achieving resilience. We draw attention to agricultural development models that are distinctive because they leverage co-operative action in and between family farms in agricultural communities while pursuing integrated viability, sustainability and resilience strategies. We focus on the prospect of such rural development models, particularly a values-based supply chain approach, and identify crucial considerations and future research needs...|$|R

50|$|Environmental {{governance}} in Brazil {{tends to be}} carried out with a top-down approach, whereby the government puts in place legislation that markets have to abide to. This command-and-control approach has sometimes led to tensions between the governments, business and local communities. An example of this is the establishment of marine and coastal protected areas in Brazil. Restrictions are often imposed on artisanal fisheries without any involvement of the local communities in the decision making, and the negative impact on the livelihood of these local communities has resulted in several conflicts. The <b>ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> of coastal fisheries is also said to be affected by the top-down approach of creating reserves. The lack of local involvement, public participation and co-management is thought to limit <b>ecological</b> <b>resilience</b> and reduce the effectiveness of the coastal reserves in protecting wildlife numbers.|$|E

50|$|Climate {{resilience}} is {{a relatively}} novel concept that {{is still in the}} process of being established by academia and policymaking institutions. However, the theoretical basis for many of the ideas central to climate resilience have actually existed since the 1960s. Originally an idea defined for strictly <b>ecological</b> systems, <b>resilience</b> was initially outlined by C.S. Holling as the capacity for ecological systems and relationships within those systems to persist and absorb changes to ‚Äústate variables, driving variables, and parameters.‚Äù This definition helped form the foundation for the notion of ecological equilibrium: the idea that the behavior of natural ecosystems is dictated by a homeostatic drive towards some stable set point. Under this school of thought (which maintained quite a dominant status during this time period), ecosystems were perceived to respond to disturbances largely through negative feedback systems - if there is a change, the ecosystem would act to mitigate that change as much as possible and attempt to return to its prior state. However, the idea of resilience began evolving relatively quickly in the coming years.|$|R
