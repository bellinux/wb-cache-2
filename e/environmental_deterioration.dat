To reduce environmental impacts, the government made great efforts to struggle <b>environmental</b> quality <b>deterioration.</b> Unfortunately, short-term economic gain still receives priority and many positive forces are offset by earlier negative forces. It is difficult to control the <b>environmental</b> quality <b>deterioration</b> with high economic incensement, but at least slowing down degradation. China's environmental sustainability index remains among {{the lowest in the}} world. Two reasons contribute to the results. First, the distinctive feature of China's environmental policy system is vertical, using a “top down” approach to environmental management, which is marked by a deconcentration of central regulatory authority to other administrative entities. Second is the fragmented authority and budget-allocation problems. China's environmental conservation efforts are managed by different government departments called a “fragmented authoritarianism model. ” Over the short term, the interactions between current positive and negative forces indicate that China's overall environmental conditions will continue to get worse before getting better...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{most studies}} of {{environmental}} reform {{have focused on}} the experiences of advanced, industrialized societies in Europe and the Americas. Discussions of and theories on multi-level and multi-actor (environmental) governance, shifts in governance styles, ecological modernization, and the changing roles of the nation-state, have been supported empirically by case-studies and quantitative statistical analyses from these regions. Such studies may have limited applicability to conditions and processes of environmental governance and practice in Asia, a continent of critical importance for the global environment in the twenty-first century. As state-society relations in Asia have distinct qualities, characteristics, and dynamics, the successes and challenges of environmental reform there differ as well. Few systematic, comparative studies of environmental reform in Asia have been carried out. More common are local or country case studies stressing continuing <b>environmental</b> <b>deteriorations.</b> Analysis of reform efforts in Asia is complicated further by limited availability of reliable sources and data on environmental qualities, pollution patterns and resource extractions in the region. New research strategies, methods, & efforts are badly needed. Combining and assessing quantitative and qualitative approaches, this symposium sets a new agenda for research on environmental reform in Asia, examining experiences and designing methodologies on various key sectors, including urban environmental services, energy, water, air quality, and mining...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} OAEs on the marine {{biosphere}} {{is of interest}} to palaeobiology because OAEs represent major environmental perturbations of the ocean-climate system. As a siliceous group with a long evolutionary history, Radiolaria constitute an interesting proxy to gauge the biotic response of zooplankton. Previous studies suggest that Radiolaria experienced important faunal turnovers during the mid-Cretaceous OAEs. We {{have focused on the}} members of family Archaeodictyomitridae (Early Jurassic-Palaeocene) for which we have first analysed the phylogenetic relationships of its various Cretaceous morphospecies. Our analysis was based on literature review, collection of new material with a high resolution sampling and phenetic analyses performed with the help of PAST software. We find that some previously thought extinctions of Archaeodictyomitrid species during OAE 1 b (late Aptian - early Albian) are in fact pseudoextinctions. Indeed, our material from Albania suggests that a major diversification took place at the base of this OAE. A high-resolution study across the Bonarelli level (OAE 2) confirms the step-by-step pattern of numerous real extinctions (end of lineages), some of which started in the late Cenomanian, long before the C/T boundary. This might suggest that extinctions were not driven by abrupt environmental changes, but by the ca. 2 Ma <b>environmental</b> <b>deteriorations</b> which began with the mid-Cenomanian event...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of "sustainable development", we studied which {{attributes}} are important to people's quality of life (QoL) and which changes in QoL people would expect from future economic and <b>environmental</b> improvements or <b>deteriorations.</b> About 200 adult subjects evaluated {{the relative importance of}} 22 different QoL attributes. They subsequently indicated expected changes in those attributes, under three different scenarios in which economic and environmental conditions would either improve or deteriorate. On average, subjects judged the QoL attributes "health", "family", "environmental quality", "nature" and "safety" to be most important, while "recognition", "comfort", "status" and "spiritual life" were found least important. The most important QoL attributes as well as "security" were judged as more important by women than by men. Also observed were income and age effects on relative attribute importance. Our (Dutch) subjects expected significant and varied negative QoL changes from an environmental-deterioration scenario involving either an improved or a deteriorated economy. In contrast, they had mixed positive-negative QoL expectations about environmental improvement combined with economic deterioration. Subjects high in environmental concern assigned greater weight to "environmental" QoL attributes, and they expected <b>environmental</b> improvement versus <b>deterioration</b> to more strongly affect their QoL-attributes "environmental quality", "nature", "health" and "unity with nature", than did subjects low in environmental concern. We conclude that quality of life can be meaningfully conceived as a multi-attribute value concept, useful for assessing the expected effects of future economic and environmental conditions.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to hypothesize that, if microbial life evolved on early Mars, fossil remnants of these organisms may be preserved on the surface. However, the cooling and drying of Mars probably resembled a cold desert and such an environment is not suitable for the process of fossilization. The frigid Ross Desert of Antarctica is probably the closest terrestrial analog to conditions that may have prevailed {{on the surface of}} the cooling and drying Mars. In this desert, cryptoendolithic microbial communities live in the airspaces of porous rocks, the last habitable niche in a hostile outside environment. The organisms produce characteristic chemical and physical changes in the rock substrate. <b>Environmental</b> changes (<b>deterioration</b> of conditions) may result in the death of the community. Although no cellular structures are fossilized, the conspicuous changes in the rock substrate are preserved as trace fossils. Likewise, microbial trace fossils (without cellular structures) may also be preserved on Mars: Discontinuities in structure or chemistry of the rock that are independent of physical or chemical gradients may be of biological origin. Ross Desert trace fossils can be used as a model for planning search strategies and for instrument design to find evidence of past Martian life...|$|R
