500|$|Hurd {{describes}} additional {{steps taken}} {{to increase efficiency}} and cut production costs: [...] "If you use vehicles that get better gas mileage, that are electric or hybrids, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> lot less in fuel. If you use compact fluorescent bulbs, you're going to {{save a lot of}} money in utilities. If you recycle even your own sets, and use them again, that's going to save money. You don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely." [...] Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And {{the fact that this}} administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is no {{spirit in}} the place," [...] said Devilsdust, [...] "but we mean to infuse some. Some of our friends are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>a</b> visit to-morrow." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the 2001 {{battle for}} control of Eircom with then-largest {{shareholder}} Tony O'Reilly, the Sunday Independent wrote of the inevitability of the sale to O'Brien, writing [...] "The Employee Share Option Trust (ESOT) has made its position clear: better dead than Denis. [...] If they stick to this line it will be almost {{impossible for him to}} secure the votes needed to capture Eircom. Deadlock looms. And what happens if Valentia then walks away, leaving Denis as the highest bidder? Not yet likely, but possible. Sir Anthony is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> silly price for Eircom." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to Gavin's first scenes with Kathy's former husband Phil, {{it was said}} that Gavin [...] "will not be taking no for an answer" [...] and he [...] "doesn't take things quietly", with Treadwell-Collins calling the storyline [...] "a really exciting thriller". Further scenes between Phil and Gavin prompted Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy to think that Phil [...] "may have met his match". A show insider told Inside Soap, [...] "He's not afraid to get his hands dirty, even [...] it means butting heads with the notorious Mitchell family. Phil should watch outâ€”this one's a real handful!" [...] On the storyline where Gavin has Phil kidnapped and demands money to spare his life, an EastEnders insider told Inside Soap, [...] "Gavin knows which buttons to push to frighten Kathy into doing exactly what he wants. He wants that money, he wants her by his side, and if things don't go as he wants, Phil is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> high price." [...] Treadwell-Collins said of the kidnap storyline: [...] "What Gavin does to Phil while he's off screen will take Phil in a whole new direction that will run into next year [...]" [...] Taylforth confirmed that what Gavin does to Phil is the reason Phil starts drinking again, saying [...] "Gavin knows that drinking is Phil's weakness". This has an ongoing impact on Phil and the Mitchells, with Treadwell-Collins calling Phil [...] "a broken man" [...] and confirming it was the start of a storyline that would continue until Easter 2016. The Daily Mail said, [...] "Gavin exploited Phil's weakness for alcohol, forcing him to consume booze and setting him off on a potentially deadly slippery slope." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{neighborhood}} was entirely new to Hal, {{and he was}} at once satisfied that the tall boy was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to Tommy Macklin.|$|E
6000|$|The prince {{just took}} time to shout, [...] "The Firedrake is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>a</b> visit!" [...] and then he soared {{to the top of}} a {{neighbouring}} hill, and looked on at what followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} how rude you were to me, on the day when you were sketching in the summer-house?" [...] Francine asked with snappish playfulness. [...] "I expect you to make yourself agreeable this time--I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>a</b> compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She does, {{having been}} urged {{to do so}} by some meddling friend; for I'm quite sure that she would never have thought of doing so herself, seeing that she {{received}} no damage at all beyond <b>a</b> fright. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> her <b>a</b> visit to-day in reference to that very thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|He would see, {{he would}} see! It {{might be out}} of the question; he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> fancy price, but if it could be done, why, perhaps he would do it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George," [...] she said, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> call at a disreputable-looking news-shop, {{just where}} I am pointing. You can't bring the car there, as {{the street is}} too narrow. You might follow me on foot and be about." ...|$|E
6000|$|Reinhart's {{face was}} gray and hard, like stone. [...] "Send out orders for all {{available}} Security units to be unified under your immediate command.

6000|$|... "We {{can stop}} at the first stationer's shop we pass, and ask {{to look at the}} Directory. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Mr. Lismore <b>a</b> visit?" ...|$|R
500|$|Stephen also {{expressed}} her {{desire for the}} character's departure from the show and asked [...] "When are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dispense with this hopeless character?" [...] During the storyline involving Robin and Sunny, Stephen commented [...] "Is she about to disappear into the sunset with someone else? No such luck. Looks like we're still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> dingo <b>to</b> carry her off." [...] Following Sunny's departure, Stephen said [...] "The relief at Erinsborough becoming a Sunny-free zone is enormous".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about the Dusantes," [...] said Mr. Enderton, [...] "but I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> fifteen dollars <b>a</b> week for board for myself and daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said old Jolyon, [...] "if, {{he thinks}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> fancy price, he's mistaken. I've not {{got the money}} to throw away {{that he seems to}} have. Let him try and sell it at a forced sale, and see what he'll get. It's not every man's house, I hear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, why don't you do it?" [...] {{he demanded}} brutally. [...] "You think that {{everything}} I {{said the other}} day was bluff, eh, and that Stanley Rees' disappearance has driven everything else out of my head? Well, you're wrong, madam. As soon as this infernal business is done with, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to my lawyers." ...|$|E
60|$|The princess {{agreed with}} all that her father said, and orders were issued for vast numbers of {{elephants}} and camels, and gorgeous tents and flags, and litters for the ladies, and horses for the men, to be prepared without delay, as the king and princess were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to the great and munificent prince Wali Dad. The merchant, the king declared, was to guide the party.|$|E
2500|$|After a brief {{sojourn in}} England, Rogers {{returned}} in 1779 {{to raise the}} King's Rangers in Nova Scotia, Canada for General Sir Henry Clinton.

6000|$|... "That is true.

60|$|This I cannot say, {{for here}} my dream ended. The fact is, I {{had fallen asleep}} {{on one of the}} stone benches in the Avenue de Paris, and at this instant was awakened by a {{whirling}} of carriages and a great clattering of national guards, lancers and outriders, in red. His MAJESTY LOUIS PHILIPPE was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to the palace; which contains several pictures of his own glorious actions, and which has been dedicated, by him, to all the glories of France.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see," [...] {{retorted}} the Indian with a scornful laugh. [...] "Tell {{the polar}} bear," [...] continued Meestagoosh, in a contemptuous tone, [...] "that I {{did not expect}} to catch him so soon. I have been fortunate. It was kind of him to come in my way, and to bring his she-bear with him. Tell him that I and my braves are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to his nation, to take a few scalps. I let him know this piece of good news because he will never know it from his friends, as he shall be food for dog very soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all, he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> me <b>a</b> visit," [...] Roger had said.

5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambeziâ€“Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> hundred a {{year for}} your girl to be educated, but it makes no {{difference}} to me how that hundred is spent, providing she gets the education. It seems to me, therefore, {{that it would be better}} if you were to move again, say to Dulwich, where no doubt you have still friends, having lived there for so long. Then you could send her as a day-boarder in a good school for some thirty or forty pounds a year. You could still keep her with you, and have a nice home for Jack whenever he comes back from sea.|$|E
60|$|Lady Montfort heard {{with great}} {{satisfaction}} from Mr. Neuchatel that Lord Roehampton was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit to Hainault at Easter, {{and that he}} had asked himself. She playfully congratulated Mrs. Neuchatel on the subject, and spoke as if the affair was almost concluded. That lady, however, received the intimation with a serious, not to say distressed countenance. She said that she should be grieved to lose Adriana under any circumstances; but if her marriage in time was a necessity, she trusted she might be united to some one who would not object to becoming a permanent inmate of their house. What she herself desired for her daughter was a union with some clergyman, and if possible, the rector of their own parish. But it was too charming a dream to realise. The rectory at Hainault was almost in the Park, and was the prettiest house in the world, with the most lovely garden. She herself much preferred it to the great mansion--and so on.|$|E
60|$|At five oâ€™clock, {{by which}} time they had cleared three masses of weed and a barnacle-covered plank, they {{abandoned}} the search and resumed the voyage. A gloom settled on the forecastle, and the cook {{took advantage of the}} occasion to read Tim a homily upon the shortness of life and the suddenness of death. Tim was much affected, but not nearly so much as he was when he discovered that the men were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> last tribute to the late captainâ€™s memory by abstaining from breakfast. He ventured to remark that the excitement and the night air had made him feel very hungry, and was promptly called an unfeeling little brute by the men for his pains. The mate, who, in deference to public opinion, had to keep up appearances the same way, was almost as much annoyed as Tim, and, as for the drowned man himself, his state of mind was the worst of all. He was so ungrateful that the mate at length lost his temper and when dinner was served allowed a latent sense ot humour to have full play.|$|E
50|$|The courtâ€™s {{ruling was}} much broader than just {{abortion}} {{and family planning}} services; {{if the government is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>a</b> program, it can attach conditions. Under Rust v. Sullivan, federal funds for family planning programs could promote only childbirth options without being considered discriminatory. Other views, particularly abortion services, could not be admitted within the programsâ€™ narrowly defined scope.|$|R

6000|$|... "Allan, I am <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> visit.
