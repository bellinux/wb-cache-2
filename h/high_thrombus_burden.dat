Material/Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 780 patients who underwent PPCI in our clinic due to STEMI. Clinical, laboratory, and demographic properties of the patients were recorded. Angiographic coronary thrombus burden was clas-sified using thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) thrombus grades. Results: Patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> were older, with higher diabetes prevalence longer pain to balloon time, higher leukocyte count, higher admission troponin, and admission CK-MB concentrations. SYNTAX score was higher and myocardial perfusion grades were lower in patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> Multivariate lo-gistic regression analysis revealed SYNTAX score as the strongest predictor of thrombus burden. ROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 75. 5 %, specificity of 61. 2 %, and cut-off value of> 14 (area under the curve (AUC) : 0. 702; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 773 – 0. 874;P< 0. 001) for <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> Conclusions: SYNTAX score may have additional value in predicting higher thrombus burden besides being a marker of cor-onary artery disease severity and complexity...|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association between electrocardiographic (ECG) grade III ischemia and angiographic thrombus burden in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods: The study population consisted of 307 patients with STEMI. Baseline ECGs of the patients were analyzed for grade III ischemia; angiographic thrombus burden was assessed by thrombolysis in myocardial infarction thrombus classification.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of an 82 -year-old Sardinian woman {{affected}} by "favism" (i. e. intolerance to fava beans) with chest pain associated with persistent massive ST elevation in V 2 -V 6 leads, admitted to our department after transfer from a rural hospital without catheterization facilities. On immediate transfer to the catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI), coronary angiogram showed proximal left anterior descending (LAD) thrombotic occlusion. In consideration of her history of glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and "loss of consciousness" at a young age after taking aspirin, which contraindicated aspirin therapy, we treated this patient using a new, two-step strategy, with an emergency minimalist intervention using manual thrombectomy and intracoronary glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIbIIIa) inhibition with abciximab. Subsequent angiography control confirmed the persistence of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial (TIMI) grade 3 flow and the presence of an intermediate proximal LAD coronary lesion, which was not treated, also due to the persisting contraindication to aspirin. In our opinion, minimalist intervention with a thrombectomy device (especially in patients characterized by a <b>high</b> intracoronary <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden)</b> and/or {{with the use of a}} small balloon or gentle dilation, sustained by maximized antithrombotic therapy may represent an interesting and rational approach, allowing interventionalists to postpone stenting in the setting of primary PCI in special cases...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the AngioJet® coronary device, given the uncertain risk-benefit balance of rheolytic thrombectomy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Current risk of inadequate myocardial perfusion for thrombus embolization in primary coronary interventions is not negligible. The AngioJet thrombectomy device showed promising results in terms of safety and efficacy, but failed to confirm them in a large, multicenter, randomized trial, and the risk-benefit balance is still uncertain. METHODS: The AngioJet device was employed in 116 consecutive patients with AMI and angiographic evidence of extensive thrombosis in a vessel with a reference diameter > 2. 5 mm. Stents and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were liberally used. Epicardial and myocardial reperfusion angiographic parameters, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE, i. e., cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization) were assessed. RESULTS: The AngioJet was successfully used in all patients. Angiographic analysis showed that the AngioJet significantly improved epicardial coronary flow (p < 0. 01), frame count (p < 0. 01) and myocardial blush (p < 0. 01), while stenting yielded significant improvements only in diameter stenosis, minimum lesion diameter and correlated vessel parameters (p < 0. 01). In-hospital MACE were uncommon [9 (8 %) ], despite the patients' characteristics. When compared to an AMI population with similar <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> but not undergoing thrombectomy, our AngioJet population showed significant improvement of reperfusion parameters. Moreover, there was greater AngioJet benefit in the <b>high</b> versus moderate <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> subset; laboratory and operator experience also correlated significantly with final angiographic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the favorable risk-benefit profile of AngioJet device use in selected patients with AMI when used in experienced laboratories and by trained operators...|$|R

BackgroundThere are limited data for the safety and effectiveness of DES in STEMI. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 812 consecutive patients treated with DES implantation for STEMI. Intracoronary <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> was angiographically estimated and categorized as large <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (LTB), defined as <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> ≥ 2 vessel diameters, and small <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (STB) to predict clinical outcomes. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as death, repeat myocardial infarction, and IRA reintervention. ResultsMean duration of follow-up was 18. 2 ± 7. 8 months. Large <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 76, p = 0. 023) and MACE (HR 1. 88, p = 0. 001). The cumulative angiographic IRA-ST was 1. 1 % at 30 days and 3. 2 % at 2 years, and continued to augment beyond 2 years. It was significantly higher in the LTB compared with the STB group (8. 2 % vs. 1. 3 % at 2 years, respectively, p < 0. 001). Significant independent predictors for IRA-ST were LTB (HR 8. 73, p < 0. 001), stent thrombosis at presentation (HR 6. 24, p = 0. 001), bifurcation stenting (HR 4. 06, p = 0. 002), age (HR 0. 55, p = 0. 003), and rheolytic thrombectomy (HR 0. 11, p = 0. 03).

40|$|Background Distal {{embolization}} during primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCls), {{may affect}} myocardial reperfusion. We evaluated the prevalence and features of embolization during primary PCI {{and its relationship}} with clinical and angiographic variables. Methods Forty-six consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent primary PCI with a filter-based distal protection device. Histopathologic analysis was performed on retrieved embolic fragments, assessing the presence and relative amount of fibrin, necrosis, lipid droplets, collagen, mucopolysaccharides, and leukocytes, {{as well as the}} total debris volume. Such variables were related to baseline clinical and angiographic variables. Results Embolic material was recovered in 41 (89 %) of 46 cases, with a mean total debris volume of 1. 2 +/- 2. 2 mm(3) Prevalent histopathologic patterns were organized thrombus (47 %),. fresh thrombus (29 %), and plaque fragments (24 %). At multivariate analysis, none of the baseline clinical variables considered significantly predicted the total debris volume. Among angiographic variables, angiographic signs of <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (cut-off coronary occlusion pattern or large intracoronary minus image) independently predicted the total debris volume at multivariate analysis, (odds ratio 15. 8, P. 20), or its qualitative composition.

Background: Thrombectomy aims at reducing distal thrombotic embolization during pPCI, improving myocardial reperfusion and clinical outcome. Methods: We randomized 208 patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio to either pPCI with thrombectomy (Group T) or standard pPCI (Group S). Thrombectomy was performed with either rheolytic or manual aspiration catheters. Three-month magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess infarct size and transmurality and microvascular obstruction (MVO). The primary endpoints were ST-segment elevation resolution (STR) > 70 % at 60 min and 3 -month infarct size. Results: The baseline profile was similar between groups, except for a higher rate of initial Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 in Group S (p = 0. 002). Group T showed a significantly higher rate of STR (57. 4 % vs. 37. 3 %; p = 0. 004) and of final myocardial blush 3 (68. 3 % vs. 52. 9 %; p = 0. 03). Group T and Group S did not differ with regard to infarct size (20. 4 ± 10. 5 % vs. 19. 3 ± 10. 6 %; p = 0. 54) and transmurality (11. 9 ± 12. 0 % vs. 11. 6 ± 12. 7 %; p = 0. 92), but Group T showed significantly less MVO (11. 4 % vs. 26. 7 %; p = 0. 02) and a higher prevalence of inhomogeneous scar (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND—: Thrombus {{aspiration}} during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for {{the treatment}} of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with STEMI. METHODS—: Included were large (N≥ 1000) randomized controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy vs. PCI alone in patients with STEMI. Individual patient data was provided by the leadership of each trial. The pre-specified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular (CV) mortality within 30 days and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 30 days. RESULTS—: The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS, TASTE and TOTAL) enrolled 19, 047 patients, of whom 18, 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. CV death at 30 days occurred in 221 (2. 4 %) of 9155 patients randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 (2. 9 %) of 9151 randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 01, p= 0. 06). Stroke or TIA occurred in 66 (0. 8 %) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0. 5 %) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio [OR] 1. 43 95 % CI 0. 98 - 2. 1, p= 0. 06). There {{were no significant differences in}} recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (TIMI thrombus grade ≥ 3) thrombus aspiration was associated with less CV death (170 [2. 5 %] vs. 205 [3. 1 %] HR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 98, p = 0. 03), and with more stroke or TIA (55 [0. 9 %] vs. 34 [0. 5 %] OR 1. 56; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 42, p= 0. 04).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{evaluation}} of treatment strategies for {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) is assessed {{through the use of}} a reliable method of quantifying the extent of the thrombotic process. Previous indices of <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> have suffered from various limitations, including lack of clinical relevance, poor correlation with actual thrombus mass, and failure to include important venous segments in the methodology. The use of a novel scheme of quantifying venous thrombus was evaluated as an alternative method that would avoid some of the drawbacks of existing indices. Methods: The volumes of 14 venous segments (infrarenal inferior vena cava, common iliac, hypogastric, external iliac, common femoral, profunda, superficial femoral, and popliteal and six tibial veins) were calculated from computed tomography (pelvic vein diameter), duplex ultrasound scan (infrainguinal vein diameter), and contrast venography (length of all segments) measurements. A venous volumetric index (VVI) was assigned with the normalization of the values to the volume of a single calf vein. The VVI was validated with the assessment of the ability to discriminate between asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT and between those DVT that were associated with pulmonary emboli and those that were not. Results: With the imaging data, the VVI ranged from 1 for a single calf vein thrombus to 26 for the infrarenal inferior vena cava. Each VVI unit represented 2. 3 mL of thrombus, with a maximum possible score of 63 representing a <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> of 145 mL for a single extremity, including the infrarenal inferior vena cava. In 885 patients with DVT, the VVI ranged from 1 to 56, averaging 3. 9 ± 0. 2 in patients who were asymptomatic and 8. 7 ± 0. 3 in patients who were symptomatic (P <. 001). The VVI was similar in the patients with pulmonary emboli as compared with those without (9. 6 ± 1. 2 vs 7. 7 ± 0. 2, respectively). In comparison with the three existing methods of quantifying venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results suggested that the VVI and the Venous Registry index were better than the other two indices in the discrimination of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic DVT (P <. 001). Conclusion: A novel index of venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> on the basis of actual venous volume measurements, was more accurate than present indices in the differentiation between clinical categories of patients with DVT.

The aim of our study was to investigate clinical predictors for insufficient reperfusion in patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> treated with PPCI and manual aspiration thrombectomy. Methods. From January 2011 till December 2015, 277 STEMI patients undergoing manual aspiration thrombectomy and PPCI were selected and 202 patients with a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade 4 ~ 5 were eventually involved in our study. According to a cTFC value, patients were divided into Group I (cTFC > 40), namely, insufficient reperfusion group; Group II (cTFC ≤ 40), namely, sufficient reperfusion group. Results. Univariate analysis showed that hypertension, multivessel disease, time from symptom to PCI (≧ 4. 8 hours), and postaspiration cTFC > 40 were negative predictors for insufficient reperfusion.

Methods and results Clinical and angiographic characteristics were prospectively assessed in 400 consecutive patients who underwent p-PCI, in order to identify predictors of DE. The impact of DE on Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow, myocardial blush, and troponin I (TnI) was assessed according to symptom onset-to-balloon time. DE occurred in 64 (16 %) patients and did not change with time-to-treatment (P = 0. 87). The occlusion pattern of infarct-related artery (IRA), treatment of right coronary artery, higher TIMI thrombus score, longer lesion, and large IRA diameter were predictors of DE. The rate of TIMI 0 / 1 and myocardial blush 0 / 1 was higher in patients exhibiting DE when time-to-treatment was ≤ 6 h (P < 0. 0001), while TnI was higher in patients with DE when time-to-treatment was < 3 h.

RESULTS: Three studies directly comparing (2 RCTs and 1 non-randomized; N = 513) and 21 RCTs (N = 4514) indirectly comparing the two strategies {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. The direct meta-analysis showed comparable rates of survival (p = 0. 88), re-infarction (MI) (p = 0. 84) and procedural outcomes between the two strategies; direct evidence was however limited in number of enrolled patients. The indirect meta-analysis showed a superior reduction in mortality with manual thrombectomy compared to mechanical thrombectomy in the overall analysis (p = 0. 01); by excluding trials with low percentage of patients with intracoronary thrombus (< 50 %) at baseline, the two strategies were comparable in survival, but mechanical thrombectomy was associated with a significant reduction in re-MI (p < 0. 001) and stroke (p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis lends support to mechanical thrombectomy in the population with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> only where, compared to manual thrombectomy, it is likely to provide higher benefits...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To compare {{angiographic}} {{and optical}} coherence tomography (OCT) data pertinent to thrombi, along with the histologic characteristics of aspirated thrombi in patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with or without inflammation, as assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Methods: In the OCTAVIA (Optical Coherence Tomography Assessment of Gender Diversity in Primary Angioplasty) study, 140 patients with STEMI referred for primary percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The patients underwent OCT assessment of the culprit vessel, along with blood sampling of CRP and MPO, and histologic analysis of the thrombus. Results: Biomarkers were available for 129 patients, and histology and immunohistochemistry of the thrombi were available for 78 patients. Comparisons were made using the median thresholds of CRP and MPO (2. 08 mg/L and 604. 124 ng/mL, respectively). There was no correlation between CRP and MPO levels in the whole population (p = 0. 685). Patients with high CRP levels had <b>higher</b> <b>thrombus</b> grades and more frequent TIMI flow 0 / 1 compared with those with low CRP levels (5 [1 st quartile 3; 3 rd quartile 5] vs. 3. 5 mg/L [1; 5], p = 0. 007, and 69. 3 vs. 48. 5 %, p = 0. 04, respectively). Patients with high MPO levels more commonly had early thrombi than had those with low MPO levels (42. 5 vs. 20. 0 %, p = 0. 04). Conclusions: CRP and MPO were not correlated in STEMI patients, possibly reflecting different pathogenic mechanisms, with CRP more related to <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> and MPO to thrombus age...|$|R
40|$|Despite anticoagulation therapy, up to {{one-half}} {{of patients with}} deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will develop the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Improving the long-term outcome of DVT patients at risk for PTS will therefore require new approaches. Here we investigate the effects of statins [...] lipid-lowering agents with anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties [...] in decreasing <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> and decreasing vein wall injury, mediators of PTS, in established murine stasis and non-stasis chemical-induced venous thrombosis (N = 282 mice). Treatment of mice with daily atorvastatin or rosuvastatin significantly reduced stasis venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> by 25 % without affecting lipid levels, blood coagulation parameters, or blood cell counts. Statin-driven reductions in VT <b>burden</b> (<b>thrombus</b> mass for stasis thrombi, intravital microscopy thrombus area for non-stasis thrombi) compared similarly to the therapeutic anticoagulant effects of low molecular weight heparin. Blood from statin-treated mice showed significant reductions in platelet aggregation and clot stability. Statins additionally reduced thrombus plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), tissue factor, neutrophils, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and macrophages, and these effects were most notable in the earlier timepoints after DVT formation. In addition, statins reduced DVT-induced vein wall scarring by 50 % durably up to day 21 in stasis VT, as shown by polarized light microscopy of picrosirius red-stained vein wall collagen. The overall results demonstrate that statins improve VT resolution via profibrinolytic, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and anti-vein wall scarring effects. Statins may therefore offer a new pharmacotherapeutic approach to improve DVT resolution and to reduce the post-thrombotic syndrome, particularly in subjects who are ineligible for anticoagulation therapy...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Stent {{thrombosis}} (ST) is {{a recognized}} complication of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Due to the <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> present in ST, {{the use of}} thrombus aspiration (TA) may enhance the angiographic results by limiting distal embolization. Methods. Consecutive patients undergoing urgent PCI due to ST were studied, consisting of two groups according {{to the type of}} intervention (standard PCI [SP] or TA). TIMI flow, corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), myocardial blush grade (MBG), thrombus score (TS), Yip's adverse thrombus burden features, occurrence of angiographically evident distal embolization (DE) were evaluated offline. In-hospital outcomes were also recorded. Results. Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Baseline clinical and angiographic features were similar between patients treated by SP (n = 12) and those treated by TA (n = 16). After PCI, a trend in favor of TA as compared to SP was observed for post-PCI TIMI 3 flow rate (67 % VS. 89 %;p = 0. 10), final cTFC (31 +/- 35 vs. 17 +/- 21; p = 0. 10) and MBG 2 - 3 rote (40 % vs. 67 %; p = 0. 12). Accordingly, the rate of adverse angiographic outcome (post-PCI TIMI 0 - 1 flow and/or DE) was significantly lower in the TA as compared to SP: 5 % (1 / 18) vs 33 % (5 / 15) respectively (p = 0. 04). Throughout hospitalization, major adverse events occurred in 6 % of TA patients vs. 33 % of SP patients (p = 0. 08). Conclusions. TA in patients with ST is safe and is associated with better angiographic outcomes compared to standard PCI. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these early observations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Primary PCI is the {{preferred}} modality to restore blood perfusion in STEMI patients, but myocardial reperfusion is sometimes lower than optimal. Distal embolization seems to play the leading role. There is rare evidence suggestive of M-Guard stents; a recent innovation which protects against distal embolization may be beneficial in this circumstance. Materials and Methods:This was a prospective single arm study. Patients with acute STEMI admitted at the Cardiac Emergency Unit of Imam Reza Hospital from July 2011 to November  2012 who had a large bulk of thrombus in their angiogram, underwent M-Guard stenting and were followed up for six months for chest pain and secondary revascularization. Results: The 23 patients, aged between 34 and 84; 65. 2 %, were male and had undergone primary PCI, mechanical thrombus aspiration, and M-Guard stenting. Left Anterior Descending (LAD) (63. 9 %) and Right Coronary Artery (RCA) (39. 1 %) were most commonly involved. 78. 2 %, 13. 1 %, and 8. 9 % of patients had primary Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Thrombus grade five, four, and three. Among them, 86. 9 % achieved TIMI Flow grade three and 13. 04 % TIMI Flow grade two. The rate of transient "no-reflow" phenomenon was 21 %. One patient died after stenting {{in the setting of}} cardiogenic shock. There was one case of in-stent restenosis five months after the procedure. Of the other 15 accessible patients, after six months, none experienced a second angioplasty or any ischemic symptoms. Conclusion: Using M-Guard stents in acute STEMI patients having undergone primary PCI with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> is probably associated with lower rates of the "no-reflow" phenomenon and improved vessel reperfusion. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that erythrocytes are a potential component in atheromatous lesions and thrombus formation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the associations of red blood cell (RBC) component of coronary thrombi with oxidative stress and myocardial reperfusion. Aspirated thrombi from 178 STEMI patients within 12 h of symptom onset were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies against platelets, RBCs, fibrin, macrophages, and neutrophils [myeloperoxidase (MPO) ]. The thrombi were divided into tertiles according to the percentage of glycophorin-A-positive area: low (glycophorin-A-positive area 33; n 60), intermediate (54 to 33; n 59), and high group (epsilon 54; n 59). We also measured plasma MPO levels on admission. In the thrombi, the number of MPO-positive cells in the high-RBC group was significantly greater than that in the low-RBC group (high, 927 385; intermediate, 765 406; low, 279 220 cells/mm(2); P 0. 0001). Plasma MPO levels were significantly higher in the high-RBC group than that in the low-RBC group [low 43. 1 (25. 071. 6); intermediate 71. 0 (32. 9111. 2); high 74. 3 (31. 1126. 4) ng/mL; P 0. 005]. Distal embolization occurred more frequently in the high-RBC group (P 0. 0009). Moreover, the signs of impaired myocardial reperfusion, as indicated by incomplete ST-segment resolution (STR) and lower myocardial blush grades (MBG), and progression of left ventricular remodelling at 6 months were frequently observed in the high-RBC group (high vs. low: STR, P 0. 056; MBG, P 0. 01; remodelling, P 0. 01). The present study demonstrated that erythrocyte-rich thrombi contain more inflammatory cells and reflect <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> leading to impaired myocardial reperfusion in STEMI patient...|$|E
