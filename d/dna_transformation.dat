5000|$|Genetic {{transformation}} {{is the process}} by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient’s genome by homologous recombination. In Neisseria meningitides, <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> requires the presence of short DNA uptake sequences (DUSs) which are 9-10mers residing in coding regions of the donor DNA. Specific recognition of DUSs is mediated by a type IV pilin, ComP. [...] Menningococcal type IV pili bind DNA through the minor pilin ComP via an electropositive stripe that is predicted to be exposed on the filament's surface. ComP displays an exquisite binding preference for selective DUSs. The distribution of DUSs within the N. meningitides genome favors certain genes, suggesting that there is a bias for genes involved in genomic maintenance and repair.|$|E
40|$|Competent and noncompetent {{bacteria}} {{are able to}} bind deoxyribonucleate (DNA). The consequence of this binding is different for {{the two types of}} bacteria. Competent {{bacteria are}} able to utilize the <b>DNA</b> for <b>transformation.</b> <b>DNA</b> exposed to noncompetent bacteria loses its biological activity with a coincident reduction in the double-stranded molecular weight. The reduction in molecular weight {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to account for the loss of biological activity observed...|$|R
50|$|Since URA3 {{allows for}} both {{positive}} and negative selection, it has been developed as a genetic marker for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformations</b> and other genetic techniques in bacteria and many fungal species. It {{is one of the most}} important genetic markers in yeast genetic modification. While URA3 is a powerful selectable marker it has a high background. This background is because cells that pick up mutations in URA3 may also grow on 5-FOA. Colonies should be verified by a second assay such as PCR to confirm the desired strain has been created.|$|R

50|$|Different {{species of}} {{bacteria}} in this genus {{can be identified}} using fluorescence-lactose-denitrification to find the amount of acid produced by metabolism of glucose. The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan auxotrophic mutant of Acinetobacter baylyi (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative Acinetobacter isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an Acinetobacter minimal agar (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate {{as a member of}} the genus Acinetobacter. E. coli HB101 and A. calcoaceticus MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Protoplasts {{are widely}} used for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> (for making genetically {{modified}} organisms), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell. In the case of plant cells, protoplasts may be regenerated into whole plants first by growing into a group of plant cells that develops into a callus and then by regeneration of shoots (caulogenesis) from the callus using plant tissue culture methods. Growth of protoplasts into callus and regeneration of shoots requires the proper balance of plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium that must be customized for each species of plant. Unlike protoplasts from vascular plants, protoplasts from mosses, such as Physcomitrella patens, do not need phytohormones for regeneration, nor do they form a callus during regeneration. Instead, they regenerate directly into the filamentous protonema, mimicking a germinating moss spore.|$|E
50|$|Among other genetic information, the F-plasmid {{carries a}} tra and trb locus, which {{together}} are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 genes. The tra locus includes the pilin gene and regulatory genes, which together form pili {{on the cell}} surface. The locus also includes the genes for the proteins that attach themselves {{to the surface of}} F− bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact, but then are denatured with SDS and yet <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> still proceeds. Several proteins coded for in the tra or trb locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located {{at the base of the}} pilus, initiates membrane fusion.|$|E
40|$|DNA {{matching}} is a computationally demanding task. The Human Genome Project {{is producing}} huge quantities of data, which {{have to be}} analyzed. A formal description of the task of searching a DNA sequence is given and an efficient parallel algorithm is derived using formal methods. The algorithm is implemented on an FPGA using Handel-C, a language that enables the compilation of high-level algorithms directly into gate level synchronous hardware, thus reducing the development time. The designed algorithm makes no assumptions about <b>DNA</b> <b>transformations,</b> and is therefore a very powerful tool. It {{can be used in}} conjunction with an expert system to automatically detect patterns of interest in the DNA...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} optimization of {{a transformation}} {{system for the}} halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. Transformation of spheroplasts {{in the presence of}} polyethylene glycol permits the uptake and expression of high-molecular-weight linear fragments of genomic DNA as well as plasmid or bacteriophage <b>DNA.</b> <b>Transformations</b> can be performed with either fresh or frozen cell preparations. Auxotrophic mutants were transformed to prototrophy with genomic DNA from wild-type cells with efficiencies of 5 x 10 (4) /micrograms of DNA and frequencies of 8 x 10 (- 5) per regenerated spheroplast. The overall efficiency of <b>transformation</b> with genomic <b>DNA</b> implies that genetic recombination is an efficient process in H. volcanii...|$|R
40|$|Industrially useful {{polyploid}} yeasts {{such as the}} brewing yeasts do {{not possess}} any auxotrophic genetic markers and hence are not easily amenable to plasmid-mediated <b>DNA</b> <b>transformations.</b> In an attempt to obtain genetic markers, a number of useful Saccharomyces sp. strains and some amylolytic Schwanniomyces sp. strains were tested for their susceptibility to the antibiotic Geneticin G 418, a 2 -deoxystreptamine reported to be active against bacteria, yeasts, and plant and animal cells. All of the Saccharomyces sp. strains, including the brewing strains, {{were found to be}} susceptible to G 418 in the concentration range of 150 to 500 micrograms/ml. Of the three Schwanniomyces species investigated, only Schwanniomyces castellii (strain 1402) was found to be resistant to G 418 at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml. Resistance was exhibited both in liquid media and on glycerol-peptone-yeast extract agar plates. This finding is interesting in view of the possibility of using this strain as a <b>DNA</b> donor for <b>transformations</b> aimed at introducing the amylolytic capability into brewing yeasts...|$|R

50|$|As well as {{manipulating}} the DNA, techniques {{had to be}} developed for its insertion (known as transformation) into an organism's genome. Griffiths experiment had already shown that some bacteria {{had the ability to}} naturally take up and express foreign DNA. Artificial competence was induced in Escherichia coli in 1970 when Morton Mandel and Akiko Higa showed that it could take up bacteriophage λ after treatment with calcium chloride solution (CaCl2). Two years later, Stanley Cohen showed that CaCl2 treatment was also effective for uptake of plasmid <b>DNA.</b> <b>Transformation</b> using electroporation was developed in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency and bacterial range. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, as a host for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformations.</b> The system {{is based on}} an auxotrophic mutant host of P. pastoris which is defective in histidinol dehydrogenase. As a selectable marker, we isolated and characterized the P. pastoris HIS 4 gene. Plasmid vectors which contained either the P. pastoris or the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS 4 gene transformed the P. pastoris mutant host. DNA transfer was accomplished by {{a modified version of the}} spheroplast generation (CaCl 2 -polyethylene glycol) -fusion procedure developed for S. cerevisiae. In addition, we report the isolation and characterization of P. pastoris DNA fragments with autonomous replication sequence activity. Two fragments, PARS 1 and PARS 2, when present on plasmids increased transformation frequencies to 10 (5) /micrograms and maintained the plasmids as autonomous elements in P. pastoris cells...|$|R

The neomycin resistance gene from Escherichia coli transposon Tn 5, which codes for the enzyme phosphotransferase and confers resistance to the antibiotic G 418, was ligated into macronuclear `gene-size' DNA molecules. Using this recombinant <b>DNA</b> for <b>transformation</b> experiments we show that the gene is replicated and expressed in transformed cells...|$|R
5000|$|Genetic {{transformation}} {{is the process}} by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient’s genome by recombination. In N. meningitides and N. gonorrhoeae, <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9-10 monomers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of DUSs is mediated by a type IV pilin. [...] Davidsen et al. reported that in N. meningitides and N. gonorrhoeae, DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. These authors proposed that the over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell. Caugant and Maiden noted that the distribution of DUS is consistent with recombination being primarily a mechanism for genome repair that can occasionally result in generation of diversity, which even more occasionally, is adaptive. [...] It was also suggested by Michod et al. that an important benefit of transformation in N. gonorrhoeae is recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages caused by oxidative attack by the host’s phagocytic cells.|$|E
40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae is {{naturally}} competent for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation.</b> Under most conditions encountered in vivo, gonococci express {{one or more}} opacity (Opa) proteins on their surfaces. Recently, it was shown that DNA preferentially binds to the surfaces of Opa-expressing organisms compared to those of isogenic Opa-negative strains, presumably due to the numerous cationic residues in the predicted surface-exposed loops of the Opa protein. This study examined whether Opa-DNA interactions actually influence <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> of the gonococcus. The data show that Opa-expressing gonococci are more efficient recipients of DNA for transformation and {{are more susceptible to}} exogenous DNase I treatment at early stages during the <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> process than non-Opa expressors. Furthermore, inhibition of the transformation process was demonstrable for Opa+ populations when either nonspecific DNA or the polyanion heparin was used. Overall, the data suggest that Opa expression, with its presumptive positive surface charge contribution, promotes <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> by causing a more prolonged sequestration of donor DNA at the cell surface, which translates into more efficient transformation over time...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} described {{the expression of}} two pili of different lengths {{on the surface of}} Legionella pneumophila (B. J. Stone and Y. Abu Kwaik, Infect. Immun. 66 : 1768 – 1775, 1998). Production of long pili requires a functional pilEL locus, encoding a type IV pilin protein. Since type IV pili in Neisseria gonorrhoeae are associated with competence for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation,</b> we examined the competence of L. pneumophila for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> under conditions that allowed the expression of type IV pili. We show that L. pneumophila is naturally competent for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> by isogenic chromosomal DNA and by plasmid DNA containing L. pneumophila DNA. Many different L. pneumophila loci are able to transform L. pneumophila after addition of plasmid DNA, including gspA, ppa, asd, and pilEL. The transformation frequency is reduced when competing DNA containing either L. pneumophila DNA or vector sequences is added to the bacteria, suggesting that uptake-specific sequences may not be involved in DNA uptake. Competence for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> correlates with expression of the type IV pili, and a pilEL mutant defective in expression of type IV pili is not competent for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation.</b> Complementation of the mutant for competence is restored by the reintroduction of a cosmid that restores production of type IV pili. Minimal competence is restored to the mutant by introduction of pilEL alone. We conclude that competence for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> in L. pneumophila is associated with expression of the type IV pilus and results in recombination of L. pneumophila DNA into the chromosome. Since expression of type IV pili also facilitates attachment of L. pneumophila to mammalian cells and protozoa, we designated the type IV pili CAP (for competence- and adherence-associated pili) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} the alkane and fatty-acid utilizing yeast Candida tropicalis as a host for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformations.</b> The system {{is based on}} an auxotrophic mutant host of C. tropicalis which is defective in orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (ura 3). The ura 3 host was isolated by mutagenesis and a double-selection procedure that combined nystatin enrichment selection and 5 -fluoro-orotic acid resistance selection. As a selectable marker, we isolated and characterized the C. tropicalis URA 3 gene. Plasmid vectors that contained the C. tropicalis URA 3 gene transformed the C. tropicalis mutant host at a frequency of 10 (3) to 10 (4) transformants per micrograms of plasmid DNA. Vectors that contained the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA 3 gene could not transform C. tropicalis. DNA transfer was accomplished by modified versions of either spheroplast generation (CaCl 2 -polyethylene glycol) -fusion or cation (LiCl) procedures developed for S. cerevisiae. Plasmid vectors that had been cut within the C. tropicalis URA 3 fragment integrated by homologous recombination at the URA 3 locus...|$|R

40|$|African trypanosomes, such as Trypanosoma brucei, are {{protozoan}} parasites {{of mammals}} that were first described over 100 hundred years ago.

In the last decade or so, genetic manipulation of trypanosomes has become possible through <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation,</b> allowing yet more detailed analysis of the biology of the parasite. One facet of this is that <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> has itself been used as an assay for recombination and will undoubtedly lead to further genetic approaches to examine this process. Here we describe protocols for <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> of Trypanosoma brucei, including two different life cycle stages and two different strain types that are distinguished by morphological and developmental criteria. We consider the application of transformation to recombination, as well as the uses of transforming the different life cycle stages and strain types...|$|E
40|$|Competence {{stimulating}} peptide (CSP) is a 17 -amino acid peptide pheromone secreted by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Upon binding of CSP to its membrane-associated {{receptor kinase}} ComD, {{a cascade of}} signaling events is initiated, leading to activation of the competence regulon by the response regulator ComE. Genes encoding proteins {{that are involved in}} DNA uptake and transformation, as well as virulence, are upregulated. Previous studies have shown that disruption of key components in the competence regulon inhibits <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> and attenuates virulence. Thus, synthetic analogues that competitively inhibit CSPs may serve as attractive drugs to control pneumococcal infection and to reduce horizontal gene transfer during infection. We performed amino acid substitutions on conserved amino acid residues of CSP 1 in an effort to disable <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> and to attenuate the virulence of S. pneumoniae. One of the mutated peptides, CSP 1 -E 1 A, inhibited development of competence in <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> by outcompeting CSP 1 in time and concentration-dependent manners. CSP 1 -E 1 A reduced the expression of pneumococcal virulence factors choline binding protein D (CbpD) and autolysin A (LytA) in vitro, and significantly reduced mouse mortality after lung infection. Furthermore, CSP 1 -E 1 A attenuated the acquisition of an antibiotic resistance gene and a capsule gene in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that the strategy of using a peptide inhibitor is applicable to other CSP subtype, including CSP 2. CSP 1 -E 1 A and CSP 2 -E 1 A were able to cross inhibit the induction of competence and <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> in pneumococcal strains with incompatible ComD subtypes. These result...|$|E

40|$|We {{constructed}} a cloning vector {{for use in}} the plant pathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganense subsp. michiganense. The vector pDM 100 consists of a 3. 2 -kb restriction fragment of the Clavibacter plasmid pCM 1 joined to a pBR 325 derivative carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase of transposon Tn 5 and the gentamicin acetyltransferase of Tn 1696. Both antibiotic resistance genes are efficiently expressed in C. michiganense subsp. michiganense. Although polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection of spheroplasts with the DNA of the C. michiganense subsp. michiganense-specific bacteriophage CMP 1 yielded about 3 x 10 (3) transfectants per microgram of <b>DNA,</b> in <b>transformations</b> with plasmid <b>DNA</b> only a very few transformants were obtained. However, the transformation efficiency could be improved by electroporation of intact cells, giving about 2 x 10 (3) transformants per microgram of plasmid <b>DNA.</b> Since a <b>transformation</b> procedure and a cloning vector are now available, pathogenicity in C. michiganense subsp. michiganense can now be analyzed genetically...|$|R

40|$|A vector, called pWreckl, was {{constructed}} for the direct <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> of N. tabacum protoplasts. This vector {{was shown to}} confer kanamycin resistance to transformed callus. Using derivatives of this plasmid containing various reporter genes, a protocol for direct <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> by PEG-mediated uptake was established. However, all attempts to obtain transformed callus by electroporation were unsuccessful. The CAB 6 gene from N. tabacum {{was identified as a}} suitable candidate for gene targeting and was further manipulated to produce constructs in pWreckl which were used in gene targeting experiments. Using a derivative of pWreckl, called BinsupF, transformed tobacco plants were generated and used as a model system for the rescue of integrated sequences by supF selection. This system was found to be capable of rescuing integrated pWreckl sequences, but at an efficiency below that which would be required for the rescue of rare gene targeting events. Therefore a second protocol was developed which used the technique of polymerase chain amplification to amplify specific integration events. Following direct <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> with a pWreckl. CAB 6 construct, a number of possible gene targeting events were identified and subcloned into pUC 13. Partial sequencing of these clones revealed that they were not the result of homologous recombination, but arose through a combination of plasmid degradation and rearrangement which appeared to precede the actual integration event...|$|E
40|$|The oral biofilm {{organism}} Streptococcus mutans {{must face}} numerous environmental stresses {{to survive in}} its natural habitat. Under specific stresses, S. mutans expresses the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) pher-omone known to induce autolysis and facilitate the uptake and incorporation of exogenous DNA, a process called <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation.</b> We have previously demonstrated that the CSP-induced CipB bacteriocin (mu-tacin V) {{is a major factor}} involved in both cellular processes. Our objective in this work was to characterize the role of CipB bacteriocin during <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation.</b> Although other bacteriocin mutants were impaired in their ability to acquire DNA under CSP-induced conditions, the cipB mutant was the only mutant showing a sharp decrease in transformation efficiency. The autolysis function of CipB bacteriocin does not participate in the <b>DNA</b> <b>transformation</b> process, as factors released via lysis of a subpopulation of cells did not {{contribute to the development of}} genetic competence in the surviving population. Moreover, CipB does not seem to participate in membrane depolarization to assist passage of DNA. Microarray-based expression profiling showed that under CSP-induced conditions, CipB regulated 130 genes, among which are the comDE locus and comR and comX genes, encoding critical factors that influence competency development in S. mutans.
