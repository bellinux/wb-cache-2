Judging {{on these}} principles, {{velocity}} of discharge {{through the same}} wire may be varied greatly by attending to the circumstances which cause variations of discharge through spermaceti or sulphur. Thus, for instance, it must vary with the tension or intensity of the first urging force (1234. 1240.), which tension is charge and induction. So if the two ends of the wire, in Professor Wheatstone's experiment, were immediately connected with two large insulated metallic surfaces exposed to the air, so that the primary act of induction, after making the contact for discharge, might be in part removed from the <b>internal</b> <b>portion</b> of the wire at the first instant, and disposed for the moment on its surface jointly with the air and surrounding conductors, then I venture to anticipate that the middle spark would be more retarded than before; and if these two plates were {{the inner and outer}} coating of a large jar or a Leyden battery, then the retardation of that spark would be still greater.|$|E

Inducing residual compressive stresses into materials can also increase their resistance to stress corrosion cracking; that is, non-mechanically-assisted cracking that occurs when a material is placed in a corrosive environment in the presence of tensile stress. The technique is commonly used in manufacture of high-pressure pump cylinders, warship and tank gun barrels, and fuel injection systems for diesel engines. While autofrettage will induce some work hardening, that is not the primary mechanism of strengthening.|$|R

40|$|Sequence {{evolution}} of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in retrotransposons belonging to the Ty 1 -copia class was studied in 11 plant species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of RT sequences indicated a strong pattern of purifying selection, manifested as high ratios of third to first plus second codon position substitutions, and low ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, especially in <b>internal</b> <b>portions</b> of the element phylogenies. Evidence of purifying selection was most pronounced in plant species with low estimated copy numbers of Ty 1 -copia elements.

5000|$|Symptoms of R. stolonifer {{infection}} of sweet potatoes include rapid {{development of a}} watery soft rot of the <b>internal</b> <b>portion</b> of the storage root with the periderm generally remaining intact. Infection can occur anywhere on the root but usually initiates at the ends due to the inevitable wounding resulting from harvest, or because a root's tapered ends {{are more likely to}} be injured. Rhizopus soft rot produces a characteristic fermentation odor. [...] Roots may dry and mummify with only the periderm and root fibers remaining intact because of the inability of the fungus to break down the lignin in these components. Characteristic signs of Rhizopus soft rot include the production of tufts of white hyphae which break through the surface of the root and produce large numbers of brown-black sporangiophores (34 µm diam. by 1000-3500 µm length) which support a sporangium (100-350 µm diam.). Sporangiospores (4-11 µm diam) are produced in the sporangium and are unicellular, ovoid and brown. Sporangiospores serve as the primary [...] and are passively released when the outer layer of the sporangium breaks down. Other R. stolonifer structures include stolons and rhizoids.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of methimazole-induced hypothyroidism on the vascularization and immune cells infiltration into islets. A general observation of pancreas was also done. Twelve Chinchilla-breed female adult rabbits were divided into control n= 6 and hypothyroid groups (n= 6, methimazole, 0. 02 % in drinking water for 30 days).

40|$|Outbreaks of {{hospital}} infections caused by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains are of increasing concern worldwide. Although {{it has been}} reported that particular outbreak strains are geographically widespread, little is known about the diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of A. baumannii clonal groups. Sequencing of <b>internal</b> <b>portions</b> of seven housekeeping genes (total 2, 976 nt) was performed in 154 A. baumannii strains covering the breadth of known diversity and including representatives of previously recognized international clones, and in 19 representatives of other Acinetobacter species. Restricted amounts of diversity and a star-like phylogeny reveal that A. baumannii is a genetically compact species that suffered a severe bottleneck in the recent past, possibly linked to a restricted ecological niche. A. baumannii is neatly demarcated from its closest relative (genomic species 13 TU) and other Acinetobacter species. Multilocus sequence typing analysis demonstrated that the previously recognized international clones I to III correspond to three clonal complexes, each made of a central, predominant genotype and few single locus variants, a hallmark of recent clonal expansion. Whereas antimicrobial resistance was almost universal among isolates of these and a novel international clone (ST 15), isolates of the other genotypes were mostly susceptible. This dichotomy indicates that antimicrobial resistance is a major selective advantage that drives the ongoing rapid clonal expansion of these highly problematic agents of nosocomia...|$|R
40|$|The {{throat and}} {{skin of the}} human host are the {{principal}} reservoirs for the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. The emm locus encodes structurally heterogeneous surface fibrils that play numerous roles in virulence, depending on the strain. Isolates harboring the emm pattern A-C marker exhibit a strong tendency to cause throat infection, whereas emm pattern D strains are usually recovered from impetigo lesions; as a group, emm pattern E organisms fail to display obvious tissue tropisms. The peak incidence for streptococcal pharyngitis and impetigo varies with season and locale, leading to wide spatial and temporal distances between throat and skin strains. To assess any impact of niche separation on genetic variation, the extent of recombinational exchange between emm pattern A-C, D, and E subpopulations was evaluated. Analysis of nucleotide sequence data for <b>internal</b> <b>portions</b> of seven housekeeping loci from 212 isolates provides evidence of extensive recombination between strains belonging to different emm pattern subpopulations. Furthermore, no fixed nucleotide {{differences were found between}} emm pattern A-C and D strains. Thus, despite some niche separation created by distinct epidemiological trends and innate tissue tropisms there is little evidence for neutral gene divergence between throat and skin strains. Maintenance of a relationship between emm pattern and tissue tropism in the face of underlying recombination suggests that tissue tropism is associated with emm or a closely linked gene...|$|R

Thus, this study describes {{for the first time}} morphological aspects of lava flows and structural characteristics caused by lava-sediment interaction in the northwestern PCFB province (NW-PCFB). Early Cretaceous (134 to 132 Ma) tholeiitic rocks of the PCFB were emplaced on a large intracratonic Paleozoic sedimentary basin (Parana Basin), mainly covering dry eolian sandstones (Botucatu Formation). As this sedimentary unit is overlain by the basic lava flows of the PCFB, the interaction of lavas and unconsolidated sediments resulted in the generation of fluidal peperites. This aspect is significant because it shows that restricted wet environments should have existed in the Botucatu desert. The peperite zones of the NW-PCFB are associated with compound pahoehoe-type (P-type) flows and are always related to the first volcanic pulses. These flows have dispersed vesicles and sand-filled cracks in their base and top borders, as well as the presence of interlayered sandstones with irregular contacts and varied thicknesses.
