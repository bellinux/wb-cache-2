5|$|Haphazard <b>industrial</b> <b>planning,</b> {{increased}} urbanisation, {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} following World War II the plateau remained agricultural. Primary industry, almost entirely agriculture, accounted for 63% of economic activity, secondary accounted for 12%, and tertiary 25%. Post-war <b>industrial</b> <b>planning</b> resulted in large-scale development of coastal {{areas on the}} eastern Shimōsa Plateau along Tokyo Bay. Fishing and agricultural areas along the bay were replaced by landfill. The scenery of the eastern plateau went from largely agricultural to a vast area of factory smokestacks and high-rise housing. The development of sprawling port facilities, originally centered on the city of Chiba, culminated {{in the establishment of}} Keiyō Industrial Zone. Manufacturing facilities were developed across the central Shimōsa Plateau in the same period.|$|E
25|$|The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a {{tributary}} of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is the most contaminated river basin in Argentina and {{considered one of the most}} polluted water bodies in the world. Pollution levels in Buenos Aires’ rivers are so high that they have been considered “open sewers”, making pollution the greatest environmental risk for the metropolitan area. Pollution levels have increased steadily as urbanization and industrial growth have continuously increased in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. It is estimated that more than 4,000 industrial facilities are located in the lower and middle sections of the basin. Almost all of these industries discharge untreated effluents into the drainage system or directly into the MR River. In addition to high levels of organic pollution, these discharges contribute toxic contaminants such as heavy metals from petrochemical industries, tanneries, and meat processing facilities. More specifically, the Riacheuleo has levels of Lead, Zinc and Chrome 50 times higher than the legal limit in Argentina; 25% is from industrial sewage and waste, while the remaining 75% originates from domestic sources. The sudden onset of environmental and social degradation of the MR basin has resulted from limited investment in public infrastructure, poor environmental management, lack of adequate urban and <b>industrial</b> <b>planning,</b> and limited public infrastructure investment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> {{marketing}} <b>planning</b> is {{a typical}} example of an unstructured decision making problem due to {{the large number of}} variables to consider and the uncertainty imposed on those variables. Although abundant studies identified barriers and facilitators of effective <b>industrial</b> marketing <b>planning</b> in practice, the literature still lacks practical tools and methods that marketing managers can use for the task. This paper applies fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) to <b>industrial</b> marketing <b>planning.</b> In particular, agent based inference method is proposed to overcome dynamic relationships, time lags, and reusability issues of FCM evaluation. MACOM simulator also is developed to help marketing managers conduct what-if scenarios to see the impacts of possible changes on the variables defined in an FCM that represents <b>industrial</b> marketing <b>planning</b> problem. The simulator is applied to an <b>industrial</b> marketing <b>planning</b> problem for a global software service company in South Korea. This study has practical implication as it supports marketing managers for <b>industrial</b> marketing <b>planning</b> that has large number of variables and their cause–effect relationships. It also contributes to FCM theory by providing an agent based method for the inference of FCM. Finally, MACOM also provides academics in the industrial marketing management discipline with a tool for developing and pre-verifying a conceptual model based on qualitative knowledge of marketing practitioners...|$|R
