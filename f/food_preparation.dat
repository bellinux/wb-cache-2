40|$|ABSTRACT Carrot {{greens are}} the most under-exploited class of greens despite of high {{nutritional}} value. In daily diet an increased intake of these inexpensive greens {{can be one of}} the strategies for improving the nutritional status. Keeping this in view, the present study was undertaken with the objective to develop commonly consumed <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> by separately incorporating fresh and dry carrot greens, applying different cooking methods. Levels of incorporation of fresh carrot greens in different <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> ranged 40 to 80 per cent whereas powder of dry carrot greens was added in different preparations at 7, 8 and 9 per cent levels. Organoleptic evaluation of all <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> were conducted by a panel of ten judges using Hopkin’s seven point scale. In fresh carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> the maximum and most acceptable level (80 %) of incorporation of under exploited carrot greens was in saag and minimum (40 %) in puri and kadhi. In dry carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> the most and best level (9 %) of incorporation of greens was in mathri and minimum (7 %) in matrey. Among all the fresh carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> gulabjamun scored highest (6. 96 + 0. 27) overall acceptability scores while laddoo scored minimum (5. 52 + 0. 68). In dry carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> tacques scored highest (6. 31 + 0. 28) and laddoo scored minimum (5. 98 + 0. 69) overall acceptability scores. Beta carotene content in all <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> increased significantly (P< 0. 01) with incorporation of fresh as well as dry carrot greens...|$|R

5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In <b>food</b> <b>preparation,</b> microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E

5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} colonies can be culturally {{divided between}} the uplands and the lowlands, and this distinction is seen in diet and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> in the two regions. The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions of pork. Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it {{was used in the}} preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E

5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
5|$|Supernatural forces pervaded Maya life, and {{influenced}} {{every aspect}} {{of it from the}} simplest day-to-day activities such as <b>food</b> <b>preparation,</b> to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible. The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, music, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The central {{highlands}} of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, called Altiplano Cundiboyacense was inhabited by indigenous groups from 12,500 BP, as evidenced from archaeological finds at rock shelter El Abra, presently part of Zipaquirá. The first human occupation consisted of hunter-gatherers who foraged {{in the valleys}} and mountains of the Andean high plateau. Settlement in the early millennia of this Andean preceramic age was mainly restricted to caves and rock shelters, such as Tequendama in present-day Soacha, Piedras del Tunjo in Facatativá and Checua that currently {{is part of the}} municipality Nemocón. Around 3000 BC, the inhabitants of the Andean plains started to live in open space areas and constructed primitive circular houses where they elaborated the stone tools used for hunting, fishing, <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and primitive art, mostly rock art. The type site for this transition is the archaeological site Aguazuque, in the northwest of Soacha, close to Bogotá.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{possibility}} to use standard morphologically-based techniques to assess the tissue composition of typical meat-based <b>food</b> <b>preparations.</b> Twenty-six different types of meat-based products were randomly selected and histologically analyzed. A variety of tissues were identified including connective tissue, blood vessels, peripheral nerve, adipose tissue, glandular tissue, skin, bone and cartilage and plant material. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining was also {{used to evaluate the}} presence of brain tissue. The results obtained suggest that most of the analyzed products display a more complex composition than the one suggested by package label.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{efficiency}} the <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> {{in junior high school}} home economics education, the dishes including the local dishes were selected. The local dishes selected for the <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> had to be made of daily available food and involve curriculum-based cooking processes so that students could learn cooking techniques and understand the nutritional and cooking properties of daily food. Upon selection, students' attitude to local dishes was investigated, and other popular dishes were additionally listed to balance with local dishes. The survey results indicated that students interested in eating were more willing to learn cooking the local dishes and pass down the tradition for generations than those not interested in eating. Students who cook more often showed a higher awareness of the local dishes and a greater willingness for cooking them. These results suggest that <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> could be highly effective for teaching local dishes to junior-high school students. Ultimately, broiled sardine in Kabayaki sauce, Hamburg steak, and greens dressed in sesame sauce were selected as popular dishes that enhance students' understanding of the cooking properties of daily food as required by school curriculum guidelines, and Japanese persimmon seasoned in vinegar, Nara Noppei (stewed root vegetables and thick tofu), and Cha-Meshi (rice seasoned with tea and grains) were selected as local dishes...|$|R
5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> or {{preservation}} and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology. Because of the capacity of this group to produce an enormous range of natural products with antimicrobial or other biological activities, many species have long been used or are being developed for industrial production of antibiotics, vitamins, and anti-cancer and cholesterol-lowering drugs. More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways of pharmaceutical production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E
