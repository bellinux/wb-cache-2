5|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of camouflage, the {{intention}} of dazzle is not to conceal but to {{make it difficult to}} estimate a target's range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so to take up a poor <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward <b>firing</b> <b>position,</b> or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b> In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E

5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear <b>firing</b> <b>position,</b> C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his <b>firing</b> <b>position</b> against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b> On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Parliamentarian forces {{began to}} prepare a <b>firing</b> <b>position</b> in Gosport under the {{direction}} of John Meldrum. The Royalist forces attempted to bombard the position but their shots had little effect.

25|$|On 1 June, the {{submarine}} {{was searching for}} Japanese shipping off Sagami Nada when she sighted two columns of smoke. She closed the range toward a <b>firing</b> <b>position,</b> made out two cargo ships, and fired a spread of three torpedoes at each target. Hit in her stern, the lead ship, Noborikawa Maru, sank immediately. The second ship saw the torpedo wakes, turned and passed between them. Trigger then fired a torpedo at the oncoming ship; if the torpedo reached the target, it failed to explode.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{began with}} the Americans repulsing the British land attack on 14 September. Nicolls, ill at the time, was observing on Hermes. On 15 September, after {{contrary}} winds had died down, Percy crossed the bar with Hermes, Sophie, Carron, and Childers. The fort opened fire at 3:20p.m. and at 3:30 Hermes opened fire. The U.S. fort and Hermes were at musket-shot range. At 3:40, Sophie opened fire also, but the other two vessels {{were not able to}} get into a <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b> During the battle, a wooden splinter wounded Nicolls in the eye.|$|E
25|$|Flying a Tempest, French ace Pierre Clostermann {{claimed the}} first Allied combat {{encounter}} with a Dornier 335 in April 1945. In his book The Big Show (pp.273–274) he describes leading a flight of four Hawker Tempests from No. 3 Squadron RAF over northern Germany, when he intercepted a lone Do 335 flying at maximum speed at treetop level. Detecting the British aircraft, the German pilot reversed course to evade. Despite the Tempests' considerable low altitude speed, the Royal Air Force fighters {{were not able to}} catch up or even get into <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

25|$|The gun {{carriage}} {{was designed to}} be towed behind a limber and six horses; the lower carriage comprised a box trail. The QF 4.5 fired a separate round (i.e. shell and cartridge were loaded separately). The barrel was of built-up type, with a horizontal sliding block breech. A limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. It was designed for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation controls and sights on the left. The recoil system was below the barrel and used a hydraulic buffer with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator to return the barrel to its <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The M1 {{was very}} similar in {{construction}} and appearance to the 155mm Howitzer M1. The only significant difference was its tube of 4.5 inch (114mm) caliber. The tube had uniform right hand twist, with one turn in 32 calibers. The unbalanced weight of the barrel was supported by two equilibrator springs. The breach was of interrupted screw type; the recoil system hydropneumatic, variable length. The carriage was of split trail type, unsprung and had wheels with pneumatic tires. In <b>firing</b> <b>position,</b> the weapon {{was supported by a}} retractable pedestal. The gun was equipped with M12 panoramic sight.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Sailfish {{departed}} Manila on her first war patrol, destined for {{the west coast of}} Luzon. Early on 10 December, she sighted a landing force, supported by cruisers and destroyers, but could not gain <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b> On the night of 13 December, she made contact with two Japanese destroyers and began a submerged attack; the destroyers detected her, dropping several depth charges, while Sailfish fired two torpedoes. Despite a large explosion nearby, no damage was done, and the destroyers counterattacked with 18–20 depth charges. She returned to Manila on 17 December.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout of}} the DH.100 used a single jet engine {{installed}} in an egg-shaped fuselage which was primarily composed of plywood for the forward section and aluminium throughout the aft section. It was furnished with conventional mid-mounted straight wings; air brakes were installed on the wings to slow the aircraft, better enabling it to manoeuvre into a <b>firing</b> <b>position</b> behind slower aircraft - a feature that had also been incorporated in the Meteor. Armament comprised four 20mm Hispano Mk V cannon located underneath the nose; from {{the onset of the}} design phase, even when the aircraft was officially intended to serve only as an experimental aircraft, the provision for the cannon armament had been included.|$|E
25|$|The F1AZ {{features}} an integrated ground-attack system, comprising two on-board computers that can identify targets {{at a distance}} of 5km. A laser range finder, situated below its conical nose, is connected to the computers to provide them with target info without emitting radar signals. After target identification and information gathering, bombs are automatically released at the right moment. While the range-finding ability of the EMD AIDA 2 radar permits the use of combat and visual interception missiles, the helmet-mounted sight element enables the pilot to make bore attacks, without waiting until achieving an optimum <b>firing</b> <b>position.</b> The F1AZ is equipped with two internal DEFA 30mm cannons with 125 rounds each, and carries a wide variety of external ordnance, including various types of bombs, cluster munitions, missiles, and rocket launchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the <b>firing</b> <b>position</b> had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so {{it had to be}} re-aimed between every shot.|$|E
50|$|On the East Beach two heavy {{machine guns}} had been dug in {{at each end}} of the beach and {{fortified}} <b>firing</b> <b>positions</b> had been built every 20 metres behind a sand berm connected by a shallow zig-zag trench.
