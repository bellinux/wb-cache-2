[37, 38] showed stacked cup CNT could be grown from amorphous SiO 2 nano-particles. However, {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopic studies showed the nano-particles {{at the root of}} the CNT to be SiC. Their data points to the carbo-thermal reduction of SiO 2. This result is in contrast to X-ray photoemission studies (XPS) by Huang et al. [36] which did not show any carbide formation and hence they argued growth occurred from the SiO 2 particles. Steiner et al. [32] also conducted XPS studies and also found no evidence for carbide formation when using zirconia as the catalyst. However, it should be noted that Bachmatiuk et al. [37] also found no carbide formation when using XPS despite other techniques clearly demonstrating the presence of carbides. This suggests XPS, which is a surface sensitive technique, may not be best suited to determine if oxides used as catalysts for CNT growth reduce to carbides or not during synthesis. Various other oxides, outside of those mentioned, including TiO 2 and lanthanide oxides can also be used to grow carbon nanotubes [36]. Templated CNT grown in porous alumina without catalyst particles have also been demonstrated [39].

Compared to {{the sensitivity of}} capillary LC/MS (flow rate of 6 [*]μL/min) coupled with a conventional electrospray ionisation source, the nano-LC/MS (flow rate of 0. 6 [*]μL/min) with a nanoflow ion source was shown to increase the sensitivity ten-fold with a detection limit in the low-femtomole range. The absolute signals for the [MnH]n− ions of the oligosaccharides were increased 100 -fold, enabling accumulation of high-quality fragmentation data in MS 2 mode, in which detection of low abundant sequence ions is necessary for characterisation of highly sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides.

40|$|Glycoproteins, {{and their}} subset proteoglycans, are an {{important}} group of molecules in joint tissues, providing crucial functions such as cartilage structural integrity and lubrication at cartilage surfaces. The functionality of these glycoproteins is attributable to their oligosaccharide components, however surprisingly {{little is known about}} their fine structural details. With the use of glycoproteomic methods, this thesis presents the development and incorporation of mass spectrometric, biochemical and immunological methods to elucidate glycoprotein structures in synovial fluids, chondrocytes and synoviocytes in order to provide insight into how their structures may contribute to their functions. Initially, anion exchange chromatography was used to extract the acidic fraction containing glycoproteins and proteoglycans in arthritic synovial fluid (SF) samples, followed by proteomic analysis to identify the main glycoproteins in 1 D-SDS-PAGE gels. To complement these findings, an in-gel enzymatic digest method for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and oligosaccharide analysis was developed for analysis of glycoproteins by <b>graphitised</b> carbon liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Further characterization of the major glycoprotein, lubricin, was pursued by investigating its interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) from its cellular sources and characterising the secreted lubricin with Western blot and proteomic analysis. Finally, the <b>graphitised</b> carbon LC-MS method was applied to analyse the overall glycosylation profiles of lubricin. The major glycoprotein found in arthritic synovial fluid was lubricin, as identified by peptide LC-MS and Western blot. <b>Graphitised</b> carbon LC-MS identified the major chondroitin sulfate (CS) repeat region disaccharides and linkage region oligosaccharides of aggrecan with confirmation through tandem mass spectra and Western blots using CS linkage region stub antibodies. Application of this method to lubricin led to the discovery of O-linked oligosaccharide structures which were previously undescribed for lubricin. A higher proportion of sialylated oligosaccharide structures were detected in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples compared to the osteoarthritic (OA) samples, which signifies a diagnostic difference between these diseases. Sulfated oligosaccharide structures were also detected on synovial fluid lubricin, correlated with Western blot reactivity with the MECA- 79 antibody, thus suggesting a role for lubricin in inflammation.

Two-dimensional distribution of <b>graphitised</b> carbon, amorphous carbonaceous matter and minerals were obtained on 100 ?m 2 maps.

40|$|Test {{samples were}} {{collected}} at a range of sites using the MDHS 68 sampler, a 7 -hole sampler, and a cyclone respirable-dust sampler. Glass fibre, Zefluor, Fluoropore and silver (0. 8 and 5 fim) filters were compared for weighing error, handling characteristics, and amount collected. The effects of a carbon back-up, of extraction solvent, and of analytical method were studied. The current HSE method for the sampling and analysis of coal tar pitch volatile*, MDHS 68 has been reviewed. It is recommended that the MDHS 68 sampler {{be replaced by a}} 7 -hole head containing a silver or PTFE filter (~ 1 fim pore size), with a <b>graphitised</b> carbon back-up if efficient collection of 2 to 4 -ring PAHs is required. Cyclohexane is recommended as the extraction solvent. Methods of analysis which quantify the fume as a whole (MDHS 68, u. v., ELSD) were shown to give a response which varied according to the type of CTPV generating process. Therefore analysis of specific PAHs of occupational interest, by GC-MS or HPLC is recommended. Crown copyright © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Graphite {{has high}} {{in-plane}} thermal conductivity {{and is a}} potential candidate to combat the thermal management problems in high density electronic devices. However, the properties of graphite are not fully exploited and this study was carried out {{with the aim of}} fabricating and analysing high thermally conducting graphite based composites. Model composites were prepared with three different average flake sizes: 180 μm, 300 μm and 600 μm. The constituents(flakes and binders) were characterised in terms of density, carbon yield and crystallographic perfection using combination of techniques. The electrical resistivity of a single flake was found to be 0. 6 μS 2 m. A fabrication route was developed using 75 % starting volume fraction (67 % - 72 %) estimated volume fraction in the composite) of small flake graphite. A high volume fraction was used so as to obtain composites with properties dominated by the flakes. The selection of the optimum route of fabrication was based on achieving the lowest electrical resistivity of the composite after carbonisation (1000 °C). An extensive study was carried out on composites prepared using 75 % (starting volume fraction) flakes. The mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the flake size. The optical texture of small flake composites showed that the binder was inhomogeneously distributed and was observed to shrink away from the flakes whereas in the case of composites with large flakes, the binder was found to wet the flakes. The layers of the binder were also found to align along the basal planes of the flakes {{in the vicinity of the}} flakes. The composites with small flakes were found to be `brittle' whereas the large flake composites showed a more `ductile' behaviour. The Young's modulus and work-of-fracture were estimated from load versus extension curves. Raman studies showed an increase in the a-direction coherence length in the binder with an increase in heat-treatment temperature and the electrical resistivity of the composites was found to decrease with increase in flake size and heat-treatment temperature. The thermal conductivities were determined and samples were imaged in a thermal microscope. Comparison between quantitative thermal conductivity and that predicted using Lavin's relationship showed that Lavin's relationship is not applicable to these composites. A thermal conductivity of 655 W/m K (160 % of that of copper) was achieved in <b>graphitised</b> large flake composites. The volume fraction of graphite was varied (estimated volume fraction 45 %- 75 % in the composite) and <b>graphitised</b> large flake composites were studied. The density of the composites increased with an increase in the volume fraction whereas the mis-alignment of the 002 plane was found to decrease with an increase in the estimated volume fraction of graphite up to - 70 %. When the estimated volume fraction of graphite was further increased (- 75 %), the mis-alignment was found to increase. This was attributed to the microstructure which showed high packing density giving rise to twisting and distortion of flakes in the composite. Existing composite-type models failed to correctly predict the transport properties and hence, a first approach to developing a model specifically for these composites was attempted. However, due to their complex nature and insufficient information to define the modelling parameters its validity is uncertain. A thermal conductivity of 750 W/m K (190 % that of copper) and density - 1. 8 g/cm 3 (nearly one fourth of that of copper) and all this at relatively lower cost was achieved in <b>graphitised</b> large flake composites with - 75 % estimated volume fraction of graphite. This material is particularly attractive to combat thermal management problems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
