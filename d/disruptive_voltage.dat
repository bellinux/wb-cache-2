40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new stochastic {{approach to the}} comprehensive assessment {{of the impact of}} voltage sags on large-scale power networks. The approach takes into account the stochastic nature of power system operation, including load variation, uncertainty of fault clearing time by protection relays, fault rates of network components, and the variation/uncertainty in equipment sensitivity to voltage sags. A new duration zone division method is used to derive sag duration and occurrence frequency based on the stochastic distribution of clearing time required by specific protection systems. The adopted probabilistic representation facilitates estimation of network performance based on a single-event characteristic, sag severity index (SSI), developed in the companion paper (Part I). Based on SSI, a new single-site index with respect to voltage sags (bus performance index BPIS) is developed to comprehensively represent the overall bus performance with respect to voltage sags. The index is used to identify the areas of the network, called weak areas of the network in this paper, containing buses that are most exposed to potentially <b>disruptive</b> <b>voltage</b> sags. The application, robustness, and sensitivity of BPIS are thoroughly analyzed and discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of extra}} high voltage in {{electrical}} {{power transmission system}} causing corona. A visual corona phenomenon shown {{by the appearance of}} visible light radiation, hissing noise, ozone formation and power losses. The impact of corona affect the environment surrounding the overhead line transmission and power losses in the line. This research discusses power and energy losses due to corona by using quantitative method. Calculations performed by calculating relative air density values, <b>disruptive</b> critical <b>voltages,</b> power losses and corona energy. The research object was taken by extra high voltage Â overhead line transmission 500 kV Tanjung Jati B Power Plant to Ungaran Substation. The result show that corona power losses are 0. 41 - 0. 44 kW/mil (0. 25 - 0. 27 kw/km) per phase, with total 1. 25 - 1. 30 kW/mil (0. 78 - 0. 81 k/w/km). corona power losses 107. 57 - 112. 08 kW along of line. Average of corona energy losses obtained 2642. 67 kWh. The percentage of corona power losses to electrical power supplied is between 0. 005 % to 0. 011 %. </p...|$|R
