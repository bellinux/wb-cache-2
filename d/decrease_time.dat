50|$|Complexity of {{an object}} or system is a {{relative}} property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape Turing machines are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. Random Access Machines allow one to even more <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity {{can be an important}} factor of complexity.|$|E
50|$|Data {{exist for}} several {{antiarrhythmic}} drugs. Flecainide and propafenone but not amiodarone {{were reported to}} <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> domain measures of HRV in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmia. In another study, propafenone reduced HRV and decreased LF much more than HF. A larger study confirmed that flecainide, also encainide and moricizine, decreased HRV in post-MI patients but found no correlation between the change in HRV and mortality during follow-up. Thus, some antiarrhythmic drugs associated with increased mortality can reduce HRV. However, {{it is not known}} whether these changes in HRV have any direct prognostic significance.|$|E

This additional step in the vasectomy procedure, (and similarly, fascial interposition), has shown positive results but is not as prominently in use, and few surgeons offer it as part of their vasectomy procedure.|$|E

Such an interface would also allow AMD to outsource the design and test of the management card to industry experts. AMD reasoned that external audiences would derive these same benefits as its internal engineering teams and so OPMA was documented and released.|$|E
50|$|A {{weighted}} {{shift knob}} is a performance driven aftermarket modification which entirely replaces the OEM shift knob and sits atop the aftermarket short shifter or OEM manual shift stick. Initially {{designed to be}} used in tandem with a short shifter, it is increasingly being purchased for stock stick shifts. The weight generally varies between 400 and 600 grams or more, depending on the material used. The principle of the weighted shift knob is to make the stick shifter top heavy, thus increasing the throw momentum in order to <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> between shifts. Weighted gear knobs are offered for sale by a variety of North American-based manufacturers in many shapes and finishes, though they are significantly more expensive than the commonly available aftermarket shift knob.|$|E

Refugees are cutting trees and hunting some of wild animals in community forests while “Wasukuma” are accompanied with big flocks of cattle which cause environmental degradation and sometimes feed on/destroy crops in the farms.|$|E
5000|$|Orfalea {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that disentangling him from Kinko's took enormous effort from the lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. [...] The problem was that rather than adopt the traditional franchising model (by which the promoter creates a corporation that sells franchises), he had built the company {{as a series of}} loosely connected personal partnerships between each store owner and himself. [...] By 1997, he had established over 127 Kinko's partnerships. [...] All had to be carefully dismantled and rolled into a single S corporation to convert the company to a more centralized corporate-owned business model. Orfalea and several other key partners believed doing so would <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> Orfalea spent mediating disputes between different factions of Kinko's partnerships and enable the oldest partners to cash out smoothly and transition to a new generation of managers. However, the new structure also made it easier for CDR to gradually force him out of his own company.|$|E
5000|$|In the brain, {{serotonin}} is a neurotransmitter and regulates arousal, behavior, sleep, and mood, {{among other}} things. During prolonged exercise where {{central nervous system}} fatigue is present, serotonin levels in the brain are higher than normal physiological conditions; these higher levels can increase perceptions of effort and peripheral muscle fatigue. The increased synthesis of brain serotonin occurs because of {{a higher level of}} tryptophan, the serotonin precursor, in the blood and which results in larger amounts of tryptophan crossing the blood-brain barrier. An important factor of serotonin synthesis is the transport mechanism of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier. The transport mechanism for tryptophan is shared with the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine. During extended exercise, BCAAs are consumed for skeletal muscle contraction, allowing for greater transport of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier. None of the components of the serotonin synthesis reaction are saturated under normal physiological conditions, allowing for the increased production of the neurotransmitter. However the failure of BCAAs to <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> to fatigue consistently limit this hypothesis ...|$|E

50|$|The downsides of {{telemedicine}} {{include the}} cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, {{an increased risk of}} error when medical services are delivered {{in the absence of a}} registered professional, and an increased risk that protected health information may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission. There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually <b>decrease</b> <b>time</b> efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a teledermatology consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation. Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor. Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.|$|E
