500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E

It is a product of this racing, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> it happened. The last thing I want to do is hit someone like that. Unfortunately, it happened.’’ ...|$|E
2500|$|During the album's production, Vaughan {{appeared}} at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the US national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner"; his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage, Vaughan acquired an autograph from Mickey Mantle, who was a former player for the New York Yankees. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press: [...] "As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid {{enough to know that}} he wanted Mickey Mantle's autograph. Mantle obliged. 'I never signed a guitar before.' Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure he'd be dead before he hit 30." [...] Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrix's rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison: [...] "I heard they even wrote about it in one of the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> stuff. His version was great." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Martin's nose make up took 90 {{minutes to}} apply {{every day and}} two minutes to take off. [...] "God how <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> thing," [...] he said.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} how <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> word!" [...] she murmured. [...] "I may never see you again, you know, after this evening, {{so it really}} does not matter--but would you mind calling me Adelaide?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, but I was just going to defend my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey thanked Lexa's creators, and said, [...] "It {{has been}} an honour to portray [...] To envelop myself in her skin. To be given the freedom to {{represent}} a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted." [...] At her second Q panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, [...] "It saddens me to think that this was an event that tarnished the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemper {{gained some}} Internet fame in August 2007 {{for her part}} in [...] "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site Derrick Comedy. The video, which was {{circulated}} on the popular site CollegeHumor, was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform oral sex on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing. Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with The A.V. Club: [...] "I really don't like that video, and I wish that I hadn't done it, even though I know that it's a joke. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> it got sort of big, because I don't think that it's that funny and I don't want {{that to be the}} epitome of my work. It's just one video in a sea of many, but it has made me conscious of not wanting to do a video like that again." [...] Kemper has also contributed an article to CollegeHumor entitled [...] "Regarding Our Decision Never to See Me Again." [...] She also had a minor role in the 2009 film Mystery Team. Kemper starred in the fake iPhone commercial on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in January 2007, six months before the first iPhone was released. Kemper appeared in the Sofia Coppola comedy-drama Somewhere in 2010. She appeared in Bridesmaids in 2011. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Kemper would be voicing a character in an episode of the animated sitcom American Dad!.|$|E
60|$|With some irritation, for <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> {{sentence}} of Brother John's, I replied that I had arranged nothing, but that as {{none of them}} seemed to have any suggestions to make, I would go out and talk the matter over with Hans and Mavovo, which I did.|$|R
5000|$|It's high-octane, edge of {{the seat}} stuff, and gives a far truer {{representation}} of Dredd than the first movie. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> plot. It was Dredd pressed through the Hollywood cliché mill, a dynastic power struggle that had little connection with the character {{we know from the}} comic.|$|R
6000|$|Then Ormsgill strode forward masterfully, {{and it was}} {{a minute}} later when she smiled up at him. [...] "This," [...] she said, [...] "is not what I meant to do--at least, just now--but when I saw you looking so worn and anxious and remembered that you were still a {{prisoner}} I forgot how <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> Englishwoman. <b>I</b> only remembered how I loved you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "For land's sake! Yes, I do," [...] exclaimed the other. [...] "If {{there was}} a home in that California, I never saw it. Tents and log cabins and mud-holes! Such places {{for a woman to}} live. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> California! A lot of wild men, all crazy for gold. Gold that only a few could find and none could keep!... I pray every night to live to get back home." ...|$|R

5000|$|Rejtman uses {{a minimalist}} style when making films.

6000|$|... "I am not crying, Shirley; or if I am, it is nothing. Go on; {{you are no}} friend if you {{withhold}} from me the truth. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>that</b> false plan of disguising, mutilating the truth." ...|$|E
