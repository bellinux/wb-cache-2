5|$|Although it {{was once}} widely {{believed}} that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern Mexico and Central America, aided in their <b>expansion</b> by deforestation, Pleistocene and Early Holocene records, as well as records from the pre-Columbian period and early European colonization show that the animal was present in the area long before modern times. Nevertheless, range <b>expansion</b> did occur south of Costa Rica during the late 1970s and northern Panama in the early 1980s, following the <b>expansion</b> of cattle-grazing lands into tropical rainforests. The coyote is predicted to appear in northern Belize in the near future, as the habitat there is favorable to the species. Concerns have been raised of a possible <b>expansion</b> into South America through the Panamanian Isthmus, should the Darién Gap ever be closed by the Pan-American Highway. This fear was partially confirmed in January 2013, when the species was recorded in eastern Panama's Chepo District, beyond the Panama Canal.|$|E
