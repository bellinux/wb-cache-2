5|$|The poem, {{following}} the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from {{various parts of}} Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> dates older than the vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed {{by one or more}} individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). <b>It</b> <b>hardly</b> extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E

25|$|The Latécoère 350 first flew on 2 February 1931, piloted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It {{turned out}} that the 350 had come out more than 30% overweight, an excess of about a tonne. Consequently the useful load was reduced from the design {{estimate}} of 1,000kg (2,205lbs) to about 350kg (772lbs), making the 350 quite unfit for purpose. In view of that, <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> mattered that flight tests showed that some of the performance estimates were optimistic: maximum speed was 5% less and the stalling speed higher. Since the aircraft was government funded and its property, Saint-Exupéry flew it to Villacoublay early in 1933. Its career thereafter is not recorded.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1984, the Steelers played on the road in the AFC Championship Game, but <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> mattered as they forced four {{turnovers}} and went into halftime with a 24–3 lead en route to advancing to their sixth Super Bowl appearance in team history. In doing so, Pittsburgh became the first #6 playoff seed (since the league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990) to advance to the Super Bowl. Second-year quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, already in his fifth career playoff game, completed 21 of 29 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns (one each to Cedrick Wilson and Hines Ward) and ran for a third. Steelers running back Jerome Bettis rushed for the other touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Most fronts were {{relatively}} quiet throughout 1696: the armies in Flanders, along the Rhine, and in Catalonia, marched and counter-marched but little was achieved. Louis XIV's hesitancy {{to engage with}} the Allies (despite the confidence of his generals) may have reflected {{his knowledge of the}} secret talks that had begun more than a year earlier—with François de Callières acting for Louis XIV, and Jacob Boreel and Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt representing the Dutch. By the spring of 1696 the talks covered the whole panorama of problems that were proving an obstacle to peace. The most difficult of these were the recognition of the Prince of Orange as the King of England and the subsequent status of James II in France; the Dutch demand for a barrier against future French aggression; French tariffs on Dutch commerce; and the territorial settlements in the Rhine–Moselle areas regarding the Reunions and the recent conquests, particularly the strategically important city of Strasbourg. Louis XIV had succeeded in establishing the principle that a new treaty would be fixed {{within the framework of the}} Treaties of Westphalia and Nijmegen, and the Truce of Ratisbon, but with the Emperor's demands for Strasbourg, and William III's insistence that he be recognized as King of England before the conclusion of hostilities, <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> seemed worthwhile in calling for a peace conference.|$|E

[...] Beauchamp later said he had ignored the warrant, dated October 25, 1825, {{on the advice of}} a friend who termed it harassment. He also said he had arranged for the warrant, as an excuse to be in Frankfort to kill Sharp. The historian Fred Johnson says that Beauchamp likely added the warrant into his story after the fact, as a means of damage control. <b>It</b> <b>hardly</b> looked good for him to have committed the act for which he ostensibly killed Sharp.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{on the album}} was mainly handled by Easy Mo Bee and The Hitmen. Cheo H.

The tracks only enhance them, whether it's the live bass driving a menacing undercurrent or [...] use of bluesy guitar and wah-wah feedback" [...] and that the production is used to [...] "push the rapper to new heights." [...] The production is mainly sample-based with the samples varying from the percussion of funk tracks to the vocals of hip hop songs. Steve Huey presented some criticism over the beats, stating that the [...] "deliberate beats do get a little samey, but <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> matters: this is Biggie's show".|$|E

500|$|Slaton's {{narrative}} {{touched on}} {{other aspects of}} the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense's argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense's interpretation of the timeline; [...] citing the evidence produced at trialincluding the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer officehe wrote: [...] "Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> seems possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered." [...] Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.|$|E
500|$|Dude Ranch, {{which became}} the trio's first gold record in January 1998, yielded three more singles, which did not attract the same {{commercial}} success as [...] "Dammit". [...] "Apple Shampoo" [...] was the second single release from Dude Ranch, released in October 1997. [...] "Although it didn't have the impact of [...] "Dammit", <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> mattered as the former was still receiving heavy play on radio and TV stations across the nation", wrote journalist Joe Shooman. [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was released in February 1998 but failed to register on charts. [...] "Josie" [...] became the record's fourth and final single in November 1998. Its music video also received MTV airplay and the single charted at number31 in Australia. For the single release of both [...] "Dammit" [...] and [...] "Josie", the songs were remixed and remastered by Tom Lord-Alge. The unreleased Dude Ranch cut [...] "I Won't Be Home for Christmas" [...] was released as an international single in 2001, only successful in Canada, but charting for six non-consecutive weeks at number one.

500|$|Negative reviews {{focused on}} the lack of {{character}} depth or atmosphere. Jaime N.

[...] In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors [...] "are treated as accessories", and that the director is [...] "workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian — that's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?" [...] In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: [...] "Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott’s two masterpieces – Alien and Blade Runner – it’s not even on the same continent." ...|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Wright, {{writing in}} The Guardian, commended the script of [...] "La Couchette", calling it [...] "a delight, with one line {{delivered}} by Jack Whitehall quite {{possibly the most}} gloriously tasteless you'll hear on television all year". Ferguson offered a similar view, saying that Whitehall delivered [...] "seriously undeliverable lines with entirely believable gusto". Tate said that though he found the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode fairly predictable, the [...] "writing and performances were so engaging that <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> mattered". The episode was, for him, [...] "inventive" [...] and [...] "deliciously wicked". Similarly, though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical, he said that the writers [...] "scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution". Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described [...] "La Couchette" [...] as [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "sharply observed". He commended the cast, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith [...] "give a mini-masterclass" [...] in their performances. Jones called the episode [...] "toilet humour with a twist", saying that [...] "It was Jorg's grunting and squatting that produced the episode's impressively grotesque climax, but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line: 'We're going to need a bigger box!'" [...] Billen commended the cast, and Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website PopMatters, described Gunning as one of the stand-out guest stars of the second series.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times editor Ernesto Lecnher {{gave the}} album one-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars and claimed that Romances [...] "sinks under its own weight, {{delivering}} mostly bloated versions of timeless material". Fellow Los Angeles Times contributor Ed Morales disagreed with his review: [...] "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, snuggle up with his significant other and really listen to 'Romances.' I give his review * and 'Romances' ****" [...] Anne Valdespino of the Los Angeles Daily News praised the selection of songs and Miguel's performance, calling the performer a [...] "class act". The San Diego Union-Tribune music critic Ernesto Portillo Jr. rated Romances three-out-of four stars and claimed that Miguel's [...] "interpretations are first-rate and the music, with production help from famed composer Armando Manzanero, is executed with exquisite precision". However, he questioned {{the need for a}} third in the Romance series as he felt it [...] "diminishes the specialness" [...] of Romance and Segundo Romance noted that not all tracks in the album are [...] "true boleros". El Nuevo Herald editor Eliseo Cardona wrote a mostly positive review of the album. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the productions but stated that Migule's interpretation of [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] "pales" [...] compared to Lucho Gatica and José José's cover of the song. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News said Romances [...] "sparkles with the joy of visiting good friends" [...] and lauded its [...] "timeless music, beautiful orchestration" [...] and complimented Silvetti's arrangements.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So <b>it</b> <b>hardly</b> {{came as a surprise}} to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary.
