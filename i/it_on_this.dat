5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
25|$|However, {{well into}} the 20th century it was often assumed that the {{presence}} of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> basis, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica said that Southwell and St Asaph were cities.|$|E
500|$|The {{desire to}} write fiction persisted, however, {{and in the}} autumn of 1927 Waugh began a comic novel which he {{entitled}} Picaresque: or the Making of an Englishman. The first pages were read to another friend, the future novelist Anthony Powell, who found them very amusing, and was surprised when Waugh told him, just before Christmas, that the manuscript had been burned. This was not in fact the case; Waugh had merely put the work aside. Early in 1928 he wrote to Harold Acton, asking whether or not he should finish <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> occasion Acton was full of praise; Waugh resumed work, and completed the novel by April 1928. It was published later that year under a new title, Decline and Fall.|$|E

500|$|In 1881, Coolbrith's poetry was {{published}} in book form, entitled A Perfect Day, and Other Poems. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, after Coolbrith's publisher sent him a copy, said [...] "I know that California {{has at least one}} poet." [...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I have been reading them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It said, simply, [...] "Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced." [...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all who have seen <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> side of the Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast. He told her [...] "there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus {{argued that}} the only moral {{obligations}} that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing[...] Scotus {{argued that the}} natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments {{do not belong to}} the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments [...] "are highly consonant with , though they do not follow necessarily from first practical priciples that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect ...|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the music for}} the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, [...] "We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. [...] Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. [...] Just everything." [...] Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records Nimrod and International Superhits! to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be [...] "at once uniform and powerful". The album's artwork—"a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist"—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric [...] "And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade" [...] from [...] "She's a Rebel". Influenced by artist Saul Bass's poster for the 1955 drama film The Man with the Golden Arm, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the [...] "most overused color in graphic design", {{he felt that the}} [...] "immediate" [...] qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, [...] "I'm sure there's psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer I always feel it's kind of a cop-out, so I never used it before. But there was no way you couldn't use <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> cover." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Reitman was working on a screenplay, based on Joyce Maynard's novel. Talking about the story, Reitman said that [...] "I read it, and I saw the movie in my head. It challenged me in a way that I liked. It was different from everything else I’ve read." [...] He also admitted that it was completely different from his previous work and said that [...] " [...] deals with a very complex drama. And I may not nail <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> film, it may just be my first step." [...] Reitman wanted to make the film right after his 2009 film Up in the Air, but due to Winslet's scheduling conflicts, he chose to direct Young Adult first.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{employed}} a parable {{to explain why}} God held Aaron as well as Moses responsible when Moses struck the rock, as [...] reports, [...] "and the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: ‘Because you {{did not believe in}} Me.'" [...] The Midrash told how a creditor came to take away a debtor's granary and took both the debtor's granary and the debtor's neighbor's granary. The debtor asked the creditor what his neighbor had done to warrant such treatment. Similarly, Moses asked God what Aaron had done to be blamed when Moses lost his temper. The Midrash taught that <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> account that [...] praises Aaron, saying, [...] "And of Levi he said: ‘Your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jon Nelson {{also has}} criticized Morey for {{incorrect}} quotes. Nelson {{notes that in}} Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception {{as an example of}} atheist deception, but the [...] "problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like <b>it)</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even if you feel that he has a good argument and that your case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'" [...] Nelson goes on to say that, [...] "However, Morey has an 'out'. There are no actual quotation marks on these alleged quotes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st {{century and}} at least until 2010, the Japanese company Clover was {{producing}} the bright green pendant Mini Kacha-Kacha which is designed like a hand-held mechanical tally counter, but is oriented upside-down on a neck pendant for easy reading by the user. It has a button to advance the numbers singly, access to the knurled number rings for adjustment of numbers, and a lock to prevent interference by the user dropping the gadget or by children playing with <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> type of gadget it has been possible for the manufacturer to make the numbers larger and therefore easier to read than on the on-needle counter, which needs to be small. [...] In August 2007 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.32 gave away a free pendant knitting counter in a form of a white sheep, and in June 2010 the same magazine no.67 gave away another one {{in the shape of}} a yellow flower. Unfortunately the numerals on the yellow flower version were oriented incorrectly, causing inconvenience for the wearer of the pendant.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Presley re-recorded [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] for {{the soundtrack}} {{of the film}} G.I. Blues. While Presley's {{character}} and his band, the [...] "Three Blazes", play a ballad at a Frankfurt nightclub ("Doin' the Best I Can", by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman), a bored GI plays Presley's version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] on the jukebox, remarking that he wants [...] "to hear an original". When another soldier tries to unplug the jukebox, the audience erupts in a fight. This studio re-recording {{was one of the}} few occasions in Presley's career in which he agreed to re-record a previously issued song. He did <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion because the rest of the soundtrack was recorded in stereo, and thus a stereo version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] was required. The 1960 version uses virtually the same arrangement as the 1956 recording. This version was included on the soundtrack album to G.I. Blues but was never released as a single in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover {{a wide spread of}} subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related the story of a Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if people are looking for classic Bowie they'll find <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're going to find that on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E
2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life and place <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, that was how he wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was {{one of the hardest things}} emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] things to her was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Wilderness {{battle was}} costly for the Union, Grant {{decided to move}} south and {{continue}} the fight with Lee. [...] As the Army of the Potomac moved southward from the Wilderness, Grant, on May 8, was forced into yet an even more desperate 14-day battle at Spotsylvania. Anticipating Grant's right flank move, Lee was able to position his army at Spotsylvania Court House before Grant and his army could arrive. The battle started on May 10. [...] Although Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was located in an exposed rough arc known as the [...] "Mule Shoe", his army resisted multiple assaults from Grant's Army of the Potomac {{for the first six}} days of the battle. The fiercest fighting in the battle took place on a point known as [...] "Bloody angle". Rifles refused to fire due to the troops gunpowder getting wet from rainy weather and they were forced into a bloody hand-to-hand struggle similar to battles fought in ancient times. Both Confederates and Union soldiers were slaughtered and men were piled {{on top of each other}} in their attempt to control the point. [...] By May 21, the fighting had finally stopped; Grant had lost 18,000 men with 3,000 having been killed in the prolonged battle. [...] Many talented Confederate officers were killed in the battle with Lee's Army significantly damaged having a total of 10–13,000 casualties. [...] The popular Union Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick of the VI corps was killed in the battle by a sharpshooter and replaced by Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright.

[...] Rolling Stone ranked the song at number eight on its list of the 50 Best Singles of 2011, writing {{that it is a}} triumphal love song, [...] "slathered in crazy sauce; marching-band drums, backward-counting backup singers, honking horns", and praising its hook. Additionally, Rob Sheffield ranked the song at number 3 on his list of The Top 25 Songs of 2011 writing, [...] "The harder she tries to come on crazy, the less crazy she sounds. She might be the most aggressively sane pop diva ever, even when she's boofing her boof boof." [...] Consequence of Sound's staff placed [...] "Countdown" [...] at number four on their list of the Top 50 Songs of 2011 and wrote, [...] "Beyoncé has transcended the traditional confines of pop diva status ...
