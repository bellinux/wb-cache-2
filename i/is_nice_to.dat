5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E

500|$|McKenna {{consulted}} with acquaintances {{who worked in}} fashion to make her screenplay more realistic. In a 2010 British Academy of Film and Television Arts lecture, she told of a scene that was changed after one of these reviews, where Nigel told Andy not to complain so much about her job. Originally, she had made his speech more of a supportive pep talk; however one of those acquaintances said that would not happen: [...] "o-one in that world <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> each other ... There's no reason to be, and they don't have time." [...] she quoted him as saying.|$|E
500|$|You Are the Apple of My Eye {{is based}} on Giddens' semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. He changed some details of the story to make the film more dramatic; for example, Ching-teng and Chia-yi's fight {{actually}} took place over the phone, not in the rain as depicted. Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me. Also, if the film is not nice, it will be a letdown to Chen-tung and Michelle, who have been working so hard".|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West praised Fischer's [...] "masterful" [...] performance, {{writing that}} it [...] "really <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Pam coming into her own... And I love that she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in — she just ran right up and hugged him." [...] West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining {{that with the}} former, [...] "Michael is never completely loathsome — because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that [...] "the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments." [...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right moments. I thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide Adam Bryant {{called the}} scene with the bear [...] "one of the funniest moments on TV that week". Bryant also praised the story arc between Torres and Robbins, adding: [...] "I really like how honest Arizona is with Callie, {{and the way she}} puts the firecracker in her place." [...] He was {{positive}} of Leigh's performance, writing: [...] "Chyler Leigh gave a powerful performance in this episode. Her speech to Meredith was a little overwritten, but she almost made you forget that with her emotion. And the bond that is growing between Lexie and Meredith <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see. From Meredith finally saying out loud how she feels about Lexie, to Lexie being at Mer's side when she wakes up, I am really glad to see these sisters' happy." [...] Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post gave a positive review of the episode, commenting: [...] "I love how Grey's Anatomy can bounce between serious and hysterical moments. Old people wanting penile implants, bears attacking a groggy Alex, counterbalanced with Mercy West drama, Cristina being ignored, and Lexie's father arriving at the hospital hacking blood." [...] Pascua also praised the writing of Waite's character's storyline and Leigh's performance.|$|E

500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{wrote that}} [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{is one of}} the catchier upbeat songs Knowles has ever {{recorded}} and felt that it deserves to be a future single. Casey Hamilton of the Boston website Gather wrote that credit for the song's [...] "retro-radical nature" [...] goes to producer The-Dream, but it is Knowles herself who [...] "truly delivers the shock value, managing to make a lightly introspective, loosely insightful, and largely entertaining tune", before adding that it contains the sexiest lyrical content she has ever attempted. Hamilton concluded that Knowles' vocals effectively match the funky and fun vibe of [...] "Schoolin' Life", and concluded that the latter showcases [...] "a side of the singer that <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see and even nicer to hear". Duncan Cooper of The Fader magazine wrote that the song is [...] "lyrically inspired, tough as hell and easily the best thing" [...] on 4. Danielle Cheesman of MSN Music commented that [...] "'Schoolin' Life' steals the whole entire spotlight", further noting that it channels the [...] "trademark friskiness" [...] of Prince. He commended how Knowles [...] "unleashes her inner (and innate) freak singing". Cheesman concluded [...] "how this isn't on the original is beyond me", before adding that there [...] "maybe one extra single [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Kapoor {{followed}} her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with {{a role in}} Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows {{the story of two}} strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana knows what she is doing. Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." [...] The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of [...] in India and abroad. The Hollywood Reporter found her [...] "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that [...] "after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One, it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met." [...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to do something}} like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> know that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E
