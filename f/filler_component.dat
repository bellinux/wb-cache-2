40|$|Due to the {{migration}} of scientists towards green chemistry, landfilling and incineration {{will no longer be}} acceptable options for plastics waste disposal in the future. Consequently new methods for recycling plastics and plastic products such as carpets are being researched. This study serves as a preliminary effort to study the catalytic feedstock recycling of polyolefins, specifically PP and PE, as source for gasoline range fuels, as well as an alternative for plastic waste disposal. Several studies have been conducted on the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins using commercial cracking catalysts (FCC), however, the effect of catalyst size and mode of catalyst dispersion have been studied sparsely. This thesis proposes to study these effects in the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), a component of carpets, using both fresh and used FCC catalysts. The same study will be applied to polyethylene (PE), which accounts for an enormous amount of municipal solid waste in the US today. Furthermore, the catalytic impact of calcium carbonate, a <b>filler</b> <b>component</b> of tufted carpet, will be investigated. Using thermogravimetric analysis, the global kinetics of the PP pyrolysis using various FCC catalysts will be derived and applied in the modeling of the pyrolysis reaction in a twin screw extruder.

30|$|These results {{indicate}} that the presence of the CNT serves as additional tool of bounding between different GNP puddles and vice versa. From this point of view, if one of the <b>filler</b> <b>components</b> has smaller AR than another one, percolation threshold of the mixed filler will significantly degrade. Only particles with similar aspect ratios are capable to mutually complement each other. Also, it is important to notice that existing experimental explanation of synergism affects other aspects of percolation in ternary composites. Results seem to indicate that GNP could prevent re-aggregation of the CNT bundles [5] and hence increase electroconductivity. Synergism originates from the bridging of planar nanoplatelets by the flexible CNT which leads to a decreased thermal interface resistance along the (2 D- 1 D) hybrid filler network due to the extended area of the SWNT-GNP junctions [6]. Our results witness that the main condition of appearing of strong synergism between different <b>components</b> of the <b>filler</b> is similarity of their aspect ratios. The bigger difference between ARs we have, the smaller synergism can be observed. Other morphology parameters of CNT or GNP are insignificant.|$|R

The principal {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the microleakage of UltraSeal XT® hydro™ as a function of different enamel etching techniques. The occlusal surfaces of sound, extracted human molars were either acid etched, Er:YAG laser irradiated or successively laser irradiated and acid etched. UltraSeal XT® hydro™ was applied to each group of teeth (n= 10) which were subjected to a thermocycling process consisting of 2500 cycles between 5 and 50 °C with a dwell time of 30 s. Microleakage assessments were then carried out using 0. 5 % fuchsin dye and optical microscopy. The microleakage score data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment. No significant differences in microleakage were noted between the individually acid etched and laser-irradiated groups (p> 0. 05); however, teeth treated with a combination of laser irradiation and acid etching demonstrated significantly lower microleakage scores (p< 0. 001). Electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis revealed that the mineral <b>filler</b> <b>component</b> of UltraSeal XT® hydro™ essentially comprises micrometre-sized particles of inorganic silicon-, aluminium- and barium-bearing phases.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{effectiveness}} of polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) for the preparation of clay-based nanocomposites by melt intercalation and to upgrade the mechanical performance of these materials, solid-state-polymerization (SSP) experiments with neat PTT were carried out at 190, 200, and 210 °C prior compounding to increase the average molecular weight and, based on this, the melt viscosity of this polymer. The progress of SSP was registered by time dependent sampling of intrinsic viscosity data. From this, activation energy of 180. 6 kJ mol - 1 was calculated. A characteristic sublimate formed during these SSP-reactions was identified by mass-spectroscopy to be a mixture of cyclic oligomers containing 2, 3, 4, and 5 monomeric units. The melt viscosity of neat PTT(SSP) could be increased from 460 to 15, 000 Pa s - 1. Therefore, tensile strength and Young's modulus were improved by 3. 5 and 9 %, respectively. Manufacturing of PTT(SSP) and the modified nanoclay was carried out with a corotating twin-screw-extruder at 230 °C. A concentration of 3 % of the inorganic <b>filler</b> <b>component</b> in the composites was aimed at.

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of the {{interfacial}} region between an organic polymer matrix and an inorganic <b>filler</b> <b>component</b> is essential in determining how this region impacts the overall bulk properties of the organic/inorganic hybrid composite material. In this work, polystyrene was used as the model polymer matrix coupled with silica-based filler materials to investigate {{the nature of}} structure-property relationships in polymer composites. Initial work was conducted on synthesis and characterization of colloidal and mesoporous silica particles melt blended into the polystyrene matrix. Modification of the interface was accomplished by chemically bonding the silica particles with the polystyrene chains through polymerization from the particle surface via atom transfer radical polymerization. High molecular weight polystyrene chains were formed and bulk test samples were evaluated with increased thermal stability of the grafted polymer composite system versus equivalent melt blended polymer composites. Polymer grafting was also conducted from the internal pores of mesoporous silica, further improving the thermal stability of the composite system without degrading dynamic mechanical properties. Characterization of the polymer composites was conducted with gel permeation chromatography, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis. It was also discovered during the polystyrene-silica composite studies that amorphous polystyrene can possess a less mobile phase, evident in a second peak of the loss tangent (tan ). The long annealing times necessitated by the mesoporous silica composites were replicated in as received polystyrene. This new, less mobile phase is of particular interest in determining the mobility of polymer chains in the interfacial region...|$|E

Research into extended porous {{materials such as}} metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic frameworks (POFs), and their molecular analogues, metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) and porous organic cages (POCs), has blossomed over the last decade. Given their chemical and structural mutability and notable porosity, MOFs have been proposed as novel adsorbents for industrial gas separations. In this context they have also been identified as promising <b>filler</b> <b>components</b> for high-performance mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Research in this area has focused on enhancing the chemical compatibility between the MOF and polymer phase by judiciously functionalising the organic linkers of the MOF, modifying the MOF surface chemistry and, more recently, exploring how particle size, morphology and distribution enhance separation performance. Other filler materials, including POFs, MOPs and POCs, are also being explored as additives for MMMs and have shown, unexpectedly, remarkable anti-aging performance and excellent chemical compatibility for commercially available polymers.

40|$|Silyl {{terminated}} polymers (MS Polymers) {{are produced}} in different forms. The most important family is silyl-terminated polyethers. Such MS Polymer grades containing a polyether backbone and methoxysilyl chain ends {{are used as}} the base resin for producing quality sealants and adhesives. Advantages of MS Polymers are excellent adhesion on various substrates, low temperature elasticity (Tg = - 60 °C), good weatherability and good workability. The rise in popularity of MS Polymer products is due to their versatility and well-balanced properties. The functionalized polyether backbone with methoxysilane terminal groups provides excellent performances and makes MS Polymer-based products unique and beneficial. Sealants based on MS Polymer are suitable {{for a wide range}} of applications in many different fields: construction industry, marine, general industry sectors, transportation. MS Polymer can be blended with epoxy resins to formulate high strength products. The heterogenic matrix/domain structure consists of the epoxy domains functioning as hard segments in the elastic MS Polymer matrix. This structure is useful to make sealants, adhesives, coatings which are high strength but still elastic.

40|$|Abstract Background Conventional {{knee and}} hip implant {{systems have been}} in use for many years with good success. However, the custom design of implant {{components}} based on patient-specific anatomy has been attempted to overcome existing shortcomings of current designs. The longevity of cementless implant components is highly dependent on the initial fit between the bone surface and the implant. The bone-implant interface design has historically been limited by the surgical tools and cutting guides available; {{and the cost of}} fabricating custom-designed implant components has been prohibitive. Methods This paper describes an approach where the custom design is based on a Computed Tomography scan of the patient's joint. The proposed design will customize both the articulating surface and the bone-implant interface to address the most common problems found with conventional knee-implant components. Finite Element Analysis is used to evaluate and compare the proposed design of a custom femoral component with a conventional design. Results The proposed design shows a more even stress distribution on the bone-implant interface surface, which will reduce the uneven bone remodeling that can lead to premature loosening. Conclusion The proposed custom femoral component design has the following advantages compared with a conventional femoral component. (i) Since the articulating surface closely mimics the shape of the distal femur, {{there is no need for}} resurfacing of the patella or gait change. (ii) Owing to the resulting stress distribution, bone remodeling is even and the risk of premature loosening might be reduced. (iii) Because the bone-implant interface can accommodate anatomical abnormalities at the distal femur, the need for surgical interventions and fitting of <b>filler</b> <b>components</b> is reduced. (iv) Given that the bone-implant interface is customized, about 40 % less bone must be removed. The primary disadvantages are the time and cost required for the design and the possible need for a surgical robot to perform the bone resection. Some of these disadvantages may be eliminated by the use of rapid prototyping technologies, especially the use of Electron Beam Melting technology for quick and economical fabrication of custom implant components. </p...|$|R
