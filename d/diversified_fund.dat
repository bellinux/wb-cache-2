40|$|We {{document}} {{a positive}} relation between mutual fund performance and managers' {{willingness to take}} big bets in {{a relatively small number}} of stocks. Focused managers outperform their more broadly diversified counterparts by approximately 30 basis points per month, or roughly 4 % annualized. The results hold for mimicking portfolios based on fund holdings as well as when returns are measured net of expenses. Concentrated managers outperform precisely because their big bets outperform the top holdings of more <b>diversified</b> <b>funds.</b> The evidence suggests that investors may enhance performance by diversifying across focused managers rather than by investing in highly <b>diversified</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

Controlling for various fund characteristics, fund performance is positively related to the fund’s number of holdings both before and after expenses. We find evidence linking focused fund underperformance to agency and liquidity problems. Finally, the attrition rate of focused funds is higher than that of <b>diversified</b> <b>funds.</b> These results do not support the view that managers holding focused portfolios have superior stock-picking skills or that focused funds provide value to investors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{the existence}} of sector funds (specialists) within a mutual fund family affects the performance and investment behavior of affiliated <b>diversified</b> equity <b>funds</b> (generalists). First of all, I show that specialists have stock picking skills. Second, information flows from the specialist to the generalist. The overlap in specialist and generalist industry sub-portfolios is positively related to the past track-record of the specialist in this industry and specialist work experience and negatively related to the overall work experience and the industry track-record of the generalist. Generally, stocks held by specialists appear in more <b>diversified</b> <b>funds</b> of the family than other stocks. As a result, <b>diversified</b> <b>funds</b> from fund families with sector funds perform better, trade more, and hold more hard-to-value stocks than their peers from families without sector funds...|$|R

40|$|In a given period, a <b>diversified</b> <b>fund,</b> {{by virtue}} of being a {{weighted}} average, will perform somewhere in the middle range of its components' respective performances. This means that adaptive investors who look to the past to adjust expectations about future returns will shun diversified funds. That is, adaptive reaction to feedback implies under-diversification when the investor gets complete feedback on the performance of the <b>diversified</b> <b>fund</b> as well as its components in a given period. Three laboratory experiments and one quasi field experiment explore this possibility and its implications. We find that the availability of complete feedback drastically reduces diversification. Under-diversification is observed even when the decision makers receive a complete description of the payoff distributions and when under-diversification lowers expected return.

40|$|If an {{investor}} wants {{to form a}} portfolio of risky assets and can exert effort to collect information on the future value of these assets before he invests, which assets should he learn about? The best assets to acquire information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets the investor holds depend on the information he observes. We build a framework to solve jointly for investment and information choices, {{with a variety of}} preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal research strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is that the investor who can first collect information systematically deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition can rationalize investing in a <b>diversified</b> <b>fund</b> and a concentrated set of assets, an allocation often observed, but usually deemed anomalous. ...|$|E

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThis {{research}} report investigates the Property Unit Trust (PUT) sector to assess {{if there are}} risk-sharing benefits to be obtained in building up a property portfolio. The report demonstrates that property trusts with diversified acquisition strategies achieve better risk sharing characteristics than those found in focused property funds. The ‘value at risk’ {{for each of the}} PUT’s was plotted over a 5 -year period against the underlying asset value of the properties. This quantified the factor by which the ‘value at risk’ increased as the asset value increased. The values for each PUT were compared to the index for the sector, as well as separate indices for focused and <b>diversified</b> <b>funds.</b> The investigation demonstrated that property portfolios do provide an opportunity for risk sharing, and that <b>diversified</b> <b>funds</b> provide greater risk sharing possibilities. This finding is crucial to asset managers who assemble property funds in that it provides insight in combating portfolio volatility...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{rational}} model of investors who choose which asset payo®s to acquire informa- tion about, before forming portfolios. Scale economies in information acquisition lead investors {{to specialize in}} learning about a set of highly-correlated assets. Knowing more about these assets makes them less risky and more desirable to hold. Bene¯ts to specialization compete with bene¯ts to diversi¯cation. The resulting asset portfolios appear under-diversi¯ed {{from the perspective of}} standard theory, but are optimal. In equilibrium, information is a strategic substitute because assets that many investors learn about have low expected returns. Increasing returns, combined with strategic substitutability leads ex-ante identical investors to specialize in di®erent information, and hold different portfolios. Information choice rationalizes investing in a <b>diversified</b> <b>fund</b> and a set of highly-correlated assets, an allocation observed in the data but usually deemed anomalous. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{solve the}} problem of an {{investor}} who chooses which assets' payoff to acquire information about before making an investment decision. Investors specialize because information has increasing returns: As an investor learns more about an asset, it becomes less risky and more desirable to hold; as he holds more of the asset, the value of information about it increases. Investors hold some fraction of their assets in a well <b>diversified</b> <b>fund,</b> about which they learn nothing, and hold the other fraction in a small set of highly-correlated assets that they specialize in learning about. In equilibrium, ex-ante identical investors acquire different information. Information is a strategic substitute because assets that many investors learn about have low expected returns. The theory can explain the empirical evidence that individual investors hold part of their equity portfolio in diversified mutual funds and the rest in a small number of highly-correlated assets. While such portfolios may appear under-diversified, they are optimal for investors who face constraints on how much information they can acquire. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a hedge fund}} manager's risk-taking profile and evaluate how fund composition and multiple evaluation periods affect risk-levels. The fund composition refers to the specific characteristics that result from investors entering the fund {{at different points in}} time, implying various maturities and strike levels for high-water mark incentive contracts. Multiple evaluation periods is the inclusion of long-term managerial compensation to the decision process. Using a numerical simulation framework we compute and analyse the optimal behaviour of a fund manager with constant relative risk aversion. In existing literature - where the fund is depicted as one, homogeneous pool of investments, evaluated over a single period - manager risk-taking fluctuates heavily depending on time to maturity and moneyness of the manager's incentive option. By introducing a <b>diversified</b> <b>fund</b> composition as well as accounting for multiple evaluation periods, the manager's behaviour is considerably less extreme, reducing manager-investor risk misalignment. Our results suggests that the fund composition is relevant to the individual investor, as it potentially affects the overall risk profile and thereby the value of the investment. Furthermore, our results prove an interesting study in examining the efficiency of option-like incentive contracts in relieving agency problems...|$|E

This study concentrates on public financial investment and on autonomy, two components of what we refer to as university ‘empowerment’ (Hoareau et al. 2013). European-wide the notion of university autonomy has been heavily debated in public policy, with various reforms aiming at increasing the autonomy of universities from the Central Government or State Governments, for example by giving universities the ability to manage themselves financially. Universities in Europe are largely publicly funded (75 %) amidst efforts to <b>diversify</b> <b>funding.</b> Yet funding is also highly controversial in the public policy debate.|$|R
