25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{moved from}} Philips to RCA Victor during 1967. She sang [...] "Backlash Blues", written by {{her friend and}} Harlem Renaissance leader, Langston Hughes, on her first RCA album, Nina Simone Sings the Blues (1967). On Silk & Soul (1967), she {{recorded}} Billy Taylor's [...] "I Wish I Knew How <b>It</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Feel</b> to Be Free" [...] and [...] "Turning Point". The album 'Nuff Said! (1968) contains live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, {{three days after the}} assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang [...] "Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)", a song written by her bass player, Gene Taylor, directly after the news of King's death had reached them. In the summer of 1969, she performed at the Harlem Cultural Festival in Harlem's Mount Morris Park.|$|E
500|$|The {{layout of}} the [...] long {{anti-clockwise}} track was revealed on 17 October. Nelson Piquet Jr. felt {{it would be a}} fast circuit because it was purpose-built for motor racing and other series had visited the track before. He described it as seeming like it would be slightly wider and easier along with relying less on driver skill and making competitive racing closer. Heidfeld stated that the track layout would mean the drivers would be challenged on electrical energy management and there would a high chance of a full course yellow flag being shown or a safety car being deployed because of the large amount of barriers lining the circuit. José María López, who raced on the track in the WTCC, said it would be [...] "tricky" [...] having been used to touring cars which require more space and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> wider with Formula E vehicles and there would be plenty of space for overtaking manoeuvres.|$|E

5000|$|... "The musicality and songwriting on Pantheion is {{of really}} high quality. It {{is very easy}} to get lost in Crow Black Sky's music and a lot of <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> out of place in an action/fantasy film, {{accompanying}} Tolkien-esque battles or sprawling mountain vistas." ...|$|R
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} and produced {{in one day}} at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, D'Angelo's manager at the time. The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, [...] "the idea was, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like one-on-one with whoever the woman was." [...] D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating [...] "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, she thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When {{she returned to the}} set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up my ankle so bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars saying, [...] "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with {{a pretty good idea of}} what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E

500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
500|$|Orci said getting Nimoy in {{the film}} was important. [...] "Having him sitting around a camp fire sharing his {{memories}} was never gonna cut it" [...] though, and time travel {{was going to be}} included {{in the film}} from the beginning. Kurtzman added, saying the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers [...] "know how they all died". The writers acknowledged time travel had been overused in the other series, but it served a good purpose in creating a new set of adventures for the original characters before they could completely do away with it in other films. Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the series, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] to have them meet Kirk before they do in the series. Orci and Kurtzman noted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> backward to demonize the Klingons again after they had become heroes in later Star Trek series, and the Romulan presence continues Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in [...] "", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation set in 2368. The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes the first human to ever see a Romulan, [...] "Balance of Terror", served as one of the influences for the film. Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{according}} to Rozelle, [...] "The sensation of what something feels like {{is used to}} describe everything from sensual pleasure to pain and torture. [...] It's a wide range, and your readers have actually experienced only some of those feelings. [...] So {{your job is to}} either make them recall exactly what it feels like when something occurs in your story or, if they haven't experienced it, what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like if they did" [...] [...] Morrell describes a [...] "sensory surround", which when [...] "coupled with drama tugs the reader into [...] story and forces him to keep reading." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{employment}} at Amnesty International made Rowling realise that [...] "imagination is what {{allows us to}} empathise {{with people who have}} suffered horribly and to act on their behalf." [...] The danger of inaction, Rowling said, comes from people who [...] "prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages. They can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.|$|E
5000|$|Zelma Redding, {{the widow}} of Otis Redding, said Bolton's {{performance}} of [...] "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" [...] moved her so much [...] "that it brought tears to my eyes.

5000|$|EXAMPLE: [...] "The sentient creature, in the {{limitation}} of hunger, thirst, etc., is the urge to overcome this limitation and it does overcome it. It feels pain, {{and it is the}} privilege of the sentient nature to feel pain; it is a negation in its self, and the negation is determined as a limitation in its feeling, just because the sentient creature has the feeling of its self, which is the totality that transcends this determinateness it feels it Ought not to feel pain.

5000|$|Allman {{describes}} the band's low and dissonant style as Undercore. His baritone singing style and guitars, Hawkey's synths, Puro's electronic drums and Bost's Z-Tar {{all contribute to}} the band's sound. Allman stated, [...] "We wanted to make something that was transcendental, really rule-defying, and very against the grain and when people listened to it at first, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> just <b>feel</b> very like a sense of foreignness, almost like watching a David Lynch film." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him.

2500|$|... "In My Arms" [...] is a synthpop {{inspired}} song, {{which features}} elements of retro and dance music as well. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about a lover by saying how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> in their arms. [...] "In My Arms" [...] received generally favourable reviews from some music critics, with some praising the lyrics and deeming {{it as one of}} the best tracks on the album. However, some reviewers were critical towards the production of the song. Commercially, [...] "In My Arms" [...] was generally successful, peaking inside the top ten in countries including Romania, Belgium, France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. However, the song experienced lower success in her native Australia, where it peaked at thirty-five, becoming her lowest charting single of the decade since [...] "Cowboy Style".|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like we were more in a band".|$|E

2500|$|Sandé {{said she}} wanted her music {{to be remembered as}} that of Nina Simone, one of her {{favourite}} artists.

She also said [...] "These days nothing lasts, music is like fast food, you're in then you're out. She said, as much as she would like, she would never play the piano as well as Simone, but she would give it her best shot. She loves the songs Simone produced, including [...] "I Wish I Knew How <b>It</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Feel</b> to Be Free" [...] and Simone's version of [...] "I Think It's Going to Rain Today". She said that Simone's original songs are very poetic and she said [...] "So when I listen to commercial stuff at the moment, I'm just thinking 'haven't you heard Nina Simone, haven't you heard how a song should be written?" [...] She went on to say [...] "We choose and consume, feast and forget, then rush on to the next hot thing. There's no point chasing that kind of success because it's so transient. Far better to follow (our) own paths and be true to (ourselves)." ...|$|E

Drew Goddard pitched a new Daredevil film to Marvel, but Marvel was not looking to create an R-rated film, and Goddard did not want a [...] "watered down version" [...] of the character, as he also explained in 2015: [...] "I went into Marvel and talked to them about making it as a movie {{a couple of years}} ago, long after the Affleck movie. But what we all sort of realised is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200 million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's just keeping his corner clean. So <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> wrong to have spaceships crashing {{in the middle of the}} city. But because of that, Marvel on the movie side is not in the business of making $25 million movies. They're going big, as they should."

Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows? It certainly doesn't seem like it's on the tip of anyone's lips, but I could have said the same thing - and in fact, I did say the same thing - about Faith No More, and that happened.
