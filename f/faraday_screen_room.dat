We apply Faraday tomography to a radio polarization dataset that we obtained with the WSRT. We developed a new method to calculate a linear fit to periodic data, which we use to determine rotation measures from our polarization angle data. From simulations of a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> + noise we could determine how compatible the data are with <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens.</b> Results. An unexpectedly large fraction of 14 % of the lines-of-sight in our dataset show an unresolved main component in the Faraday depth spectrum. For lines-of-sight with a single unresolved component we demonstrate that a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> in front of a synchrotron emitting region that contains a turbulent magnetic field component can explain the data...|$|R
40|$|We use the {{observed}} polarisation properties {{of a sample}} of 26 powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars to constrain the conditions in the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> local to the sources. We adopt the cosmological redshift, low-frequency radio luminosity and physical size of the large-scale radio structures as our `fundamental' parameters. We find no correlation of the radio spectral index {{with any of the}} fundamental parameters. The observed rotation measure is also independent of these parameters. The difference between the rotation measures of the two lobes of an individual source as well as the dispersion of the rotation measure show significant correlations with the source redshift, but not with the radio luminosity or source size. Thus the small-scale structure observed in the rotation measure is caused by a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> local to the sources. The observed asymmetries between the lobes of our sources show no significant trends with each other or other source properties. Finally, we show that the commonly used model for the depolarisation of synchrotron radio emission by foreground <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> is inconsistent with our observations. We apply alternative models to our data and show that they require a strong increase of the dispersion of the rotation measure inside the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> with cosmological redshift. Correcting our observations with these models for redshift effects, we find a strong correlation of the depolarisation measure with redshift and a significantly weaker correlation with radio luminosity. All our results are consistent with a decrease in the order of the magnetic field structure of the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> local to the sources for increasing cosmological redshift.

40|$|Abridged) We {{conducted}} new 6 cm and 11 cm {{observations of}} CTA 1 using the Urumqi 25 -m and Effelsberg 100 -m telescopes. Data at other wavelengths were included {{to investigate the}} spectrum and polarisation properties. We obtained new total intensity and polarisation maps at 6 cm and 11 cm with angular resolutions of 9. 5 arcmin and 4. 4 arcmin, respectively. We derived a spectral index of alpha=- 0. 63 +/- 0. 05 based on the integrated flux densities at 408 MHz, 1420 MHz, 2639 MHz, and 4800 MHz. The spectral index map calculated from data at the four frequencies shows a clear steepening of the spectrum from the strong shell emission towards the north-western breakout region with weak diffuse emission. The decrease of the spectral index is up to about 0. 3. The RM map derived from polarisation data at 6 cm and 11 cm shows a sharp transition between positive RMs in the north-eastern and negative RMs in the south-western part of the SNR. We note a corresponding RM pattern of extragalactic sources and propose {{the existence of a}} large-diameter <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> in front of CTA 1, which covers the north-eastern part of the SNR. The RM of the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> is estimated to be about + 45 rad/m 2.

40|$|Multi-frequency {{polarimetry}} {{with the}} Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) telescope has revealed absolute Faraday Rotation Measures (RMs) {{in excess of}} 1000 rad m − 2 in the central regions of 7 out of 8 strong quasars studied (e. g., 3 C 273, 3 C 279, 3 C 395). Beyond a projected distance of ∼ 20 pc, however, the jets are found to have |RM | < 100 rad m − 2. Such sharp RM gradients cannot be produced by cluster or galactic-scale magnetic fields, but rather must {{be the result of}} magnetic fields organized over the central 1 – 100 pc. The RMs of the sources studied to date and the polarization properties of BL Lacs, quasars and galaxies are shown to be consistent so far with the predictions of unified schemes. The direct detection of high RMs in these quasar cores can explain the low fractional core polarizations usually observed in quasars at centimeter wavelengths as the result of irregularities in the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> on scales smaller than the telescope beam. Variability in the RM of the core is reported for 3 C 279 between observations taken 1. 5 years apart, indicating that the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> changes on that timescale, or that the projected superluminal motion of the inner jet components samples a new location in the screen with time. Either way, these changes in the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> may explain the dramatic variability in core polarization properties displayed by quasars.

40|$|Polarization {{observations}} at 21 cm and 18 cm {{towards the}} local Taurus molecular cloud complex {{were made with}} the Effelsberg 100 -m telescope. Highly structured, frequency-dependent polarized emission features were detected. We discuss polarization minima with excessive rotation measures located at the boundaries of molecular clouds. The multi-frequency polarization data have been successfully modeled by considering magneto-ionic <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> at {{the surface of the}} molecular clouds. Faraday rotated background emission adds to foreground emission towards these screens in a different way than in its surroundings. The physical size of the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> is of the order of 2 pc for 140 pc distance to the Taurus clouds. Intrinsic rotation measures between about - 18 rad/m 2 to - 30 rad/m 2 are required to model the observations. Depolarization of the background emission is quite small (compatible with zero), indicating a regular magnetic field structure with little turbulence within the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens.</b> With observational constraints for the thermal electron density from H-alpha observations of less than 0. 8 cm^- 3 we conclude that the regular magnetic field strength along the line of sight exceeds 20 muG. We discuss some possibilities for the origin of such strong and well ordered magnetic fields. The modeling also predicts a large-scale, regularly polarized emission in the foreground of the Taurus clouds which is of the order of 0. 24 K at 21 cm. This amount of synchrotron emission is clearly excessive when compared to previous estimates of the local synchrotron emissivity.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the imprint of}} Faraday rotation on radio spectra {{can be used to}} determine the geometry of radio sources and the strength and structure of the surrounding magnetic fields. We model spectra of Stokes Q and U for frequencies between 200 MHz and 10 GHz for <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> with large-scale or small-scale magnetic fields external to the source. These sources can be uniform or 2 D Gaussians on the sky with transverse linear gradients in rotation measure (RM), or cylinders or spheroids with an azimuthal magnetic field. At high frequencies the spectra of all these models can be approximated by the spectrum of a Gaussian source; this is independent of whether the magnetic field is large-scale or small-scale. A sinc spectrum in polarized flux density is not a unique signature of a volume where synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. A turbulent <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> with a large field coherence length produces a spectrum which is similar to the spectrum of a partial coverage model. At low and intermediate frequencies, such a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> produces a significantly higher polarized signal than the depolarization model by Burn, as shown by a random walk model of the polarization vectors. We calculate RM spectra for four frequency windows. Sources are strongly depolarized at low frequencies, but RMs can be determined accurately if the sensitivity of the observations is sufficient. Finally, we show that RM spectra can be used to differentiate between turbulent foreground models and partial coverage models. Comment: 20 pages, 15 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|New {{theoretical}} and experimental {{tools are applied}} {{to the analysis of}} ICRF antenna-edge plasma interactions in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) tokamak. A new numerical method for computing the three-dimensional rf sheath voltage distribution is used, and the quantitative predictions of rf sheath theory are compared with measurements of the edge density profile obtained by microwave reflectometry and with titanium impurity concentration data. It is shown that the local density depletion at the antenna is consistent with density pump-out by strong E · B convection into the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen.</b> Modeling of the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> impurity influx shows that the calculated Ti impurity concentration based on this direct influx agrees with the measured concentration for p phasing. It is also shown that screening of impurity neutrals by ionization in the SOL is a large effect and increases with rf power. At high power over many shots, a fraction of the metal impurities migrates around the machine and is deposited on the limiters, providing a secondary source of titanium. The data shows that the central Ti concentration is strongly dependent on antenna phasing. Possible explanations for this phasing dependence are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{results of}} Alfvén wave heating {{experiments}} and {{the characteristics of}} a new regime of runaway discharges found in Tokamak Chauffage Alfvén Brésilien (TCABR) are discussed. Wave excitation was carried out with one module of the antenna system, with and without a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen.</b> Evidence of plasma heating was obtained in both cases, for coupled wave powers up to half of the Ohmic power, approximately, without uncontrollable density rise during the RF pulse. The antenna coupling with the plasma seems to have increased when the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> was removed. (2) The new regime of runaway discharges is produced by initiating the main plasma breakdown without pre-ionization and strongly increasing the neutral gas fuelling {{at the end of the}} current ramp-up phase. Consequently, the plasma cools down substantially and switches to a runaway mode in conditions under which the primary (Dreicer) mechanism is strongly suppressed. This new regime of runaway discharges is characterized by strong enhancement of the relaxation oscillations, which are seen in the Ha and ECE emissions, coupled with large spikes in the line density, loop voltage, bolometer, and other diagnostic signals.

40|$|Abstract. We {{have carried}} out multifrequency radio {{polarisation}} imaging {{of a sample}} of 15 radio galaxies at z> 2 from the MRC/ 1 Jy sample using the VLA. We report here the discovery of large rotation measures (RM) in a considerable fraction of the high redshift radio galaxies. Using {{the difference between the}} RM values of the two radio lobes in each source and statistical arguments, we show that the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> responsible for the RMs {{are most likely to be}} in the vicinity of the radio sources themselves. Four of the 15 galaxies show intrinsic (redshift corrected) RMs in excess of 1000 rad m − 2 with the highest value of ∼ 6000 rad m − 2 in 1138 - 262 at z = 2. 17. These observations suggest that the environments of the radio galaxies at z> 2 have micro gauss magnetic fields correlated over many kpc (> 5 – 10), at least. We have discussed the problems due to the short time available at those redshifts for the various mechanisms, which are believed to generate and correlate strong magnetic fields on large scales, to operate. In particular, we argue that, unlike at low redshifts, cluster cooling flows are unlikely to have a role in forming deep <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> at high redshifts. It is not clear if the dynamo mechanism is capable of generating such fields in the ambient medium around the radio sources. It appears plausible that condensates of magnetised plasma (galactic or subgalactic sized) are the deep <b>Faraday</b> <b>screens</b> responsible for the observed RMs. We suggest that plasma clumps of as small as 10 9 M ⊙ in the path of the radio jet may generate very large RMs. The presence of such strong and large scale magnetic fields in the medium around the radio sources at such early epochs poses a considerable challenge to models of the origin of magnetic fields in the Universe...|$|R
40|$|The {{depolarization}} asymmetry seen in double-lobed radio sources, {{referred to}} as the Laing-Garrington (L-G) effect where more rapid depolarization is seen in the lobe with no visible jet as the wavelength increases, can be explained either by internal differences between the two lobes, or by an external <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> that lies in front of only the depolarized lobe. If the jet one-sidedness is due to relativistic beaming the depolarization asymmetry must be due to an intervening <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen.</b> If it is intrinsic the depolarization asymmetry must be related to internal differences in the lobes. For a random viewing angle distribution, which must be the case here where un-beamed lobe radiation dominates, jet one-sidedness is unrelated to viewing angle and therefore cannot be used either to estimate the viewing angle or to imply beaming. The outflow speed in the kpc jet is notoriously difficult to determine. However, although it has not yet been proven conclusively, we assume in this paper that the speed in the outer jet of several Fanaroff-Riley Class 1 (FRI) sources exhibiting the L-G effect is close to the 0. 1 c reported by several other investigators. For these sources we find that the jet one-sidedness cannot be explained by beaming and therefore must be intrinsic. In these FRI sources the L-G effect must be due to differences that originate inside the lobes themselves, with the outer regions of the relevant lobe acting as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen.</b> Although it is not known if the flow in the outer jets of FRII sources also slows to this speed it is suggested that the explanation of the L-G effect {{is likely to be the}} same in both types. This argument is strengthened by the recent evidence that FRII galaxies have very large viewing angles, which in turn implies that the L-G model cannot work regardless of the jet velocity. It may therefore be too soon to completely rule out internal depolarization in the lobes as the true explanation for the L-G effect. 9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for measuring the magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies via Faraday rotation of background polarised sources. The populations of clusters and radio sources are derived from an analytical cosmological model, combined with an extrapolation of current observational constraints. We adopt an empirical model for the <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen</b> in individual clusters, gauged to observations of nearby clusters and extrapolate the polarisation properties for the radio source population from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. We find that about 10 per cent of the sky is covered by a significant extragalactic <b>Faraday</b> <b>screen.</b> Most of it has rotation measures between 10 and 100 rad m − 2. We argue that the cluster centres should have up to about 5000 rad m − 2. We show that the proposed mid frequency aperture array of the SKA as well as the lowest band of the SKA dish array are well suited to make measurements for most of these rotation measure values, typically requiring a signal-to-noise of ten. We calculate the spacing of sources forming a grid for the purpose of measuring foreground rotation measures: it reaches a spacing of 36 arcsec for a 100 hour SKA observation per field.
