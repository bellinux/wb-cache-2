6000|$|My Lords, {{very soon}} after these {{appointments}} were made, consisting of Munny Begum {{at the head}} of the affairs, the Lord Chief-Justice under her, and under her direction, and Rajah Gourdas as steward of the household, the first thing we hear is, just what your Lordships expect to hear upon such a case, that this unfortunate chief-justice, who was a man undoubtedly of but a poor, low disposition, but, I believe, a perfectly honest, perfectly well-intentioned man, found it absolutely impossible for him to execute his office under the direction of Munny Begum; and accordingly, in the month of September following, he sends a complaint to Mr. Hastings, [...] "that certain bad men had gained an ascendency over the Nabob's temper, by whose instigation he acts." [...] After complaining of the slights he receives from the Nabob, he adds, [...] "Thus they cause the Nabob to treat me, sometimes with indignity, at others with kindness, just as they think proper to advise him: their view is, that, by compelling me to displeasure at such unworthy treatment, they may force me either to relinquish my station, or to join with them, and act by their advice, and appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices, from which they might draw profit to themselves." [...] This is followed by another letter, in which he shows who those corrupt men were that had gained the ascendency over the Nabob's temper,--namely, the eunuchs of Munny Begum: one of them her <b>direct</b> <b>instrument</b> in bribery with Mr. Hastings. What you would expect from such a state of things accordingly happened. Everything in the course of justice was confounded; all official responsibility destroyed; and nothing but a scene of forgery, peculation, and knavery of every kind and description prevailed through the country, and totally disturbed all order and justice in it. He says, [...] "The Begum's ministers, before my arrival, with the advice of their counsellors, caused the Nabob to sign a receipt, in consequence of which they received at two different times near fifty thousand rupees, in the name of the officers of the Adawlut, Foujdarry, &c., from the Company's circar; and having drawn up an account-current in the manner they wished, they got the Nabob to sign it, and then sent it to me." [...] In the same letter he asserts [...] "that these people have the Nabob entirely in their power." ...|$|E

The characteristics of the financial system during the initial stage of the transition sometimes favor relatively <b>direct</b> <b>instruments.</b> At this stage market-based variants of <b>direct</b> <b>instruments</b> may combine the necessary effectiveness in reducing monetary expansion with the need to introduce and stimulate competition in the financial markets.

This compensation is higher if the municipalities activate the unemployed. The most recent reform implied that only certain types of activation lead to increased compensation. To induce municipalities to switch from different kinds of class-room training to more work-related activation, the compensation rate was made dependent on the type of activation. This implied that job training in public or private firms and work practice have a higher compensation rate than if the unemployed is enrolled in e.g. a job search course.

When government spending is restricted, i. e. when a government is {{unable or unwilling to}} finance the required costs for implementing the optimum policy, subsidies that directly affect investment incentives may generate higher welfare effects than the <b>direct</b> <b>instrument,</b> which is a production subsidy. The driving mechanism is that an investment subsidy may be more cost effective than the direct instrument; and that the relative welfare gain from cost effectiveness can exceed the welfare loss from introducing new distortions. Moreover, it is found that the investment subsidy is gradually phased out of the welfare maximizing policy, which may be a policy combining the two subsidies, when the level of government spending is increased.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and quality of}} housing is very {{closely related to the}} development in the building industry and to the economic opportunities in the given state. This thesis deals with the relationship between tax policy and new housing construction. Taking influence on the building industry through tax policies - that is to say, through indirect instruments - is particularly advantageous thanks to the low administrative overhead, as no further redistribution from public budgets is necessary. Hiding behind this advantage, though, are a number of difficult-to-estimate quantifications in the form of tax allowances or, conversely, of the amount of the tax burden. Indirect instruments can influence residential development activities in both positive and negative ways, and this thesis addresses both. Aside from tax instruments, the state may support new housing construction through <b>direct</b> <b>instruments,</b> a term which covers various forms of loans at preferential terms, grants and subsidies. The aim of this thesis is to test the hypothesis about the effectiveness of housing policy in terms of housing construction through <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Active {{labor market}} {{programs}} (ALMPs) {{are used to}} reduce the risk of unemployment and to increase the earnings capacity of workers. Particular interventions include job search assistance, training, public works, wage and employment subsidies, and self-employment assistance. These programs are implemented to enhance labor supply (e. g., training); increase labor demand (e. g., public works, subsidies); and improve the functioning of the labor market (e. g., employment services). ALMPs are often targeted to the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. OECD countries, in particular, have a long and extensive experience with ALMPs. These programs are becoming more relevant in developing and transition countries, too, as many governments grapple with growing unemployment and underemployment problems. How much reliance should countries place on active labor market programs? This is a controversial question.

Our {{results show that the}} incentives for the government to relax the self-selection constraint and to increase the employment among the low-skilled reinforce each other in terms of marginal income taxation; both of them contribute to increase the marginal income tax rate implemented for the low-ability type and decrease the marginal income tax rate implemented for the high-ability type. The appearance of equilibrium unemployment also constitutes an incentive to implement a tax on outsourcing. Without a <b>direct</b> <b>instrument</b> for taxing outsourcing, the government may reduce the amount of resources spent on outsourcing by increased provision of the public input good, which leads to less wage inequality and increased employment. outsourcing, optimal nonlinear taxation, public goods, unemployment...|$|E
40|$|This paper deals whit the {{dynamics}} of the Catalan textile labour market (the Spanish region that concentrated most of the industrial and factory activity during the 19 Century) and offers hypotheses and results on the impact it had on living standards and fertility levels. We observe the formation of an uneven labour market in which male supply for labour (excluding women and children) grew much faster than the demand. We stress the fact that labour supply is very dependant on institutional factors liked to the transmition of household property between generations. Instead the slow path of growth of adult males demand for labour is witnessing the limits of this industry to expand and to compete in international markets. The strategy of working class families to adapt to scarce opportunities of employment we document here is the diminution of legitimate fertility levels.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} {{on the role of}} the impact of taxes on energy {{production}} versus tariffs on imported goods for trade, energy demand, and welfare. For this, we develop a structural Eaton-Kortum type general equilibrium model of international trade which includes an energy sector. We estimate the key parameters of that model and calibrate it to domestic prices and production using data for 34 OECD countries and the rest of the world in the average year between 2000 and 2005. The model helps understanding the interplay between country-specific energy productivity, energy demand, and trade. The energy sector turns out to be an important determinant of the size of welfare gains from trade liberalization. We find that general import tariffs can be an effective instrument to reduce energy demand. For small open economies, taxing imports as an indirect instrument may be even preferable to taxing energy as a <b>direct</b> <b>instrument</b> from a welfare perspective, if countries pursue the goal of reducing energy demand to a specific extent. This is not the case for large countries such as the United States. Calibrated general equilibrium analysis; Energy demand; International trade; Structural model estimation...|$|E

To investigate {{the effect of}} policy switch from the period of <b>direct</b> <b>instrument</b> to the period of deregulation occasioned by SAP of 1986, we proceed to bifurcate the sample period into two, comprising the period of direct instruments of monetary policy, 1960 – 1985 and the period of indirect instruments of monetary policy, 1986 – 2008. Estimates from a vector auto regression model (VAR) of key macroeconomic variables demonstrate the weak link between money supply and inflation in the both time horizons, {{which suggests that the}} hypothesis that money supply is not an effective policy instrument for management of inflationary developments cannot be rejected for Nigeria. The results further suggest that in both time horizons, exchange rate has been identified as a singular most promising macroeconomic fundamental for both internal and external sectors adjustments.
