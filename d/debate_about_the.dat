The extension of the Yonge line along University Avenue, and the east-west Bloor–Danforth line extension were authorized on September 5, 1958 by the Ontario Municipal Board which sought a compromise between the involved communities.|$|E

5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is ongoing <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> status of the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage.

5|$|The single-origin {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and a method to track down prey after a bite. These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> definition of venom and venomous snakes.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{exact nature}} of phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction.

All of these can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E
