25|$|Cartan's {{approach}} {{seems at}} first to be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. They have many applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames, Cartan connection applications and Einstein–Cartan theory for some examples.|$|E

500|$|This {{conceptualisation}} of the Wake as a {{dream is}} a point of contention for some. Harry Burrell, representative of this view, argues that [...] "one of the most overworked ideas is that Finnegans Wake is about a dream. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> there is no dreamer." [...] Burrell argues that the theory is an easy way out for [...] "critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search for some kind of understanding of it." [...] The point upon which a number of critics fail to concur with Burrell's argument is its dismissal of the testimony of the book's author on the matter as [...] "misleading... publicity efforts". Parrinder, equally skeptical of the concept of the Wake as a dream, argues that Joyce {{came up with the idea}} of representing his linguistic experiments as a language of the night around 1927 as a means of battling his many critics, further arguing that [...] "since it cannot be said that neologism is a major feature of the dreaming process, such a justification for the language of Finnegans Wake smacks dangerously of expediency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shusterman’s {{account of}} {{interpretation}} is constructed {{in opposition to}} both analytic aesthetics and deconstruction, which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it {{with the intention of}} the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.|$|E
2500|$|Religious {{violence}} and persecution continued {{during the reign}} of the two significant Lodhi dynasty rulers, Bahlul Khan Lodhi and Sikandar Lodhi. The Delhi Sultanate, whose reach had shrunk to northern and eastern India, witnessed the burning and killing of Hindus for their religion, in Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In 1499, a Brahmin of Bengal was arrested because he had attracted a large following among both Muslims and Hindus with the following teaching: [...] "the Mohammedan and Hindu religions were both true, and were but different paths by which God might be approached." [...] Sikandar, with his governor of Bihar Azam Humayun, asked Islamic scholars and sharia experts of their time whether such pluralism and peaceful messages were permissible within the Islamic Sultanate. The scholars advised that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> that the Brahmin should be given the option to either embrace and convert to Islam, or be killed. Sikandar accepted the counsel and gave the Brahmin an ultimatum. The Hindu refused to change his view and was killed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} filed {{its opening}} brief November 6, 2012 in Hedges v. Obama before the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government {{stated that the}} plaintiffs lack standing because they've never been detained and face no threat of detention. In its brief the government also criticized Judge Forrest for her interpretation of the term [...] "associated forces". [...] "The term is well understood to cover cobelligerent groups that fight together with al-Qaeda or Taliban forces in the armed conflict against the United States," [...] and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> cannot be [...] "read to cover the types of unarmed advocacy organizations involved in this suit," [...] the defendants said. They also noted {{that none of the}} plaintiffs allege having a fear of detention, nor have they offered any evidence of the U.S. military detaining journalists or advocates. [...] "There is no actual or imminent injury to be redressed," [...] the brief said. The defendants added that there is no precedent for hearing a lawsuit to block the president in advance from conducting an armed conflict using congressionally conferred authority. The government also argued that war authorizations have historically been broad and that section 1021(b)(2) is more specific than other authorizations, therefore it should not be subject to a First Amendment or due process vagueness challenge.|$|E
