50|$|<b>Euromethod</b> {{consisted}} of three books: a reference manual, a dictionary {{and a collection of}} annexes. Euromethodâ€™s first release was in 1996. Although <b>Euromethod</b> is a technically sound method it was never widely known or used.|$|E

50|$|<b>Euromethod</b> was {{a method}} for {{managing}} procurement processes of Information Services. It focuses on contract management.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 the European Commission, main {{supporter}} of the <b>Euromethod</b> project, launched a new programme called SPRITE-S2. As {{a result of this}} programme ISPL was created.|$|E
50|$|ISPL is {{developed}} {{and published in}} 1999 by a consortium of five European companies: EXIN and ID Research (ORDINA) from the Netherlands, FAST from Germany, SEMA from France and TIEKE from Finland. The development of ISPL {{was part of the}} SPRITE-S2 programme that was launched in 1998 by the European Commission. ISPL is derived from <b>Euromethod</b> and based on the research of about 200 real-life acquisitions.|$|E
40|$|In version 0 of <b>Euromethod,</b> method {{bridging}} is {{the procedure}} in which method suppliers describe their methods {{in a uniform}} terminology and format, so that different suppliers can use these descriptions to populate delivery plans with the deliverable profiles related to their method. Customers are then expected {{to be able to}} compare delivery plans written by different suppliers written in the same formast, but using different methods. A description in <b>Euromethod</b> terminology of a deliverable as produced by a method, independent from any delivery plan, is called a method product profile. In this report, the method bridging procedure as well as the structure of method product profiles are analyzed critically. It is argued that customers cannot and sometimes will not perform method bridging as prescribed by <b>Euromethod</b> version 0. Customers are either not interested in the methods and techniques used by the suppliers, or they are, but in that case they are likely to prescribe a method to the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In the IS area, {{methods have}} been focused mostly on IS {{development}} and less on its acquisition. In this last issue, we can find simple methods which give generic advises or series of steps on the acquisition of software, hardware and related services and, on the other hand, some very complex methods, as the <b>Euromethod.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} {{companies}} in the software domain use subcontractors or work as subcontractors to provide pieces of a system solution. In this context it has become crucial to select a subcontractor based on the maturity and competence. The result of this work shall help answer the question: "How does one select a software vendor?". There exist a number of acquisition approaches and frameworks including acquisition approaches, such as SW-CMM, SA-CMM, ISO- 15504 (aka SPICE), ISO- 9000, <b>EuroMethod,</b> IEEE- 1062 and some more minor ones. These documents were analyzed and compared. This work provides two results: A comparison of the approaches discussed from a practical {{point of view and}} a method built upon the existing frameworks and methods. This is the first version of a complete second-generation approach. This method is callled MASS...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the basic elements}} of a risk management method supplementing a number of different public domain approaches, such as PRM body of knowledge from Project Management Institute, CTC from the Software Engineering Institute, the <b>Euromethod</b> strategy model, those described by McFarlan, Archibald, and others. Although the SAFE method originated in the field of information and communication technology, it may easily be extended to other domains of application. It encourages the Project Manager to gain as complete an awareness as possible of the individual, meaningful causes of risk for a specific project, by examining general and particular checklists, and by using creative group techniques and interaction. The risk definition phase is followed by a phase to plan and carry out intervention aimed at reducing the likelihood that damaging events will occur, or the extent of the expected damage. In any case, the point of arrival is the awareness that each profitable enterprise co [...] ...|$|E
