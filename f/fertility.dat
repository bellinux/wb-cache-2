5|$|Private {{hospitals}} specialised {{in different}} areas from plastic surgery to <b>fertility</b> treatments operate in Aarhus as well. Ciconia Aarhus Private Hospital founded in 1984 is a leading Danish <b>fertility</b> clinic and {{the first of its}} kind in Denmark. Ciconia has provided for the birth of 6,000 children by artificial insemination and continually conducts research into the field of <b>fertility.</b> Aagaard Clinic, established in 2004, is another private <b>fertility</b> and gynaecology clinic which since 2004 has undertaken <b>fertility</b> treatments that has resulted in 1550 births. Aarhus Municipality also offers a number of specialised services in the areas of nutrition, exercise, sex, smoking and drinking, activities for the elderly, health courses and lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fertility</b> {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary <b>fertility</b> signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called <b>fertility</b> monitors.|$|E
5|$|The latest Sample Registration System (SRS) {{statistical}} report shows that West Bengal {{has the lowest}} <b>fertility</b> rate amongst all the other Indian states. West Bengal's total <b>fertility</b> rate was 1.6, way below Bihar's 3.4, which is {{the highest in the}} entire country. Bengal's TFR of 1.6 roughly equals that of Canada.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} surround Iðunn, including potential links to <b>fertility,</b> and her potential origin in Proto-Indo-European religion. Long {{the subject of}} artworks, Iðunn is sometimes referenced in modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a <b>fertility</b> signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of <b>fertility</b> in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|According to 2012 Census report, 99.7% of the {{population}} is of African origin. Official <b>fertility</b> rates over the last decade were 3.6 (2002 Census), 3.8 (2006) and 3.8 (2012 Census).|$|E
5|$|Agriculturalecosystemsfunction {{effectively}} as self-regulating systems provided they have sufficient biodiversity {{of plants and}} animals.

5|$|As per the census, Zambia {{recorded}} a Total <b>fertility</b> rate (TFR), {{defined as the}} <b>fertility</b> rate of a woman throughout her life, of 5.9, with 7.0 in rural and 4.6 in urban areas. The most urbanized provinces, with higher socio-economic index like Lusaka {{recorded a}} lower TFR. Crude birth rate (CBR), the number of live births for each 1,000 births, stood at 35 in Zambia, with the Northern Province recording a maximum of 41. Child-woman ratio (CWR), the ratio of children aged 0–4 against women aged 15–49, was 738 children per thousand women and it was maximum in Northern province, where it was 880. The General <b>fertility</b> rate (GFR), the number of births per 1,000 child bearing women, was 147 as per the census. The Completed family Size (CF) was 6.4 in rural areas and 5.4 in urban areas. Gross reproduction rate (GRR), {{the average number of}} females births a women would have between ages 15–49, was 2.3, while the Net reproduction rate (NRR), the number of surviving female births a women would have between ages 15–49, stood at 2.1.|$|E
5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} <b>fertility</b> gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local <b>fertility</b> cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta's {{serpentine}} ornaments indicate asceticism {{while her}} youthful nude ornamented body has erotic overtones. Like all Hindu goddesses, she is decked in gold finery, symbol {{of wealth and}} <b>fertility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freyja, {{the goddess}} of love, beauty, and <b>fertility</b> in Norse mythology, is {{depicted}} as riding a chariot drawn by cats.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, the phallus is also {{considered}} to be a symbol of good luck and representative of <b>fertility.</b> There are numerous shrines in the country featuring phallic architecture. Chao Mae Tuptim shrine in Bangkok, behind the Swissôtel Bangkok hotel has over a hundred colored circumcised wooden penis statues of all shapes and sizes which are said to possess special cosmic powers and endow good fortune and <b>fertility</b> on anybody coming into contact with them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{queenless}} ant Streblognathus peetersi, policing {{helps to}} select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered <b>fertility,</b> enabling high-ranking workers {{to take over}} as new gamergates.|$|E
5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the figure with <b>fertility.</b> In the past locals would erect a maypole on the earthwork, around which childless couples would dance to promote <b>fertility.</b> According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and infertility may be cured through sexual intercourse {{on top of the}} figure, especially the phallus.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies have}} {{examined}} possible links with atopy and exposure to infection early in life, use of hormones and <b>fertility</b> drugs, and maternal use of hair dye.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{containing}} phytoestrogens {{have been}} administered for centuries for gynaecological {{disorders such as}} <b>fertility,</b> menstrual, and menopausal problems. Among these plants are Pueraria mirifica, kudzu, angelica, fennel, and anise.|$|E
5|$|Plants may spread clonally {{through the}} {{production}} of daughter bulbs and division producing clumps. Narcissus species hybridise readily, although the <b>fertility</b> of the offspring {{will depend on the}} parental relationship.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve <b>fertility.</b> These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their <b>fertility</b> and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|The total <b>fertility</b> rate (TFR) in Scotland {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate <b>fertility</b> during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of <b>fertility</b> when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of its age, the Cerne Abbas Giant {{has become}} an {{important}} part of local culture and folklore, which often associates it with <b>fertility.</b> It is one of England's best known hill figures and is a visitor attraction in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded <b>fertility</b> reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, <b>fertility</b> reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
25|$|Chhattisgarh has {{a fairly}} high <b>fertility</b> rate (3.1) as {{compared}} to All India (2.6) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has rural <b>fertility</b> rate of 3.2 and urban <b>fertility</b> rate of 2.1.|$|E
25|$|The Christian <b>fertility</b> {{rate has}} varied {{throughout}} history, {{as with other}} <b>fertility</b> figures. The Christian <b>fertility</b> rate also varies from country to country. In the 20-year period from 1989–2009, the average world <b>fertility</b> rate decreased from 3.50 to 2.58, a fall of 0.92 children per women, or 26%. The weighted average <b>fertility</b> rate for Christian nations decreased {{in the same period}} from 3.26 to 2.58, a fall of 0.68 children per women, or 21%. The weighted average <b>fertility</b> rate for Muslim nations decreased in the same period from 5.17 to 3.23, a fall of 1.94 children per women, or 38%. While Muslims have an average of 3.1 children per woman—the highest rate of all religious groups. Christians are second, with 2.7 children per woman.|$|E
25|$|Competition among <b>fertility</b> clinics {{does not}} appear to {{increase}} rates of multiple births from <b>fertility</b> treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of lowest-low <b>fertility,</b> defined as total <b>fertility</b> below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed {{by many to}} postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total <b>fertility</b> (a very low 1.1 in 2001), {{was one of the}} world's lowest, shows that {{there is more than one}} pathway to lowest-low <b>fertility.</b> Although Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991–2004, it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that <b>fertility</b> declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early <b>fertility</b> pattern. These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early <b>fertility</b> and early marriage.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{information}} about <b>fertility</b> awareness was only available from Catholic sources. The first secular teaching organization was the <b>Fertility</b> Awareness Center in New York, founded in 1981. Toni Weschler started teaching in 1982 and published the bestselling book Taking Charge of Your <b>Fertility</b> in 1995. Justisse {{was founded in}} 1987 in Edmonton, Canada. These secular organizations all teach symptothermal methods. Although the Catholic organizations are significantly larger than the secular <b>fertility</b> awareness movement, independent secular teachers have become increasingly common since the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The total <b>fertility</b> {{rate of the}} Faroe Islands is {{currently}} {{one of the highest}} in Europe. The <b>fertility</b> rate is 2.409 children born per woman (2015 est.).|$|E
25|$|<b>Fertility</b> {{tourism is}} the {{practice}} of traveling to another country for <b>fertility</b> treatments. It may {{be regarded as a}} form of medical tourism. The main reasons for <b>fertility</b> tourism are legal regulation of the sought procedure in the home country, or lower price. In-vitro fertilization and donor insemination are major procedures involved.|$|E
25|$|The current Russian total <b>fertility</b> rate is 1.7 {{children}} per woman. While {{this represents}} an increase over previous rates, it remains sub-replacement <b>fertility,</b> below the replacement rate of 2.10 - 2.14.|$|E
25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of <b>fertility</b> are basal body {{temperature}} (BBT), cervical mucus, and cervical position. A woman practicing symptoms-based <b>fertility</b> awareness {{may choose to}} observe one sign, two signs, or all three. Many women experience secondary <b>fertility</b> signs that correlate with certain phases of the menstrual cycle, such as abdominal pain and heaviness, back pain, breast tenderness, and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains).|$|E
25|$|To the Egyptians, {{the frog}} {{was a symbol}} of life and <b>fertility,</b> since {{millions}} of them were born after the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought <b>fertility</b> to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented <b>fertility,</b> named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, or a woman with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog {{on the end of a}} phallus to explicitly indicate her association with <b>fertility.</b> A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown in the form of a frog.|$|E
25|$|While {{the total}} <b>Fertility</b> Rate of Muslims in North America is 2.7 {{children}} per {{woman in the}} 2010 to 2015 period, well above the regional average (2.0) and the replacement level (2.1). Europe’s Muslim population also has higher <b>fertility</b> (2.1) than other religious groups in the region, well above the regional average (1.6). A new study of Population Reference Bureau by demographers Charles Westoff and Tomas Frejka suggests that the <b>fertility</b> gap between Muslims and non-Muslims is shrinking and although the Muslim immigrants do have more children than other Europeans but their <b>fertility</b> tends to decline over time, often faster than among non-Muslims.|$|E
25|$|The {{delay in}} <b>fertility</b> becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay {{childbirth}} past their <b>fertility</b> peak. Since <b>fertility</b> peaks {{at a certain}} age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women {{will be able to}} have children. The media has been an influence on women's <b>fertility</b> choices: popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they themselves will also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fertility</b> rate {{fell from}} 5.00 in 1971 to 1.75 in 2004. <b>Fertility</b> rates vary {{considerably}} {{among the different}} religious groups: in 2004 it was 2.10 for Shiites, 1.76 Sunnis and 1.61 for Maronites.|$|E
