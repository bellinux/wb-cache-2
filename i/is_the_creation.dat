5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> {{of housing}} communities {{at the edges of}} wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for casting the {{individual}} gongs. The first phase <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before {{the availability of}} standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold {{is covered with a}} special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate {{the idea of a}} shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{innovation}} {{initiated by}} a city or a region <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another innovation is {{an association of}} community-based organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of El Valle, Cauca and Risaralda in Southwestern Colombia. It {{began in the late}} 1990s {{with the assistance of the}} Universidad del Valle in Cali in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, operate and maintain their water systems.|$|E
5|$|Adam is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the fourth season of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Portrayed by George Hertzberg, he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: {{the product of a}} perverse experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, Buffy Summers, encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), the head of a military-like organization called The Initiative that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or Big Bad.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as {{it is filled with}} water.|$|E

Citizens of Mysore have criticised MUDA for its inability to prevent land mafias and ensure lawful distribution of housing lands among city residents. The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation is responsible for electric supply to the city.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of her position, Tsunade tends to laze around and avoid her everyday duties, instead leaving them for her assistant Shizune. She does however take her role very seriously in situations where Konoha is in danger, and throughout Part II leads the village in combating the Akatsuki. Tsunade is a compulsive gambler with terrible luck, though with a rare winning streak perceived by her as a bad omen. Despite her odd personality, Tsunade is a highly talented medical ninja who can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable, and also possesses superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble. The pinnacle of her skills <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creation</b> Rebirth and its derived technique, the Strength of a Hundred Technique, which she taught to her disciple Sakura and use mitotic regeneration to make them nearly unkillable in battle. In the Japanese anime, Tsunade's voice actress is Masako Katsuki, and her English voice actress is Debi Mae West. In some of the video games, however, her English voice actress is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.|$|E

5|$|The first divine act <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the cosmos, {{described}} in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, {{each of which}} may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the chaos that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions {{of the events of}} creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos. The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E
