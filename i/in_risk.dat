5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase <b>in</b> <b>risk.</b> Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{confirm the}} {{validity}} of the proposed Hammersmith score, which identifies three risk categories of patients and establish its strength on a large group of 128 chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after being resistant to imatinib. Sixty-one patients were identified as good risk group, 27 patients as intermediate risk group, and 40 patients as poor risk group. The 1 -year cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response was 73 % <b>in</b> good <b>risk</b> patients, 40 % <b>in</b> intermediate <b>risk</b> patients, and 22 % <b>in</b> poor <b>risk</b> patients (P = 0. 0001). Event-free survival at 3 -year was 89 % <b>in</b> good <b>risk</b> group, 70 % in intermediate group, and 54 % <b>in</b> poor <b>risk</b> group (P = 0. 0001); the estimated 3 -year progression-free survival was 95 % <b>in</b> good <b>risk</b> category, 93 % <b>in</b> intermediate <b>risk</b> category, and 87 % <b>in</b> poor <b>risk</b> category (P = 0. 05). Kaplan-Meier estimated that the 3 -year overall survival was 100 % <b>in</b> good <b>risk</b> category, 93 % <b>in</b> intermediate <b>risk</b> category, and 82 % <b>in</b> poor <b>risk</b> category (P = 0. 04). In conclusion, some prognostic factors before starting second-generation TKIs might predict cytogenetic response and outcome. The so-called Hammersmith score was not yet validated in large series of patients: we demonstrated that this score is able to discriminate patients at high risk of failure and consequent progression before treatment with second-generation TKIs...|$|R

5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> as women age.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species may}} be <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, {{which are very}} sensitive to habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E

The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment, previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food <b>in</b> <b>risk</b> zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm {{that it would not}} create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase <b>in</b> <b>risk.</b> Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
