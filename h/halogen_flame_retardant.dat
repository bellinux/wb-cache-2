40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} process for treating natural rubber to increase its flame retardant capability. Theprocess comprises a mixture of a natural rubber with, (a) halogenated free flame retardant agent (zinc hydroxystannate;STORFLAM ZHS) and (b) halogenated flame retardant agent (decabromodiphenyl; Great Lake DE- 83 R and chlorinatedparaffins; Plastoil 152) and another material like antimony trioxide and aluminium hydroxide in appropriate amount, with ratio of halogenated flame retardant agent: antimony trioxide 3 : 1. In the resulting product with <b>halogen</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> showed a more efficient flame retardant property than halogen free flame retardant, i. e. brominated flame retardant provide higher efficiency than chlorinated and ZHS, respectively. The minimum requirement ratio for being flame retardant of antimonytrioxide: brominated or chlorinated agent is 7 : 21 or 10 : 30 phr while aluminium hydroxide: ZHS is 10 : 150 phr. It was found thatburning rate was zero for brominated and chlorinated agent used but not for zinc hydroxyl stannate system. Average time of burning (ATB) was 135, 118 and 41 second for brominated, chlorinated and ZHS flame retardant, respectively. Average extent of burning (AEB) was 24, 19 and 14 millimeters, respectively. An advantage of this invention is that chemicals (antimony trioxide and either brominated or chlorinated agent) added to natural rubber {{have the effect of}} rendering the natural rubber flame-resistant like synthetic rubbers, chloroprene...|$|E

40|$|Management {{of waste}} {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) or e-waste {{is becoming a}} major issue as around 20 to 50 million tonnes such waste is generated worldwide and increasing at a higher rate other solid waste streams. Electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) contains over 1000 materials of which brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (BFRs) such as polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been the target of the regulators forcing manufacturers to adopt <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> As far as these alternatives are concerned key consideration should be its performance during the whole life cycle through design, use and end-of-life management. Global <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> movement has reached a point of no return. The most important issue as far as the environment is concerned, for which the transformation to halogen free retardants was initially targeted, {{is to make sure that}} life span of the EEE using the alternatives to BFRs is not shortened thereby resulting in unforeseen increase in e-waste to deal with. The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental issues and current developments related to the use of BFRs in EEE manufacture. It describes the sources, toxicity and human exposure of BFRs, EOL management such as recycling and thermal treatments, exposure of BFRs from e-waste processing facilities and the environment around them and examines the developments and feasibility of the alternatives to BFR in EEE manufacture.

50|$|The {{tests on}} the fire {{behaviour}} of materials with different <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> revealed that <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> the “design for environment” projects on <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{including}} {{magnesium hydroxide}} (MH) and huntite hydromagnesite (HH) {{were used to}} develop <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> (HFFR) compounds based on ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) for wire and cable applications. Cone calorimeter and limiting oxygen index (LOI) results show that cross-linking affects not only mechanical properties, but also flame retardancy. Consequently, flame retardancy is mainly influenced by type of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and mixing ratio of base polymers {{and to a lesser}} extent by cross-linking. Tensile strength increased with increase of MH, while elongation at break decreased with increase of MH in cross-linked formulations. On the other hand, elongation at break increased with increase of HH while tensile strength decreased with increase of HH in cross-linked formulations. HFFR compounds with tensile strength of 12 MPa, elongation at break of 200 %, LOI of 40 % was developed to meet the stringent specifications of wire and cable industry.

50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{has been studied}} since the 1990s. Mainly brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances {{were found to have}} toxic properties. Therefore, alternatives have been demanded by authorities, NGOs and equipment manufacturers. The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> About a dozen <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS).

40|$|On the one hand, <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (FRs) save {{many lives}} and {{property}} because they prevent accidental fires. On the other hand, {{there are concerns}} related to chemical release into the environment and poten-tial health effects. Since halogenated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{have been in the}} focus of public scrutiny, <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> based on other chemistries like phosphorus and nitrogen have been promoted. However, <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> need to prove their environmental benefits. Rather than using typical global life cycle assessment parameters like energy consumption or global warming potential, a benchmark approach was used: comparing the performance of new flame retar-dants versus currently employed FR systems and also to the non-flame retarded polymer. The poly-mers studied were polyamide (PA) 6, polyamide 6. 6, high temperature nylon (HTN) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). Therefore, the release of <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> and degradation products over key stages of the life cycle of flame retarded plastics was investigated: processing by extrusion, use phase, accidental fires, incineration and end-of-life disposal. Other end-of-life options like feedstock recy-cling, incineration (energy recovery) or landfilling were studied and current waste streams assessed, in order to gain an estimate of the total material mass flows and balance over the life cycle of the <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> In addition, experiments on mechanical recycling were carried out. The authors believe that the methodology presented can be applied to other <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and plas-tics additives in order to evaluate the environmental profile of these products, especially within the context of upcoming European chemicals regulations (REACH 1) and waste regulations for electronic equipment (WEEE 2 and RoHS 3) ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{pressing}} need for substituting several halogenated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> given {{the human and}} environmental health concerns {{of many of these}} compounds. <b>Halogen</b> Free <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants</b> (HFFRs) have been suggested as alternatives and are already being marketed, although their potential impact on the environment cannot be properly assessed {{because of a lack of}} information regarding their environmental and ecotoxicological properties. The aim of this study was to determine the aquatic fate and effects of a selection of HFFRs that are currently being applied in polymers as alternatives of hazardous brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> To this end, we have identified the current state of knowledge on PBT properties of a selection of HFFRs and prioritized those for further research. We have developed analytical methods to determine organophosphorus HFFRs in water. Next, we quantified the aerobic biodegradation of organophosphorus HFFRs. Finally, we assessed the acute and chronic aquatic toxicity of HFFRs to Daphnia magna. Several chapters of this thesis showed the dilemma between the need for data extrapolation with its associated uncertainties and the need for more reliable, though expensive and time consuming, experimental verification. With the growing evidence of unwanted adverse side effects of several HFFRs, we have to carefully balance the direct risk reduction of fire spread against the potential global impact of contaminants on the long term. It is concluded that with the newly obtained insight in the hazards of HFFRs, support is provided for the application of environmentally compatible <b>flame</b> <b>retardants...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fire {{safety issues}} are {{becoming}} increasingly important in modern society and cables are one potential fire risk since they can start and/or spread a fire. As a result of environmental and safety issues {{having to do with}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> based on <b>halogens,</b> much attention has lately been given to finding halogen free alternatives. This work focuses on Casico&# 61668;, a <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> system used primarily for cable applications. It is based on poly(ethylene-co-acrylate), chalk and silicone elastomer. Small scale fire tests, such as oxygen index, cone calorimetry and dripping, analytical studies, such as IR, NMR, ESCA, XRD, SEM and TEM microscopy, and visual observations were used to evaluate materials. An original methodology in which the temperature is measured within cone calorimeter specimens using thermo couples was successfully developed. The flame retardancy of Casico is multifaceted and depends on some simpler factors, such as a volume and dilution effect of inert filler, and other more complex factors, such as the ionomer formation that occurs between acidic groups and calcium ions in the chalk after ester pyrolysis of the acrylate groups, formation and stabilisation of an intumescent structure, and the importance of the surface layer. These factors have successfully been linked to each other and, together with the effect of dispersion and viscosity, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> properties and behaviour of Casico can be explained satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|Radical {{generators}} as synergists in {{flame retarded}} polymers {{have been used}} in combination with brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for decades. However, due to the low thermal stability of radical generators under the usual polymer processing conditions the use was limited to selected applications e. g. in polystyrene foams. The need to find efficient <b>halogen</b> free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> resulted inter alia in the discovery and commercialization of hindered amine light stabilizers based on alkoxyamines (NOR-HALS). NOR-HALS provide flame retardancy of polypropylene and polyolefin fibers, non-wovens and films. The performance of the NOR molecules depends on their structure i. e. the capability to degrade into nitroxyl plus alkyl or aminyl plus alkoxy radicals. Through formation of radicals a fast degradation of the polymer chain is induced and flame retardancy is achieved by removing the substrate from the flame. On the other hand, the formed radicals are involved in the free radical chemical reactions during the combustion process. Furthermore, alkoxy amines can interact with brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and facilitate the release of bromine, consequently increasing the overall FR performance. Therefore, it is possible with NORs to design <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> polyolefin molding compositions with lower levels of halogenated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and, in addition, to eliminate antimony trioxide. Moreover the hindered amine (HALS) structure provides light and long-term thermal stability of flame retarded formulations. Following the success of NOR based <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> a number of alternative radical generator molecules have been identified namely azo compounds, triazenes, hydrazones and azines. Especially combinations of Azo and NOR structures in one molecule show increased performance at loadings as low as 0. 5 % in polypropylene films, including light and long-term thermal stability, and act synergistically with halogen, phosphorus and inorganic <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Although the performance of alkoxyamines in thin sections such as films is well documented and the UL 94 V- 2 classification is often obtained in moldings, formulations usually fail in achieving the UL 94 V- 0 classification as burning drips cannot be avoided despite short burning times. For the first time a new class of nitrogen based radical generators can be presented whereas in combination with selected phosphorus derivatives flame retarded polypropylene with UL 94 V- 0 classification is accessible. Thermal stability and degradation of the new class into radicals is correlated to the molecular structure and can be adjusted in line with the degradation of the polymer and the synergist. Moreover the necessary loadings to achieve UL 94 V- 0 are below 10 %...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> subsumes {{a diverse}} group of {{chemicals}} which are added to manufactured materials, such as plastics and textiles, and surface finishes and coatings. <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> inhibit or delay the spread of fire by suppressing the chemical reactions in the flame or by the formation of a protective layer on the surface of a material. They may be mixed with the base material (additive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants)</b> or chemically bonded to it (reactive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants).</b> Mineral <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are typically additive while organohalogen and organophosphorus compounds can be either reactive or additive.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, {{the world}} {{consumption}} of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{was more than}} 2 million tonnes. The commercially most import application area is the construction sector. It needs <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for instance for pipes and cables made of plastics. In 2008 the United States, Europe and Asia consumed 1.8 million tonnes, worth US$4.20-4.25 billion. According to Ceresana, the market for <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> is increasing due to rising safety standards worldwide and {{the increased use of}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> It is expected that the global <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> market will generate US$5.8 billion. In 2010, Asia-Pacific was the largest market for <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> accounting for approximately 41% of global demand, followed by North America, and Western Europe.|$|R
40|$|The four {{processes}} {{involved in}} the flammability of materials are described and related to the various flame retardance mechanisms that may operate. Following this the four practical approaches used in improving flame retardance of materials are described. Each approach is illustrated {{with a number of}} typical examples of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> or synthetic procedures used. This overview of flammability, flame retardance, and <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> used is followed by a more detailed examination of most of the plastics manufactured in the United States during 1973, their consumption patterns, and the primary types of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> used in the flame retardance of the most used plastics. The main types of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are illustrated with a number of typical commercial examples. Statistical data on <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> market size, <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> growth in plastics, and price ranges of common <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are presented...|$|R
5000|$|... 390,000 tons of {{brominated}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{were sold}} in 2011. This represents 19.7% of the <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> market.|$|R
