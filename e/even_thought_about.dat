5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

The filmmakers <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E

40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} {{is vital for}} effective teaching and teacher wellbeing, so {{there is good reason}} for teachers {{to get in touch with}} their emotions. Sooner or later, all teachers experience some kind of pressure, some form of stress and some level of concern about their performance in the classroom. They may feel that they are not in touch with the innumerable interactions that occur with their students everyday, but some teachers think they ought to be. The feeling of losing touch can lead to a sense of losing control, uncertainty about continuing in the role as a teacher, an inability to feel rewarded by one 2 ̆ 7 s efforts, and <b>even</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> leaving the profession. Those feelings come about because there is a link between emotions and performance. The wellbeing of teachers is a concern for professional development co-ordinator and other school leadership staff, especially if it is evident that teachers are not reacting 2 ̆ 7 normally 2 ̆ 7 to pressures, when they are acting as if they have suppressed their usual feelings of self-efficacy. Teaching is an emotional activity: the highs and lows are a natural result of the many interactions teachers have with students, other teachers, teaching teams, school leaders, administrators and parents. Individual differences exist in the way we handle the many emotions generated in the workplace and, for teachers, these differences have an influence on performance and levels of stress tolerance. The varying individual capacity to handle emotions is called 2 ̆ 7 emotional intelligence. 2 ̆ 7 If schools want to ensure the wellbeing of teachers, leaders need to accept that different individuals have different levels of emotional intelligence, and they need to provide support and professional development for teachers in this area.
