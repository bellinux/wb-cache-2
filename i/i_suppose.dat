5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E

25|$|He {{is seated}} in an armed chair, {{not a very}} common {{convenience}} in a desert, nor a very proper attitude for a preacher; but his hair is greyish which <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> to be an apology for the sitting.|$|E
25|$|The confession-book, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> has disappeared. It is {{twenty years}} since I have seen one. As a boy I told some {{inquisitive}} owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero {{in real life}} and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> {{the day is}} not far distant {{when the}} players will also fly out to Australia, and {{this can be done}} in a week or even less, as {{evidenced}} by the experiences of Cyril Washbrook, Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham, who left home one week and were in Australia the next.|$|E

25|$|This is {{an opera}} for {{children}} because {{it tries to}} recapture my own childhood. You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> no {{one likes}} to be {{compelled}} to exonerate himself from connections he has never acquired. I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E
25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E

25|$|It was his baptism of fire, and I {{have since}} {{wondered}} at the strange caprice which strikes down {{one man in}} his first skirmish and protects another time after time. But <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> all pitchers will get broken in the end. Outwardly I sympathised with my brother in his misfortune, which he mourned bitterly, since it prevented him {{taking part in the}} impending battle, but secretly I confess myself well content that this young gentleman should be honourably out of harm's way for a month.|$|E
500|$|Three promotional {{films were}} made for the song [...] "Rain". These videos, along with other Beatles videos at the time, sparked George Harrison to say during the Beatles Anthology, [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> in a way, we invented MTV." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{originating}} roughly {{simultaneously in}} Holland, England, and France, {{it was only}} in England, and later in Ireland, that the legend became well known and widely believed. In 1861 Charles Dickens remarked on the longevity of the belief in pig-faced women in England, commenting that [...] "In every age, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> there has been a pig-faced lady".|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of Bloch's biography, Murray writes: [...] "Jeremy Thorpe had hoped {{to be remembered as}} a great {{political}} leader. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> they all do.

500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. I have had three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> But they were actually quite rotten and false, abusive to me. What I am doing now is learning to fall in love with myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen of the Daily Mail pondered whether Mercedes sleeps, saying [...] "I can’t {{imagine her}} taking a rest from {{thinking}} about blokes {{long enough to}} enjoy {{a trip to the}} Land of Nod". She added that Mercedes confiding secrets in Doctor Browning [...] "served only to bring them closer. Usually, half a lager is all it takes to induce such a closeness, so <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> we can call it progress".|$|E

500|$|The {{collapse}} of the dam wall {{of one of these}} reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town. The growing population led to the construction of many back-to-back dwellings that, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired George Orwell in 1937 to write: [...] "Sheffield, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World".|$|E
500|$|The song itself recounts {{both the}} plot of the movie, and {{contains}} various in-jokes and references therein. One line about lawyers—"A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawyer/Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that proves they're really not all bad"—was deliberately placed in the song to be ambiguous, as it could either be referring to lawyers or dinosaurs as being [...] "not all bad". The song also makes various pop culture references, mentioning both E tickets and Barney.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} he {{was looking forward to}} playing a good guy in the future he answered: [...] "No. Well, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> for now I'm happy with {{sticking}} to what he is. But after the Potter legacy is over I look forward to playing a good guy, or someone different anyway; someone not so spiteful."
