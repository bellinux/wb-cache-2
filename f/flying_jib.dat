25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and <b>flying</b> <b>jib.</b> All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
500|$|The reverse {{depicts the}} Mayflower under full sail. Numismatic writers have focused much {{attention}} {{on the fact that}} the ship bears a [...] triangular <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> a type of sail not used at the time of the Mayflower voyage. This error was avoided by Clair Aubrey Huston in his design for the one-cent stamp issued on December 21, 1920, for the anniversary. The inscriptions and dates that encircle the coin are self-explanatory.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. John Tilley {{noted that}} [...] "the Massachusetts was a two-masted {{schooner}} of 70 43/95 tons burden, 60 ' in length, with {{a beam of}} 17' 8" [...] and depth of hold of 7' 8". [...] The ship had a long quarterdeck, deep bulwarks, and an armament of either four of six swivel guns. [...] The contract signed by Searle and Tyler called for two boats and seven sails: mainsail, foresail, jib, <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> fore topsail, main topsail, and squaresail." [...] The cutter ended up being larger than originally authorized as her first master, [...] John Foster Williams, ordered an increase in her size without first seeking departmental approval. [...] Her cost was therefore considerably over the original estimate. [...] Nevertheless, the government accepted her as built.|$|E
50|$|Triangular staysails {{set forward}} of the {{foremost}} mast are called jibs, headsails, or foresails. The innermost such sail on a cutter, schooner, and many other rigs having two or more foresails is referred to simply as the staysail, while the others {{are referred to as}} <b>jibs,</b> <b>flying</b> <b>jibs,</b> etc.|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this time}} that both the OROHENA and the Hira, running in close to the shore, began firing guns and {{signalling}} frantically. The three men stepped outside {{in time to see the}} two schooners go hastily about and head off shore, dropping mainsails and <b>flying</b> <b>jibs</b> on the run in the teeth of the squall that heeled them far over on the whitened water. Then the rain blotted them out.|$|R
60|$|Never {{had such}} summons been {{answered}} with more enthusiasm. The calm had broken. The wind had come {{which was to}} carry them south into safety. With a wild cheer all sprang on deck. Working with mad haste, they flung out topsails, <b>flying</b> <b>jibs</b> and stay-sails. As they worked, the fog-bank lifted and the black vault of heaven, bespangled with the old familiar stars, rushed into view. When all was ship-shape, the Mary Thomas was lying gallantly over on her side to a beam wind and plunging ahead due south.|$|R
6000|$|... “’Tis {{the fear}} iv {{death at the}} hearts iv them,” Louis muttered in my ear, as I passed forward to see to taking in the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> and staysail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard {{down with}} your helm!" [...] the captain {{commanded}} the steersman, all the life gone out of his voice. Then to the crew, [...] "Back over the jib and foresail! Run down the <b>flying</b> <b>jib!</b> Clew up the foretopsail! And aft here and swing on to the main-sheet!" ...|$|E
60|$|I HAD scarce {{gained a}} {{position}} on the bowsprit when the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 a {{new design}} which {{differs from the}} earlier design by being 1'-3" [...] longer, having a transom and <b>flying</b> a <b>jib,</b> which was {{designed}} by James (or Maimie) Doyle from Kingstown was introduced. The new design was subject to some minor adjustments of sheer line and rudder size over the years 1901-1902 before the design was finalised.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} it was dark they were pretty well down the water front of the metropolis. A {{consultation}} was held, and it was decided to lower the mainsail and topsail and leave only the <b>jib</b> <b>flying.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mirror {{class rules}} permit {{the use of}} a spinnaker. This may also be used by single handers as well - {{although}} <b>flying</b> a main, <b>jib</b> and spinnaker single-handed sounds complex, it is quite manageable with a bit of practice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Port! hard a port!" [...] cried our sailing-master. [...] "Clew up the topsails! Let the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> run down! Back the jib over to {{windward}} and {{run down the}} foresail!" [...] And so was our schooner Sophie Sutherland hove to off the Japan coast, near Cape Jerimo, on April 10, 1893.|$|E
6000|$|Spike gave a long, low whistle, {{after his}} fashion, {{and he walked}} away from the females, with the air of a man who wanted room to think in. Half a minute later, he called out--"Stand by to shorten sail, boys. Man fore-clew-garnets, <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> down haul, {{topgallant}} sheets, and gaff-topsail gear. In with 'em all, my lads--in with everything, with a will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then get a move on, or we {{may lose}} a stick {{as well as}} a sail," [...] and there {{followed}} a perfect volley of orders in a tone that none of the sailors misunderstood. Up to the yards they crawled like so many monkeys, and soon the creaking of halyard blocks was heard, as the topsails came down. The jib and <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> were also taken in, and a little later the main-course and the mizzen-course.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds and were usually set <b>flying.</b> A storm <b>jib</b> {{was a small}} jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.|$|R
5000|$|Amazing Grace sets {{a square}} topsail on the {{foremast}} and seven {{fore and aft}} sails: gaff main, gaff topsail, main and fore staysails, fisherman staysail, and <b>flying</b> and inner <b>jibs.</b> These {{can be used in}} different combinations to suit the wind conditions. The rigging is complex and logical having evolved over the last two hundred years.|$|R
50|$|The Tancook Schooner, {{with its}} counter stern and {{characteristic}} round or 'spoon' bow was a distinctive type of small sailing work boat built primarily on Big Tancook Island, Nova Scotia and the immediate surrounding area on and near Mahone Bay. The design succeeded the earlier double ended Tancook Whaler fishing boats. The Tancook Schooners were usually {{larger than the}} Tancook Whalers and had fixed keels rather than centerboards. The sail plan for the smaller sizes of transom sterned schooners was typically gaff rigged fore and main and one or sometimes two headsails. After about 1930, marconi mains were common {{and a number of}} the smaller schooners were rigged as knockabouts <b>flying</b> a single <b>jib</b> without a bowsprit keeping the head sail rigging on deck.|$|R
60|$|He {{was quick}} to obey, and I found myself alone {{on the deck of}} the Ghost. As quietly as was possible, I clewed up the topsails, lowered the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> and staysail, backed the jib over, and {{flattened}} the mainsail. Then I went below to Maud. I placed my finger on my lips for silence, and entered Wolf Larsen’s room. He was in the same position in which I had left him, and his head was rocking—almost writhing—from side to side.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Sam to stow {{away the}} stores {{as he saw}} fit, Dick and Tom sprang in to assist Martin Harris, and soon the {{mainsail}} and jib were set, and they {{turned away from the}} dock and began the journey down the Hudson. As soon as they were clear of the other boats, the skipper set his topsail and <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> and they bowled along at a merry gait, the wind being very nearly in their favor and neither too strong nor too slack.|$|E
60|$|It is bold {{water at}} the mouth of the bay; you can steer a ship about either sentinel, close enough to toss a biscuit on the rocks. Thus it chanced that, as the tattooed man sat dozing and dreaming, he was startled into {{wakefulness}} and animation by the appearance of a <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> beyond the western islet. Two more headsails followed; and before the tattooed man had scrambled to his feet, a topsail schooner of some hundred tons had luffed about the sentinel, and was standing up the bay, close-hauled.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly the Spanish officer, {{when their}} prow was {{not more than}} twenty paces from him, ceased to shout, and lifting his piece fired. Martin, looking upwards with his left eye, thought that he saw Hans flinch, but the pilot made no sound. Only he did {{something}} to the tiller, putting all his strength on to it, {{and it seemed to}} the pair of them as though the Swallow was for an instant checked in her flight--certainly her prow appeared to lift itself from the water. Suddenly there was a sound of something snapping--a sound that could be heard even through the yell of terror from the soldiers in the boat. It was the bowsprit which had gone, leaving the <b>jib</b> <b>flying</b> loose like a great pennon.|$|R
6000|$|I ran {{forward and}} had the {{downhaul}} of the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> all in and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward. The three men in it gazed at us suspiciously. They had been hogging the sea, and they knew Wolf Larsen, by reputation at any rate. I noted that the hunter, a huge Scandinavian sitting in the bow, held his rifle, ready to hand, across his knees. It {{should have been in}} its proper place in the rack. When they came opposite our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand, and cried: ...|$|E
60|$|We {{ran down}} the <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> hauled the jib-sheets to wind-ward and the main-sheet flat, and came up into the wind. The oars struck the water, and with a few strokes the boat was alongside. I now caught my first fair glimpse of the woman. She was wrapped in a long ulster, for the morning was raw; and I could see nothing but her face and a mass of light brown hair {{escaping}} from under the seaman’s cap on her head. The eyes were large and brown and lustrous, the mouth sweet and sensitive, and the face itself a delicate oval, though sun and exposure to briny wind had burnt the face scarlet.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was little}} {{ceremony}} about the matter. The priests went {{aside for a}} moment, laid their shaven old crowns together, and went over a little mummery. Whereupon, their leader tore a long strip from his girdle of white tappa, {{and handed it to}} one of the French officers, who, after explaining what was to be done, gave it to Jermin. The mate at once went out {{to the end of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> boom, and fastened there the mystic symbol of the ban. This put to flight a party of girls who had been observed swimming toward us. Tossing their arms about, and splashing the water like porpoises, with loud cries of [...] "taboo! taboo!" [...] they turned about and made for the shore.|$|E
60|$|Off {{the coast}} of Portugal we meet with many {{different}} kinds of craft, of which the trading schooners differ from almost any other kind of vessel. Broad in the beam, and short in the counter, some are rounded at the stem, some nearly square. They are decked, and are from forty to one hundred tons burden. They are peculiarly rigged, having only lower masts stepped at different angles. The gaffs of the fore-sail, as well as the main-sail, can be raised to different heights. They have fore stay-sail, jib and <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> gaff top-sails, and a large square sail and square top-sails. On the whole, they are ungainly-looking craft in the extreme; but they are very capable sea-boats, and make voyages as far as South America.|$|E
60|$|Back we held, {{two miles}} {{and more to}} {{windward}} of the struggling cockle-shell, when the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> was run down and the schooner hove to. The sealing boats are not made for windward work. Their hope lies in keeping a weather position {{so that they may}} run before the wind for the schooner when it breezes up. But in all that wild waste there was no refuge for Leach and Johnson save on the Ghost, and they resolutely began the windward beat. It was slow work in the heavy sea that was running. At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing combers. Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff into the big whitecaps, lose headway, and be flung back like a cork.|$|E
60|$|Once out of {{the river}} he came on deck again, and, {{ignoring}} by a great effort the smiles of the crew and the jibes of the mate, took command. The only alteration he made in his dress was to substitute his sou’-wester for the bonnet, and in this guise he did his work, while the aggrieved Tommy hopped it in blankets. The three days at sea passed like a horrid dream. So covetous was his gaze, that the crew instinctively clutched their nether garments and looked to the buttoning of their coats as they passed him. He saw coats in the mainsail, and fashioned phantom trousers {{out of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>jib,</b> and towards the end began to babble of blue serges and mixed tweeds. Oblivious of fame, he had resolved to enter the harbour of Battlesea by night; but it was not to be. Near home the wind dropped, and the sun was well up before Battlesea came into view, a grey bank on the starboard bow.|$|E
60|$|I {{came back}} and went on with my work; and here the episode ended for the time, though further {{developments}} were yet to take place. I set the breakfast-table in the cabin, and at seven o’clock waited on the hunters and officers. The storm had evidently broken during the night, though a huge sea was still running and a stiff wind blowing. Sail {{had been made in}} the early watches, so that the Ghost was racing along under everything except the two topsails and the <b>flying</b> <b>jib.</b> These three sails, I gathered from the conversation, were to be set immediately after breakfast. I learned, also, that Wolf Larsen was anxious {{to make the most of}} the storm, which was driving him to the south-west into that portion of the sea where he expected to pick up with the north-east trades. It was before this steady wind that he hoped to make the major portion of the run to Japan, curving south into the tropics and north again as he approached the coast of Asia.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{the first}} watch from eight to midnight. The wind was soon blowing half a gale, and our sailing-master {{expected}} little sleep that night as he paced {{up and down the}} poop. The topsails were soon clewed up and made fast, then the <b>flying</b> <b>jib</b> run down and furled. Quite a sea was rolling by this time, occasionally breaking over the decks, flooding them and threatening to smash the boats. At six bells we were ordered to turn them over and put on storm lashings. This occupied us till eight bells, when we were relieved by the mid-watch. I was the last to go below, doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker. Below all were asleep except our green hand, the [...] "bricklayer," [...] who was dying of consumption. The wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale, flickering light through the fo'castle and turned to golden honey the drops of water on the yellow oilskins. In all the corners dark shadows seemed to come and go, while up in the eyes of her, beyond the pall bits, descending from deck to deck, where they seemed to lurk like some dragon at the cavern's mouth, it was dark as Erebus. Now and again, the light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier than usual, only to recede, leaving it darker and blacker than before. The roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the beach, while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the fo'castle. The creaking and groaning of the timbers, stanchions, and bulkheads, as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt, served to drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk. The working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of flaky powder to fall, and sent another sound mingling with the tumultous storm. Small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the fo'castle head above, and, joining issue with the streams from the wet oilskins, ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold.|$|E
