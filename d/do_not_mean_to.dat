5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Scott's {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} his anonymity, almost every reviewer guessed that Waverley was his work. Many readers too recognized his hand. One, Jane Austen, wrote: [...] "Walter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. – It is not fair. He has Fame and Profit enough as a Poet, {{and should not be}} taking the bread out of other people's mouths.– I do not like him, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> like Waverley if I can help it – but fear I must".|$|E

"From {{the point}} of view of both {{language}} and contents, I conclude that the Pali inscriptions of Burma and Siam give firm evidence for a Theravadin presence in the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya basins, from about the 5th century CE onwards. From the extent and richness of the evidence it seems that the Theravada was the predominant school, and that it enjoyed the patronage of ruling and economic elites. But I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> suggest that religious society was monolithic: other schools may well have been present, or have come and gone, and there is ample evidence ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a decade}} most {{scientists}} had started espousing evolution, {{but from the}} outset some expressed opposition {{to the concept of}} natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 Richard Owen attacked Darwin's Origin of Species in an anonymous review while praising [...] "Professor Owen" [...] for [...] "the establishment of the axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things". Sir John Herschel apparently dismissed Darwin's book as [...] "the law of higgledy-pigglety", and in 1861 he wrote of evolution that [...] "An intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change–to regulate their amount–to limit their divergence–and to continue them in a definite course". He added [...] "On the other hand, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)". Christian scientist Sir David Brewster wrote an article called [...] "" [...] in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God's perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin's book contained both [...] "much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation", although accepting that [...] "every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men".|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Harris Sagaser sets Sonnet 29 {{apart from}} other Elizabethan sonnets in that the speaker is the main focus, as opposed to many love sonnets of the time focused entirely on {{the object of the}} speaker's affection, or so of the poet's desire; this would seem that the poem is about the woman, not the speaker. However, Sasager says, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply that... (these poems) are {{themselves}} 'about' particular beloveds. But they do pretend to be, and therein is the difference. She goes on to clarify this difference, or what sets sonnet 29 apart from most love object-centered sonnets of the time. [...] "The poet-lover in sonnet 29 admits up front that the fruits of his inward experience are primarily his own, though not his own in terms of everafter fame... Instead, the speaker of 29 is concerned first to wonder" [...] This is to say that though most poetry of the time was at least disguised to be about the object of the speaker's affection, this sonnet does not even attempt to do so. According to Sasager, it is clear that this poem is speaker-focused and about the emotions and experiences of the speaker, not that of the beloved. As discussed by other critics, Sasager addresses the lack of [...] "when... then" [...] structure saying [...] "the poem shifts to representing a particular moment: not a past moment, but now." [...] She makes a point to say this differs notably from other poems of the time.|$|E
