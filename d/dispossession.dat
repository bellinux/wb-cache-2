5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total <b>dispossession</b> of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful <b>dispossession</b> of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{why and how}} wasteland development narratives persist {{through an}} evaluation of wasteland development policies in India from 1970 -present. Integrating critical scholarship on environmental narratives and enclosures, I find that narratives of wastelands as “empty” spaces available for “improvement” continue because they are metaphors for entrenched struggles between the government’s shifting visions of “improvement” and communities whose land use practices contradict these logics. Since the 1970 s, “improvement” has meant establishing different types of tree plantations on wastelands to ostensibly provide energy security. These projects have dispossessed land users by enclosing common property lands and providing forms of energy incommensurate with local needs, a trend I term “energy <b>dispossessions.</b> ” Factors enabling energy <b>dispossessions</b> include the government’s increased attempts to establish public-private partnerships to carry out “improvement” and a “field of observation” constructed to obscure local livelihoods. Unveiling these logics will help to problematize and contest future iterations of wasteland development...|$|R
50|$|LatCRTs {{main focus}} is to {{advocate}} for social justice for {{people who live in}} marginalized communities, specifically Chicana/Chicano individuals. These marginalized communities are guided by structural arrangements that disadvantage people of color.

In order to give voice to those that are disenfranchised, LatCRT has created two common themes.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of community-based management (CBM), as a participatory governance system, for securing the access to fishery resources and coastal land of small-scale indigenous communities, whose livelihoods have been previously threatened by market-led and government-supported <b>dispossessions,</b> known as ocean grabbing. From CBM experiences in Coron Island in the Philippines, Gili Indah in Indonesia and Patos Lagoon in Brazil, I found that CBM is a powerful tool to put forward legislative pressure for placing pro-community norms and institutions and, to create public awareness on environmental degradation and fishermen marginalization. However, without the support from government authorities or NGOs, the lack of education and competition for resources among fishermen prevent {{the creation of a}} comprehensive system for conflict resolution and community administration over resources...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the special}} {{relationship}} with land that characterises indigenous groups, rights over land and natural resources {{are at the heart}} of indigenous claims under international law. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court have developed a copious jurisprudence on the subject matter and contributed to the establishment of certain minimum indigenous peoples’ land rights under customary international law. This article analyses the Inter-American judicial discourse on land issues in the light of the current status of relevant international law and reﬂects upon the potential contribution of the former to the further development of the latter. It focuses on the relationship between historical <b>dispossessions</b> and indigenous contemporary land claims, on the state duty to land delimitation, demarcation and titling, and on indigenous peoples’ ownership over natural resources located within their traditional lands and their participatory rights in relation to resource exploitation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the politicized struggles for land in South Africa’s Limpopo Province. With land having been an {{essential}} part of colonial and apartheid segregation policies and practice – with 87 % of land appropriated by whites –, a land reform programme was imperative after the African National Congress came to power in 1994. One of the three branches of the land reform programme, land restitution, is a key focus of this thesis. It is particular in its goal to do justice to victims of past land <b>dispossessions</b> who lost land rights as result of racially-discriminatory laws by compensating them for this past loss of land and livelihoods. Where compensation for lost rights involves the government buying and redistributing land to groups with historical rights to land, such land deals present particular challenges around the ideal of restorative justice and what is means to ‘bring the past into the present’...|$|R
40|$|The recent digging of a {{new channel}} for water {{delivery}} to expand irrigation in the Ord provides a good opportunity for unearthing the native title agreement that allows for intensification of agriculture there. Initial irrigation development in this north-eastern Australian catchment did not include recognition of, consultation with, or distribution of benefits to Indigenous people impacted by dam creation and land flooding. Forming agreement between those affected by previous <b>dispossessions,</b> and associated accumulation of wealth via mining and irrigation, with those initiating such activities was an important and challenging process. The Ord Final Agreement (OFA), formalised in 2006, came from negotiations between Miriuwung and Gajerrong traditional owners and government and private interests. Through qualitative research, I dissect the context {{and content of the}} OFA to identify the strengths and weaknesses therein.

40|$|With our paper, {{we put the}} {{discussion}} into a context of repression. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, citizens are not always able to express their discontent openly, and such a coercive context incites them to look for other, more low-profile but equally effective ways of contestation. As we will show through a case-study of a large, state-owned hospital and in Kinshasa, what we frame as “individual teamwork” is an alternative and often-used way to protest and survive. The hospital was built in 1923, when the DRC was a Belgian colony, and has known numerous expansions since its founding, which have not only led to <b>dispossessions</b> and displacements, but also to a complete obstruction of the circulation of vehicles and pedestrians. As such, the expansions expropriated the citizens not only from their private homes, but also from public thoroughfares. In this paper, we explore how Kinshasa’s inhabitants react to these acts of urban displacement that hinder their daily experiences. What are their options to overcome this ill-advised intervention in the urban tissue...|$|R
