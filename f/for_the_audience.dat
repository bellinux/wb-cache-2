5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and filters a set of responses <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|According to Lyne's audio commentary, test {{screenings}} {{indicated that}} the initial version of the film was overwhelming <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> In response, about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from {{the last third of}} the film, were removed from the final cut.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone wall on the Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E
50|$|This {{series was}} narrated by Michael Angelis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.K. <b>audiences,</b> who also re-dubbed only two episodes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>audiences,</b> while Alec Baldwin narrated <b>the</b> episodes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>audiences,</b> {{which was also}} his last series. Six were re-dubbed by Michael Brandon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>audiences.</b>|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the event}} {{broadcasting}} live, TNA held an untelevised match <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> in attendance. It was an Intergender Tag Team match pitting the team of Eric Young and Sojournor Bolt against Lance Rock and Christy Hemme. The team of Young and Bolt won the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as Citizen Kane. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
50|$|The mix {{of foreign}} accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean <b>for</b> example in <b>the</b> Spanish case) was odd <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1997 {{the myth}} of Myrrha and Cinyras was one of 24 tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses that were retold by English poet Ted Hughes in his poetical work Tales from Ovid. The work was praised for not {{directly}} translating, but instead retelling the story in a language which was as fresh and new <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> today as Ovid's texts were to his contemporary audience. Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
50|$|This article {{lists and}} details episodes from the 2nd {{series of the}} show, which was first {{broadcast}} in 1986. This series was initially narrated by Ringo Starr <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.K. <b>audiences,</b> who re-dubbed 16 episodes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>audiences</b> on Shining Time Station. The entire series was later re-dubbed by George Carlin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>audiences.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{show will}} consist of many popular Indian and Pakistani comedians who will perform a standup comedy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b> <b>The</b> show has a new look and feel with fresh set of jokes {{that have never been}} showcased before. Not just that, there are renowned comedians from Pakistan along with Indian artists adding a new flavour to the show.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{audience}}.</b> To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> by the final reel.|$|E

50|$|It {{deserves to}} be {{mentioned}} that in 1992, the singer Rositsa Ovcharova won first place and <b>the</b> award <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> favourite act at the “Discovery - 92” contest {{in the city of}} Varna by singing Boris’ song “Message”.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to debate {{whether or not she}} survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage and}} the spaces set {{out in front of}} it for an {{audience}} create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> including the impromptu or improvised (2, 3, 6); the temporary (2); the elaborate (9); or the traditional and permanent (5, 7). They are erected indoors (3, 5, 9) or outdoors (2, 4, 6). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft (10). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.|$|E
5|$|Working for Clair Brothers, Jackson toured with Elvis Presley, mixing {{monitors}} while independent engineer Bill Porter mixed {{front of}} house (FOH) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Clair Brothers supplied all the audio gear; Jackson designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. To make {{more room for}} audience seating, he also used a sound reinforcement system that was not mounted on scaffolding but hung with steel chain above the audience from overhead beams, using chain hoists rigged upside down to raise the loudspeakers from the floor—a now-common method used by licensed riggers. Jackson {{has said that he}} made a number of concert recordings during this period, all unreleased.|$|E
50|$|The show's first seasons {{featured}} a canned laugh track, but Bolaños made the then-controversial decision to drop it. Most presentations {{of the show}} include the announcer's warning that, out of respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> intelligence, there was no laugh track.|$|R
40|$|This chapter shows that, {{although}} the geographical roots of Christian metal (CM) bands do play a role, not least <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences,</b> <b>the</b> crossing of national borders in online settings {{is equally important}} both to <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and to <b>the</b> bands themselves. A detailed look into the discourse and interaction around Finnish CM music on YouTube. com is <b>the</b> basis <b>for</b> considering social media sites, such as YouTube, as providing a space for translocal negotiation of and identification {{on the basis of}} religiosity, music, language and place...|$|R
2500|$|Cleveland native Arsenio Hall's {{television}} program, The Arsenio Hall Show, {{is known}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> shouting [...] "Woof, woof, woof!"

He would refer to a section of <b>the</b> live <b>audience</b> as his [...] "Dawg Pound." ...|$|R
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a live band and constant touring would break the band out of its Orange County home turf. Numerous compilations and college radio air play helped the band build a devoted following across the USA and overseas. Local live shows featured casino nights with play money, food and prizes, raffle giveaways and swag bags <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b> <b>The</b> band licensed merchandise for everything from T-shirts to candy bars.|$|R
