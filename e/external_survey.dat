50|$|HEDIS {{data are}} {{collected}} through surveys, medical charts and insurance claims for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. Survey measures must {{be conducted by}} an NCQA-approved <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> organization. Clinical measures use the administrative or hybrid data collection methodology, as specified by NCQA. Administrative data are electronic records of services, including insurance claims and registration systems from hospitals, clinics, medical offices, pharmacies and labs. For example, a measure titled Childhood Immunization Status requires health plans to identify 2 year old {{children who have been}} enrolled for at least a year. The plans report the percentage of children who received specified immunizations. Plans may collect data for this measure by reviewing insurance claims or automated immunization records, but this method will not include immunizations received at community clinics that do not submit insurance claims. For this measure, plans are allowed to select a random sample of the population and supplement claims data with data from medical records. By doing so, plans may identify additional immunizations and report more favorable and accurate rates. However, the hybrid method is more costly, time-consuming and requires nurses or medical record reviewers who are authorized to review confidential medical records.|$|E

40|$|Since through trips {{can be a}} {{significant}} portion of travel in a study area, estimating them {{is an important part of}} travel demand modeling. In the past, through trips have been estimated using <b>external</b> <b>surveys.</b> Recently, <b>external</b> <b>surveys</b> were suspended in Texas, so Texas transportation planners need a way to estimate through trips without using <b>external</b> <b>surveys.</b> Other research in the area has focused on study areas with a population of less than 200, 000, but many Texas study areas have a population of more than 200, 000. This research developed a set of two logit models to estimate through trips for a wide range of study area sizes, including larger study areas. The first model estimates the portion of all trips at an external station that are through trips. The second model distributes those through trips at one external station to the other external stations. The models produce separate results for commercial and noncommercial vehicles, and these results can be used to develop through trip tables. For predictor variables, the models use results from a very simple gravity model; the average daily traffic (ADT) at each external station as a proportion of the total ADT at all available external stations; the number of turns on the routes between external station pairs; and whether the route is valid, where a valid route is one that passes through the study area and does not pass through any other external stations. Evaluations of the performance of the models showed that the predictions fit the observations reasonably well; at least 68 percent of the absolute prediction errors for each model and for the models combined were less than 10 percent. These results indicate that the models can be useful for practical applications...|$|R

We inves-tigated the current status of ABO Ab titer measurements at various laboratories in Korea and the impact of the protocol provided to reduce interlaboratory variations in the meth-ods and results of ABO Ab titers. Methods: The Korean external quality assessment of blood bank laboratories sent <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> samples with a questionnaire to 68 laboratories across Korea for the measurement of ABO Ab titers in May 2012. After 6 months, a second set of survey samples were sent with a standard protocol to 53 of the previously surveyed laboratories.

Results: Several interlaboratory variations were observed in the results, technical proce-dures, and methods selected for measurement. We found that 80. 4 % laboratories hoped to change their protocol to the provisional one. Additionally, CAT showed significantly lower variation among laboratories (P = 0. 006) than the tube test. Conclusions: Our study provides baseline data regarding the current status of ABO Ab ti-ter measurement in Korea.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{commentators}} {{argue that}} fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy uncertainty slowed the {{recovery from the}} 2007 - 2009 recession. To assess this view we develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) that draws on the frequency of newspaper references to economic policy uncertainty and other indicators. Our index spikes near tight presidential elections and after the Gulf wars, the 9 / 11 attack, and other major events. It also rises steeply from 2008 onward. Based on a human audit of 5, 000 news articles and <b>external</b> <b>surveys,</b> our EPU index appears to offer a good proxy for policy-related economic uncertainty. Simple VAR models indicate the increases in policy uncertainty foreshadow weaker aggregate economic performance. Using micro-data, we investigate the impact of EPU on investment and hiring, finding large negative effects for firms heavily exposed to government spending. Extending our measurement efforts back to 1900, we find that EPU rose dramatically in the Great Recession, but only from 1932 onwards when Hoover and then Roosevelt initiated a period of intense policy activism. We also find a secular rise in policy uncertainty since the 1960 s, coincident with government fiscal and regulatory expansion...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the catastrophic hydrogeological events which {{occurred}} in May 1998 in Campania, in the south of Italy, the distinctive features of airborne laser scanning mounted on a helicopter were used to survey the landslides at Sarno and Quindici. In order to survey the entire zone of interest, approximately 21 km 2, it was necessary to scan 12 laser strips. Many problems arose during the survey: difficulties in receiving the GPS signal, complex terrain features and unfavorable atmospheric conditions. These problems were investigated and it emerged {{that one of the most}} influential factors is the quality of GPS signals. By analysing the original GPS data, the traces obtained by fixing phase ambiguity with an On The Fly (OTF) algorithm were isolated from those with smoothed differential GPS solution (DGPS). Processing and analysis of laser data showed that not all the overlapping laser strips were congruent with each other. Since an <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> to verify the laser data accuracy was necessary, it was decided to utilize the kinematic GPS technique. The laser strips were subsequently adjusted, using the kinematic GPS data as reference points.

40|$|A TQM based {{approach}} has been developed {{to improve the quality}} of products of MDF boards manufacturing industry. The methodology developed has been implemented in a selected local company and a considerable improvement in the quality of boards have been observed. As the MDF boards manufacturing process is almost the same everywhere, the methodology implemented for quality improvements can be used for the entire MDF industry. As an initial step, a customer survey was carried out on the external customers. This survey covered the customer perception about quality of purchased boards and the product variety needed by the customers. For this survey, it used five MDF board manufactures both locally and in abroad. A questioner survey method was used for this purpose. Outcomes of this are poor quality boards, poor response for the customer complains and unavailability of customer preferred boards. Depending on the <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> outcomes, another survey was carried out on internal customers to reveal the exact reasons for poor quality. Main outcomes of this are, poor quality control method implemented, poor customer orientation, inadequate quality parameters and lack of quality related parameters exist within the industry. As a solution for these problems, a new TQM based quality control methodology has been developed and implemented for the entire production process. Further a quality council system and work team involvement method has been introduced to address the issues from both internal and external customers. Then process improvement technique was implemented in order to further improve quality and minimize waste. Here the Kaizen theory has been used as the main tool for process improvement.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this body}} of {{research}} is to determine whether injuries in the home are more common in particular types of housing. Previous home injuries research has {{tended to focus on}} behaviours or the provision of safety equipment to families with young children. There has been little consideration of the physical environment. This study reports methodological developments in database linkage and analysis to improve researchers abilities to utilise large administrative and clinical databases to carry out health and health services research. Methods The study involved linking a database of home injuries obtained from an emergency department surveillance system with an <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> of all homes in an area and population denominators for home types derived from a health service administrative database. Analysis of injury incidence by housing type was adjusted for potential biases due to deprivation and distance to hospital. For non-injured individuals data confidentiality considerations required the deprivation and distance measures be imputed. The process of randomly imputing these variables and the testing of the validity of this approach is detailed. Results There were 14, 081 first injuries in 112, 248 residents living in 54, 081 homes over a two-year period. The imputation method worked well with imputed and observed measures in the injured group being very similar. Re-randomisation and a repeated analysis gave identical results to the first analysis. One particular housing type had a substantially elevated odds ratio for injury occurrence, OR = 2. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 87 to 2. 30).

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{identify}} temporal dynamics in fishing power, by deriving three different indices (IFP 1, IFP 2, IFP 3) based on three independent methods. IFP 1 is derived from the GLM analysis of the relationship between fishing mortality and fishing effort, assuming that total fishing mortality estimates from XSA (eXtended Survivors Analysis) are accurate. IFP 2 is derived from the GLM analysis of the difference between the Log-CPUE of a vessel and the average Log-CPUE of a set of reference vessels, which are chosen with regards to the stability of their Log-CPUE over time. IFP 3 is derived from the GLM analysis of the Log-CPUE of a vessel relative to some <b>external</b> <b>survey</b> abundance index. Particular attention is paid to the horsepower and year effects in IFP 1, IFP 2, and IFP 3. This methodology is applied to the Danish, Dutch, English and Norwegian demersal fisheries of the North Sea. The fishing power estimated by all indices increases with horsepower, particularly in relation to target species. Despite less consensus in the estimation of annual variations in fishing power, some important features are highlighted. First, there are cases where fishing power has consistently increased over the period of investigation, possibly through an overall increase in fishing efficiency. Second, there are examples where fishing power has increased relative to one species, and remained constant or even decreased in relation to another one. In the context of mixed-species fisheries, this feature might reveal a shift in fishing tactics. Copyright 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Despite several standardization workshops and the availability of a worldwide accepted calibrator material for aCL, a high variability in numerical assay results and in sample classification is still observed in comparative studies and <b>external</b> quality control <b>surveys.</b> For anti-beta 2 GPI assays, comparison of numerical values is impeded by the absence of a common calibrator material, and <b>external</b> quality <b>surveys</b> similarly show a large overlap in sample classification.
