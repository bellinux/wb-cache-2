Each troop also rehearsed its own part in the mission. Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued {{was a pair of}} trouser fly buttons that, when placed {{one on top of the}} other, became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|The feud between John Cena and Umaga {{continued}} on Raw the next night, where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later. Due to the Umaga assault, Cena injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real in their storyline. At Royal Rumble, a Last Man Standing match, a match {{where the only}} way to win is to beat up your opponent so much they can not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> feet before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga. Cena won the match and retained his title, ending their rivalry.|$|E

5|$|The main {{match on}} the Raw brand was a Fatal Four-Way {{match for the}} WWE Championship {{involving}} champion John Cena, Randy Orton, Edge, and Shawn Michaels. Cena won the match and retained the championship after pinning Orton. The primary match on the SmackDown! brand was a Last Man Standing match for the World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Batista, which ended in a no-contest after both men failed <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> feet before the referee counted to ten. The featured match on the ECW brand was Bobby Lashley versus Team McMahon (Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon) in a Handicap match for the ECW World Championship. Vince won the title and the match for his team after pinning Lashley.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} The Undertaker against Batista in a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. At one spot, Undertaker leg dropped Batista through an {{announce}} table. Towards the end, the two fought up the entrance ramp, where Batista speared to The Undertaker off the stage. Neither man could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> feet before the referee's count of ten; in result, the match {{ended in a}} draw. Due to WWE regulations, titles can't change hands in a Last Man Standing match by a draw, so The Undertaker remained champion.|$|E

25|$|By not {{affecting}} the existing rail {{service of the}} 177 trains per day using the corridor, a risk of loss of ridership was removed that could have occurred in relation to potential delays. Long and short distance travellers were continuously able to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> destinations as planned, which helped to avoid {{an increase in the}} use of personal vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters: such as {{emergency}} cold-weather shelters {{opened by}} churches or community agencies, which may consist of cots {{in a heated}} warehouse, or temporary Christmas Shelters. More elaborate homeless shelters such as Pinellas Hope in Florida provide their residents with a recreation tent, a dining tent, laundry facilities, outdoor tents, casitas, and shuttle services that help inhabitants <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> jobs every day.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for residents to access other remote areas by foot. Most locals can tell you how many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. Walking often is the only way for people to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E

25|$|On 31 October 2010, a {{bomb was}} found inside a Toyota Carina {{parked in the}} long-stay car park and Army bomb {{disposal}} experts dismantled it. It is believed that the car and bomb {{had been in the}} car park since 2009. It was only discovered when workers were getting ready to tow the vehicle out of the car park. Many passengers had {{to spend the night in}} hotels or arrange alternative transport as they were unable to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the wiring parties was {{to slow down the}} enemy’s attack, while {{speeding}} up their own. For this reason, workers attempted to make it impossible for the enemy to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> trench, while sabotaging the enemy’s wire for their own benefit. In addition, though the distance between trenches varied between 7 and 500 yards, workers tried to erect barbed wire defences as far away from their trench as possible, to prevent the enemy from getting too close to the trench, or possibly lobbing in grenades.|$|E

After lunch, classes resume at 1pm, {{and there is a}} break around afternoon teatime before another class period. The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours. Classes end around five o'clock. First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat their dinner in the Great Hall, after which they are expected to be in their common rooms. Astronomy classes take place late at night in the Astronomy Tower.|$|E
25|$|The Aladdin was {{scheduled}} to reopen on August 17, 2000, at 6:00p.m., with fireworks at 10:00p.m. The opening was delayed while the Clark County building inspector completed its fire safety testing. Another delay was caused by last-minute repairs to the casino surveillance system. This left thousands of Aladdin visitors leaving in disappointment, as well as opening night hotel guests wondering where they'd spend the night. Many high-rollers waited out on the sidewalks {{in front of the}} Aladdin for hours. Most were unable to even <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> luggage, since the hotel had been locked down for testing. Aladdin employees tried to arrange alternate accommodations for the guests with Paris and Bellagio.|$|E
25|$|These census numbers show a 363,000 {{population}} {{increase in the}} western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east {{to the west and}} new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new homes between 1860 and 1870.|$|E

25|$|All {{passengers}} {{traveling on}} international flight must {{pass through the}} duty-free shop in order to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> flight. There is a possibility for some passengers (for example, those allergic to perfume) to ask security to use a narrow corridor which bypasses the shop. Nonetheless, the layout has been criticized by teetotalist organizations. The airport's response is that the layout was needed due to the terminal's small size. The shop has also been criticized for informing passengers who purchase less than their permitted tax-free quota of alcohol that {{they are allowed to}} purchase more. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs indicated that this may violate the ban on alcohol advertising.|$|E
25|$|As {{the years}} passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used {{corridor}} from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots {{of the trail}} continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 {{the population in the}} states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new residences.|$|E
25|$|Tackling is {{the only}} way to stop a player from running and is a major part of any team's defence. A good tackle stops the player from moving forward and {{prevents}} them from passing the ball. It can also put an opponent under pressure and force the ball loose. There are five styles of tackles commonly used by players: the side, rear, passive front, active front and smother. The aim of the active front tackle is to drive the opponent backwards, while the smother tackle prevents the opposing player passing the ball. Once the player has been brought to ground, the tackler typically tries to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> feet quickly and compete for the ball. Other players arriving at the tackle will also compete for the ball.|$|E
