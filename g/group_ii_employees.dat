40|$|Aortic valve {{replacement}} (AVR) using allografts is an established method of treating aortic valve disease. It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR {{can be justified}} in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 2). One <b>group</b> I and 4 <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral {{valve replacement}} (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in <b>group</b> <b>II</b> were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 121 minutes) were similar. Operative deaths occurred in 4 of 8 group I and 1 of 7 <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patients. All surviving patients have been successfully followed (group I, 28 months; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 18 months). No group I patient has required reoperation. One <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patient required reoperation for recurrent infection affecting the allograft, and another <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patient died 10 months postoperatively from noncardiac causes. All other <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patients are alive and well with functioning allografts. AVR with allografts can be performed safely in this high-risk patient population...|$|R

40|$|Transmission of {{information}} from the terminals <b>group</b> <b>II</b> muscle afferents is subject to potent presynaptic modulation by both segmental <b>group</b> <b>II</b> and cutaneous afferents and by descending monoaminergic systems. Currently it is unknown whether descending corticospinal fibres affect this transmission. Here we have examined whether corticospinal tract activation modulates the size of monosynaptic focal synaptic potentials (FSPs) evoked by <b>group</b> <b>II</b> muscle afferents, and the excitability of intraspinal terminals of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> afferents, {{both of which are}} indices used to show presynaptic control. Conditioning stimulation of corticospinal pathways had no effects on the sizes of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> evoked FSPs in the midlumbar or sacral segments at either dorsal horn or intermediate zone locations. These stimuli also had no effect on the excitability of single <b>group</b> <b>II</b> afferent terminals in the dorsal horn of the midlumbar segments. As positive controls, we verified that the corticospinal conditioning stimuli used did effectively d epress FSPs evoked from cutaneous afferents recorded at the same spinal locations as the <b>group</b> <b>II</b> field potentials in all experiments. Corticospinal tract conditioning stimuli did not consistently enhance or reduce the depression of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> FSPs that was evoked by stimulation of ipsilateral segmental <b>group</b> <b>II</b> or cutaneous afferents; in the large majority of cases there was no effect. The results reveal that the control of transmission {{of information}} from <b>group</b> <b>II</b> afferents in these regions of the spinal cord is independent of direct corticospinal control...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} 1961 - 91 {{a total of}} 567, 635 strains of Staphylococcus aureus from hospitalized {{patients}} in Denmark have been characterized according to their antibiotic resistance, site of isolation and phage type. Strains of phage <b>group</b> <b>II</b> (typed by the phages 3 A, 3 C, 55 and 71) have been analysed further. The occurrence of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains was relatively constant (approximately 16 %) from 1961 until 1983. Since then the frequency of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains increased; in 1991 they accounted for 22. 7 % of all S. aureus strains isolated. Strains of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> can, {{on the basis of}} their phage types, be divided in four subgroups: 3 A, 71, 71 + and the 'rest of group II'. Furthermore, within these groups strains may differ from one another in respect to their sensitivity to phages. The increased isolation of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains during recent years was because of an increase in strains of subgroups 71 + and the 'rest of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains'. In 1991 these two subgroups accounted for 89. 7 % of all <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains. Furthermore, an increasing number of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains, 71. 4 % in 1991, was typable only at RTD x 100. The increase in the number of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains was even throughout Denmark. All four subgroups of <b>group</b> <b>II</b> have, during the observation period, become more frequently resistant to penicillin and/or tetracycline. Strains typed at 100 x RTD of subgroup 71 + and the 'rest of group II' are more frequently antibiotic resistant than the rest of the <b>group</b> <b>II</b> strains. Strains of the increasing subgroups occurred most often in abscesses...|$|R
