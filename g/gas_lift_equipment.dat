40|$|Main Body- The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} design of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> <b>equipment</b> have faced many challenges over the years. Designs of production wells for lifting oil using low casing pressure lead to cold flow of the extracted fluid. This is because the wells need lower rates of gas lift. It is recommended to use gas lifting pressure in the range of 1120 to 1200 Psi [1]. Producers, who produce lower volumes of oil, require small amounts of gas in order to lift the fluid. They fit gas chokes for controlling the volume of gas lift in gas lift wells. Lower oil production gas volume is small and this leads to a falling in pressure which eventually lowers the temperature of the injected gas that flows down the casing. The reduction in temperature of the casing surfaces results in the cooling of the temperature of the gases in the casing lower than the deeper depths. The low gas temperatures on the surface casing also cool down the temperature of the lifted oil, sometimes to temperatures below the pour point temperature of the surface. This low temperature of the produced crude oil leads to the formation of wax in the production string. The condition is worse in the winter season when the country experiences extreme weather conditions. The condition may exceedingly limit the flow of oil or even plug the oil tubing entirely [2]. As a remedy to this problem, high pressure gas with the potential of raising the temperature in the well need to be introduced. This can be done through the design of wells whereby the oils are lifted at pressures higher than the pour point pressures to prevent wax formation. Chemical treatment may also be adopted. In the chemical treatment procedure, wax inhibitors are injected down the casing together with gas to keep the tubing clean. Another method that {{can be used as a}} remedy is the wire line tools. They are used t...|$|E

Optimal Containment Genetic Algorithm (OMSGA) is applied in this method to optimize the parameters such as mass flow rate(Q), volume of gas injection(Qin), injection pressure(Pin), tubing header pressure(Pt), tubing inside diameter(Dt). According to practical situation of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> production, the <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> efficiency (η) is selected as the objective function, the suitable fitness function and value of operators of OMSGA are given, and reasonable convergence delay-independent conditions is set. Based on the intelligence and global quick search of GA and the convergence of OMSGA, the design parameters of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> can be globally optimized quickly and accurately.

30|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} was presented regarding {{the effect of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> initiation time on the optimization process. A procedure was developed to select the best initiation time for the <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> to reach to the highest profit for a reservoir which was producing naturally and was under depletion. The proposed optimizer algorithm was compared with previous models and its accuracy has been confirmed. By integrating the proposed algorithm with the economic model and calculating the related NPV of different initiation times, the optimum time for starting the <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> operation was found.

40|$|Gas lift {{optimization}} {{is becoming}} more important now a day in petroleum industry. A proper lift optimization can reduce the operating cost, increase the net present value (NPV) and maximize the recovery from the asset. A widely accepted definition of <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> optimization is to obtain the maximum output under specified operating conditions. In addition, <b>gas</b> <b>lift,</b> a costly and indispensable means to recover oil from high depth reservoir entails solving the <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> optimization problems. Gas lift optimization is a continuous process; there are two levels of production optimization. The total field optimization involves optimizing the surface facilities and the injection rate {{that can be achieved}} by standard tools softwares. Well level optimization can be achieved by optimizing the well parameters such as point of injection, injection rate, and injection pressure. All these aspects have been investigated and presented in this study by using experimental data and PROSPER simulation program. The results show that the well head pressure has a large influence on the <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> performance and also proved that smart <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> valve can be used to improve <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> performance by controlling gas injection from down hole. Obtaining the optimum gas injection rate is important because excessive gas injection reduces production rate and consequently increases the operation cost.
