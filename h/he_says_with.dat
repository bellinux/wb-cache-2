25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E
25|$|They go on {{to discuss}} what {{is good or bad}} in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, {{critically}} commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.|$|E
500|$|The non-destruction of one's coat, he says, is not fated simply, but co-fated {{with its}} {{being taken care}} of, and someone's being saved from his enemies is co-fated with his fleeing those enemies; and having {{children}} is co-fated with being willing to lie with a woman. ... For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he says, it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ... But {{it will be in}} our power, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> what is in our power being included in fate.|$|E

500|$|Morrell also records how {{a hunting}} trip ashore in California {{led to a}} {{skirmish}} with the locals which turned into a full-scale battle ending, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> seventeen natives dead and seven of Tartars men wounded. Morrell claims that {{he was among the}} casualties, with an arrow in his thigh. Of a visit to San Francisco Morrell writes: [...] "The inhabitants are principally Mexicans and Spaniards who are very indolent and consequently very filthy." [...] After revisiting the Galapagos Islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin, Tartar began a slow journey home on October 13, 1825. As they left the Pacific Morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along the American Pacific coast. Tartar finally reached New York Harbour on May 8, 1826 with a main cargo of 6,000 fur seals. This haul did not please Morrell's employers, who had evidently expected rather more. [...] "The reception I met from my owners was cold and repulsive", he wrote. [...] "The Tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold, and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing".|$|E
