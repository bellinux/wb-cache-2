40|$|A Fuel {{gasoline}} engine {{can also use}} gas fuel beside gasoline. Nevertheless. if this {{gasoline engine}} uses gas fuel, {{the performance of the}} engine will decrease, because the engine is designed for gasoline as its fuel. This performance reduction is caused by the-different characteristics of the tow fuels. One way to Â·improve the perfomunce of gasoline engine that used gas fuel by controlling then <b>firring</b> time with eletronic controller to make the <b>firring</b> lime more accurate.

40|$|Otto {{cycle power}} {{will depend on}} spark plug <b>firring</b> efectivity where pruduct {{electrical}} inductive secondary voltage, while secondary voltage depend on space distance breaking electric current (Rhumkorf phenomena). The problem is how mm space distance and how breaking velocity will be producting maximum secondary voltage ? In this research used 6 independent variables distance space (0. 1 - 0. 6 mm wth 0. 1 mm interval) and 6 breaking velocity variables (1000 to 6000 rpm with 1000 interval). Secondary voltage datas will be curved to get maximum voltage with distance space and breaking velocity variables. For the datas will get the maaximum voltage on minimum distance space and breaking velocity. ...|$|E
