25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{to figure out what the}} hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E
2500|$|Time {{reviewer}} Josh Tyrangiel praised guitarist Buck's [...] "resurgence" [...] and [...] "propulsive riffs," [...] {{but also}} wrote, [...] "R.E.M.'s 14th album never quite generates the moody atmospherics {{of their first}} 10; it's {{a little hard to}} lose yourself in something that doesn't pause long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to get lost." [...] Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer John Mulvey stated, [...] "Accelerate is a simple, pragmatic record built on an uncomfortable truth: sometimes, even the best bands have to retrace their steps, if only to remind themselves what they're really good at." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} {{survived the}} hazards of the Soviet winter offensive, being moved around the 6th Army in January as the Wehrmacht prepared to continue their assault on the Soviet Union, helping to re-take Kharkov in May. The division's commander, Lieutenant General Max Pfeffer, anticipating a long upcoming struggle, joked to a Captain under his command over the latter's reluctance to accept a transfer offer to France, saying [...] "just be happy that you're getting a break. The war will last long enough and be terrible <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{to get a good}} taste of it." [...] On June 10, the division began crossing the Seversky Donets River by assault boat, constructing a bridge for other units, including the 14th Panzer Division. The division continued to make inroads around the black sea to take down the industrial city of Stalingrad, serving in IV corps under General of the Engineers Erwin Jaenecke.|$|E
2500|$|On {{two other}} {{occasions}} around this time, Van Gogh {{used the word}} [...] "arrangement" [...] to refer to color, {{similar to the way}} James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, [...] "As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better." [...] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: [...] "But this is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected." ...|$|E

2500|$|Welk had {{a number}} of {{instrumental}} hits, including a cover of the song [...] "Yellow Bird." [...] His highest charting record was [...] "Calcutta", written by Heino Gaze, which achieved hit status in 1961. Welk himself was indifferent to the tune, but his musical director, George Cates, said that if Welk did not wish to record the song, he (Cates) would. Welk replied, [...] "Well, if it's good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> George, I guess it's good enough for me." [...] Although the rock-and-roll explosion in the mid-1950s had driven most older artists off the charts, [...] "Calcutta" [...] reached number 1 on the U.S. pop charts between 13 and 26 February 1961; it was recorded in only one take. The tune knocked the Shirelles' [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" [...] out of the number 1 position, and it kept the Miracles' [...] "Shop Around" [...] from becoming the group's first number-1 hit, holding their recording at number 2. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.|$|E
2500|$|During a February 28, 2008 {{speech in}} Beaumont, Texas, Obama said, [...] "It's not good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{to say to}} your child, 'Do good in school,' and then when that child comes home, you got the TV set on, you got the radio on, you don't check their homework, {{there is not a}} book in the house, you've got the video game playing... So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help. If you don't know how to do it, call the teacher. Make them go to bed at a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that. Children have to have proper nutrition. That affects also how they study, how they learn in school." ...|$|E
2500|$|As part of this, Sting and Luger {{went up to}} rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson {{some time}} after Bash at the Beach {{and asked them to}} team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their {{differences}} for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the Nitro prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of Nitro and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, [...] "Is that good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> right there? Is that proof enough?" [...] Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture {{and walked out of the}} match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on Nitro, Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: ...|$|E
