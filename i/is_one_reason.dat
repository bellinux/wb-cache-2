5|$|Cobalt-60 has a {{radioactive}} half-life of 5.27years. The loss of potency requires periodic {{replacement of the}} source in radiotherapy and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear accelerators in modern radiation therapy.|$|E
5|$|The pine bunting and {{yellowhammer}} are {{so closely}} related that each {{responds to the}} other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E

25|$|UVB {{radiation}} {{can cause}} direct DNA damage. This cancer connection <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{adhesion}} formation <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why vaginal {{delivery is}} usually considered safer than elective caesarean section {{where there is}} no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.|$|E
50|$|The {{expansion}} of Carlingwood, which itself had {{many of the}} same types of retail stores as Fairlawn Plaza, may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the mall's dwindling customer base.|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{background}} of the main author of its constitution <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why the Weimar Republic {{was referred to as}} Judenrepublik ("Jews' Republic") by its detractors on the right.|$|R
50|$|The {{too high}} price of the vehicle <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why the serial {{production}} was not started. It cost 85% of the Masi and 50% {{of the price of}} Pasi.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt's {{leadership}} in the March of Dimes <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> he is commemorated on the American dime. Roosevelt was honored by the United States Postal Service with a Prominent Americans series 6¢ postage stamp, issue of 1966. He also appears on several other U.S. Postage stamps.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists prize local {{knowledge}} and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Community archaeology projects {{are starting to}} become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by {{the public in the}} locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.|$|E
25|$|Similarly with {{developmental}} dyslexia, {{there has been}} considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect {{can be hard to}} unravel. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why experts such as Moore have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.|$|E

50|$|Soon, Radio Yemen (an Egyptian-controlled organ) {{called for}} the {{assassination}} of the Al Saud including the Free Princes. That <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that the Free Princes became increasingly embittered with Nasser.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, then!" [...] I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't {{anything}} {{in it that}} it was sacrilege to let another person see. That <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why I had been crying.|$|R
25|$|The {{accelerated}} {{growth in}} different body parts happens at different times, {{but for all}} adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders. This non-uniform growth <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.|$|E
25|$|BST {{is used on}} {{hundreds}} of miles of the Alaska Highway and other similar roadways in Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and northern British Columbia. The ease of application of BST <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for its popularity, but another is its flexibility, which is important when roadways are laid down over unstable terrain that thaws and softens in the spring.|$|E
25|$|The Kelvin problem: What is {{the most}} {{efficient}} foam in 3 dimensions? This was conjectured to be solved by the Kelvin structure, and this was widely believed for over 100 years, until disproved by {{the discovery of the}} Weaire–Phelan structure. The surprising discovery of the Weaire–Phelan structure and disproof of the Kelvin conjecture <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the caution in accepting Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, Frøland married Jorunn Ragnhild Bye, {{and they}} {{divorced}} in 1984. Frøland had one son, Ebbe, {{who died on}} 1 January 2002. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why he retired from public life.|$|R

25|$|The {{dielectric}} {{thickness of}} electrolytic capacitors is very slight, {{in the range}} of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficient high dielectric strength the electrolytic capacitors can already achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.|$|E
25|$|If {{building}} a bigger network <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> to subsidize adoption, then stimulating value adding innovations is the other. Consider, for example, {{the value of}} an operating system with no applications. While Apple initially tried to charge both sides of the market, like Adobe did in figure 2, Microsoft uncovered a second pricing rule: subsidize those who add platform value. In this context, consumers, not developers are the money side.|$|E
25|$|A {{firewall}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} outgoing connections made by connect-back shellcode as well as incoming connections made by bindshells. They can therefore offer some protection against an attacker, even if the system is vulnerable, by preventing the attacker from connecting to the shell created by the shellcode. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why socket re-using shellcode is sometimes used: it does not create new connections and therefore is harder to detect and block.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not mention}} it," [...] exclaimed Dickory, with a shudder; [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that I ran away; I {{preferred}} any danger from man or beast to {{that he was}} taking me to." ...|$|R
5000|$|Salisbury {{opposed the}} use of Linnaeus's systema sexuale for {{classifying}} plants, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why others ignored his work. Another was the belief that Salisbury had behaved unethically. The censure was later reported as: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for my {{fixing the}} meeting early, when we often get it fine," [...] Osborn replied naïvely. [...] "The expense is a drawback, but the {{committee}} {{would not let}} me drop out." ...|$|R
25|$|Europeans are {{concerned}} about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of antisemitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why First Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said {{that the issue of}} European antisemitism was more important than many economic, financial, and market issues facing Europe.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{organizations}} and institutions, most Mexican artisans are impoverished with little access to quality materials or designs, {{because of lack}} of cultural knowledge. Artisans also must compete with goods manufactured in large factories and copies of Mexican artesania imported from places like China. This keeps prices down, and {{the time it takes to}} make authentic artesanía puts the Mexican craftsmen at an economic disadvantage. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why younger generations have less interest in the craft tradition.|$|E
25|$|Stronger {{magnetic}} {{effects are}} typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly {{the latter are}} usually strongly localized. Moreover, {{the size of the}} magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of gadolinium(III) (hence its use in MRI). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why superstrong magnets are typically based on elements like neodymium or samarium.|$|E
50|$|The pinafore was {{a type of}} apron {{that was}} pinned over the dress and easily removed for washing. Buttons were {{frequently}} damaged by lye cleaning products, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why dresses <b>were</b> not laundered very often.|$|R

30|$|I {{decreased}} steadily {{across time}} (Fig.  5 d), {{and there was}} a corresponding decrease in the amylopectin synthesis rate (Fig.  2 f). This may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the decline in the amylopectin/amylose ratio across time (Fig.  3).|$|R
