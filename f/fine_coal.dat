This fines stream was cyclone overflow, which contained 15–50% ash and was previously discarded. The particle size of this stream was less than 25µm.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fines</b> {{are small}} <b>coal</b> {{particles}} produced during coal seam gas (CSG) production and may plug fluid flow paths, resulting in {{significant reduction in}} CSG productivity. This study aims to employ laboratory experiments to examine coal permeability variation induced by <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation and migration during the dewatering stage. One coal sample from Bowen Basin, Australia, was tested under different pressure differences. The evolution of coal permeability {{and the amount of}} produced <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> were monitored during the experiments. The pressure difference was increased from the initial 0. 8 MPa to 1. 5 MPa through 7 steps to investigate its impact on the characteristics of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> and the corresponding permeability change, and to obtain the critical velocities for a range of particle sizes. Every 5 mL effluent was collected and analysed in terms of particle size distribution and volume. The results revealed that for this sample, the sizes of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> ranged from 1 μm to 14 μm. Initially the coal permeability dropped dramatically due to excessive <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation, with 74. 1 % reduction for the case of 0. 8 MPa pressure difference, followed by gradual decline with fluctuations. It was observed that the production of large <b>coal</b> <b>fine</b> particles was accompanied by significant permeability fluctuations. This was attributed to the counteraction between formation damage (cleats plugging and <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> settlement) and <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> removal from the samples (widened cleats). Although no clear correlation between particle size and pressure difference was observed, the critical particle size was positively related to the flow velocity. The velocity followed parabolic fashion against the pressure difference. For this sample, keeping the differential pressure between 1. 1 - 1. 3 MPa can reduce the permeability damage induced by <b>coal</b> <b>fines.</b> This study delivers fundamental understandings of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation and migration behaviours during the dewatering stage, which can provide useful guidelines to implement effective dewatering strategies to minimize production loss induced by <b>coal</b> <b>fines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> {{production}} {{and the impact of}} these fines on the permeability of two coals from the Bowen Basin, Australia, were performed at different flow conditions (single-phase water or gas, two-phase water and gas) and pressure conditions. The fines collected from each coal samples ranged in size from 1 mu m to 14 mu m. For both coal samples, during the first 50 h, the permeability decreases from 0. 005 mD and 0. 048 mD by 60. 9 % and 85 %, respectively, followed by gradual decline with fluctuations. By the end of water injection, the permeability drops by 88 % and 89 %, respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the counteraction between formation damage (cleats plugging and <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> settlement) and breakthrough of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> from the samples (widened cleats). It was found that <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> volumetric production is proportional to the third power of flow velocity once the flow paths for <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> are established. The critical flow velocities of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> production for both samples were also obtained. For hydrophobic coal, water-drive-gas two-phase flow introduces abrupt permeability loss due to <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation and migration. Furthermore, pauses (well shut-in) in the experiments cause slight permeability drops. A comparison between the two samples indicates that narrower and less connected cleating system results in more frequent <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation and migration, resulting in significant permeability fluctuations with general decreasing trend. Tortuosity of the cleats can enhance the deterioration in permeability by <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> behaviours. This study delivers fundamental understandings of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> generation and migration during the CSG production process, and useful guidelines are suggested to be implemented in the field to minimize production loss induced by <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> behaviours...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fines</b> are {{generated}} during both the dewatering and Coal Seam Gas (CSG) production stages.

60|$|The agent then {{conducted}} his {{visitors to}} the testing-house, where he showed them the process of testing the various qualities of tin ore offered, to the House for sale. First he weighed out twenty parts of the ore, which, as we have said, resembled snuff. This, he remarked, contained about five-sixths of pure tin, the remaining one-sixth being dross. He mixed it with four parts of <b>fine</b> <b>coal</b> dust, or culm, and added a little borax--these last ingredients being intended to expedite the smelting process. This compound was put into a crucible, and subjected to the intense heat of a small furnace for about twenty minutes. At {{the end of that}} time, the agent seized the crucible with a pair of tongs, poured the metal into an iron mould, and threw away the dross. The little mass of tin thus produced was about four inches long, by half an inch broad, and of a dull bluish-grey colour. It was then put into an iron ladle and melted, as one would melt lead when about to cast bullets, but it was particularly noteworthy here, that a very slight heat was required. To extract the metal from the tin ore, a fierce heat, long applied, was necessary, but a slight heat, continued for a few minutes, sufficed to melt the metal. This remelted metal was poured into a stone mould, where it lay like a bright little pool of liquid silver. In a few seconds it solidified, retaining its clear purity in all its parts.|$|E

30|$|The {{existence}} of <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> inhibits fracturing. The residual <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> in the wellbore {{needs to be}} cleaned up before fracturing to improve the subsequent fracturing effects and enhance the production of CBM wells.|$|R
30|$|During the {{operation}} of CBM wells, <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> are easily generated due {{to the rise of}} liquid level or pressure changes (Liu et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2009).

40|$|Abstract: Surface {{property}} plays a {{very important}} role on coal hydrophobicity which determines flotation behavior of <b>fine</b> <b>coals.</b> However, coal spontaneous combustion makes coal suffer both oxidation and high temperature heating processes. Coals from the outside of coal piles primarily suffer oxidation (or combustion process) while coals from the inside of coal piles primarily suffer high temperature heating process. It is necessary to investigate the changes in surface properties of coal before and after high temperature heating process. In this investigation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area (BET) and contact angle measurements were used to indicate the changes in surface properties of anthracite coal before and after high temperature heating process. Throughout this study, surface properties of coal changed significantly after high temperature heating process. Meanwhile, coal hydrophobicity can be also reduced after high temperature heating...|$|R

40|$|Permeability {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in {{the production}} of coal seam gas (CSG). Laboratory experiments have been carried out extensively to study the coal permeability. Typical approach includes injection of fluids (e. g. water and gas) through coal samples and permeability can be determined from measured pressure drop across the sample and flow rate. Some of these studies have demonstrated coal permeability variation during water/gas flow. These permeability variations have been attributed to physical blockage of flow paths by <b>fines</b> migration and/or <b>coal</b> creep. Investigation of these studies has indicated some limitations: (i) 	Effluent water was not characterized which could include characterization of produced fines, dissolved elements in the effluent water. (ii) 	Coal characterization (coal rank and mineralogy etc.) was not conducted so that a correlation between the permeability variation and <b>coal</b> and <b>fines</b> characteristics could not be investigated. This is an important missing information which can help understand the root causes for the permeability variation. (iii) 	The effect of coal creep was not separated from that of fines migration on the permeability variation. So, it was difficult to analyze and conclusively demonstrate the impact on coal permeability of each mechanism. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate to what degree fines migration is responsible for coal permeability variation during water flow. A systematic physical and analytical modeling approach is proposed for this purpose. The approach includes designed water flow tests, characterization of coal samples, analysis of effluent water and analytical modeling of permeability damage. The results demonstrate that permeability is affected by fines migration during water flow in coal. A good correlation between the permeability variation and fines production is observed. The <b>fines</b> produced from <b>coal</b> are found to be mainly coal and clay. Analytical calculations of the interaction energy between the observed <b>fines</b> and <b>coal</b> surface suggest that clay fines are easier to be mobilized than <b>coal</b> <b>fines.</b> Bituminous <b>coal</b> <b>fines</b> appear to mobilize more easily than anthracite <b>coal</b> <b>fines.</b> The analytical tool predicts reasonably the observed permeability variation...|$|R

But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of <b>fine</b> <b>coals</b> such as mine dust, slack coal, washing rejects and slurries, froth flotation method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal.
