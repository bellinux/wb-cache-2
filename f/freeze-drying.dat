5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, <b>freeze-drying,</b> and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by <b>freeze-drying</b> and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E

25|$|At {{freezing}} temperatures, {{water in}} the intercellular spaces of plant tissues freezes first, though the water may remain unfrozen until temperatures fall below 7nbsp&°C. After the initial formation of ice intercellularly, the cells shrink as water is lost to the segregated ice.

25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and <b>freeze-drying</b> allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. <b>Freeze-drying</b> by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the cultivation process of highly concentrated SW {{in order to}} effectively treat wastewater and to produce large amounts of yeast sludge biomass to reduce operational costs. With fed-batch cultivation using a 5 -L jar fermenter, controlling pH value at 5.0 with H 2 SO 4, 62.9 % of DOC, 38.4 % of DTN, and 44.5 % of DTP were stably removed from non-diluted BSW, and about 16.7  kg of <b>freeze-dry</b> yeast biomass was obtained. Furthermore, mixed with relatively thin SSW 1 : 1, removal ratios of DOC, DTN, and DTP were increased, and 14.4  kg of <b>freeze-dry</b> yeast biomass was obtained. Yeast sludge biomass generated in BSW and MSW contains about 60 % of crude protein. Thus, they are useful for yeast extract source and animal feed protein. Furthermore, using H 2 SO 4 to control pH supplied the wastewater with sulfur (S) appeared to raise the methionine content of yeast sludge biomass.|$|R

25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The <b>freeze-drying</b> process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
25|$|Bog Bodies {{are human}} remains {{which have been}} found in peat bogs in various {{locations}} around the world. They have been preserved naturally in varying degrees due to the specific conditions of peat bogs. Despite their natural preservation, these remains are sensitive to deterioration after being removed from their original locations. <b>Freeze-drying</b> is an accepted method of preserving bog bodies in museum collections. Some notable bog body discoveries include the Tollund Man of Denmark, the Elling Woman of Denmark, the Cashel Man of Ireland, the Huldremose Woman of Denmark, the Girl of the Uchter Moor of Germany, the Lindow Man of England, and the Yde Girl of the Netherlands.

500|$|Environment and {{situation}} are {{the crucial}} factors that determine how corpses decay. For instance, corpses will decay differently {{depending on the}} weather, {{the way they are}} buried, and the medium in which they are buried. Peat slows the decay of corpses. It was feared that, once Lindow Man was removed from that environment, which had preserved the body for nearly 2,000years, the remains would rapidly start to deteriorate, so steps were taken to insure preservation. After rejecting methods that had been used to maintain the integrity of other bog bodies, such as the [...] "pit-tanning" [...] used on Grauballe Man, which took a year and a half, scientists settled on <b>freeze-drying.</b> In preparation, the body was covered in a solution of 15% polyethylene glycol 400 and 85% water to prevent its becoming distorted.

2500|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be used to make aerogels/foams, either {{homogeneously}} or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace polystyrene-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce starch foams by using a <b>freeze-drying</b> technique. The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of wood-based pulp fibers is that the nanofibrills can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various <b>freeze-drying</b> and super critical [...] drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates. Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibrill suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibrill interaction in the foams. Cellulose nanowhiskers could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (>600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels. In another study by Aulin et al., the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by <b>freeze-drying</b> was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before <b>freeze-drying.</b> Chemical vapour deposition of a fluorinated silane was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the <b>freeze-drying</b> technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the <b>freeze-drying</b> technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrills dispersed inside. Olsson et al. demonstrated that these networks can be further impregnated with metalhydroxide/oxide precursors, which can readily be transformed into grafted magnetic nanoparticles along the cellulose nanofibers. The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1gram of water within a 60mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (>98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.|$|E
