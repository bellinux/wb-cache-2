40|$|Environmentalists and {{environmental}} scientists have criticized wind energy in various forums for its negative impacts on wildlife, especially birds. This article highlights that nuclear power and fossil-fuelled power systems have {{a host of}} environmental and wildlife costs as well, particularly for birds. Therefore, as a low-emission, low-pollution energy source, the wider use of wind energy can save wildlife and birds as it displaces these more harmful sources of electricity. The paper provides two examples: one relates to a calculation of avian fatalities across wind electricity, <b>fossil-fueled,</b> and nuclear <b>power</b> systems in the entire United States. It estimates that wind farms are responsible for roughly 0. 27 avian fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while nuclear power plants involve 0. 6 fatalities per GWh and <b>fossil-fueled</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are responsible for about 9. 4 fatalities per GWh.

40|$|Introduction] The way {{we produce}} food and {{generate}} energy substantially matters for major challenges of this century. Agricultural practices affect biodiversity, {{human health and}} quality of water; <b>fossil-fuel</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> drive Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emissions exacerbating global warming; and efficiency of both sectors co-determines {{how many people do}} have access to food and energy supply. Seen in this light, it seems plausible that both sectors are - at least in most industrial countries - widely regulated (see e. g. Sumner, Alston, and Glauber, 2010; Pearce, 2002). Indeed, externalities, public good characteristics, spillovers, and issues of just distribution are frequently cited to justify regulations. In such an environment and given rapid changes and developments of today 2 ̆ 019 s energy and food branches, it is an indispensable task of efficient governance to constantly monitor and assess technological innovations, either with respect to their eligibility to get supported or with respect to needs of restriction or prohibition.

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of any system {{depends on the}} definition of the boundaries of the system. For an electrical energy customer the {{efficiency of}} electric space heating is almost 100% because almost all purchased energy is converted to building heat (the only exception being fan noise and indication lights which demand very little electricity and virtually none at all when compared to the extremely large energy draw of the heating itself). However, if a power plant supplying electricity is included, the overall efficiency drops drastically. For example, a <b>fossil-fuel</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Even though the electric heater is 100% efficient, the amount of fuel needed to produce electric heat is more than if the fuel was burned in a furnace or boiler at the building being heated. If the same fuel could be used for space heating by a consumer, it would be more efficient overall to burn the fuel at the end user's building. On the other hand, replacing electric heating with fossil fuel burning heaters, isn't necessary good as it removes the ability to have renewable electric heating, this can be achieved by sourcing the electricity from a renewable source.|$|R
