500|$|The static {{pressure}} is obtained through a static port. [...] The static port {{is most often}} a <b>flush-mounted</b> hole on the fuselage of an aircraft, and is located where it can access the air flow in a relatively undisturbed area. [...] Some aircraft may have a single static port, while others may have more than one. [...] In situations where an aircraft {{has more than one}} static port, there is usually one located {{on each side of the}} fuselage. [...] With this positioning, an average pressure can be taken, which allows for more accurate readings in specific flight situations. [...] An alternative static port may be located inside the cabin of the aircraft as a backup for when the external static port(s) are blocked. [...] A pitot-static tube effectively integrates the static ports into the pitot probe. [...] It incorporates a second coaxial tube (or tubes) with pressure sampling holes on the sides of the probe, outside the direct airflow, to measure the {{static pressure}}. When the aircraft climbs, static pressure will decrease.|$|E

5000|$|Pushbutton vandal-resistant {{switches}} {{are frequently}} constructed {{of stainless steel}} or other durable materials, and are mounted into panels or housing boxes made out of strong materials, such as polycarbonate plastic, aluminium, or stainless steel. In some cases, the housing may be 1/4 in thick, to protect both the switch and the housing from attempts by vandals to damage the switch or housing using blunt force. The housing for vandal-proof switches is often secured using security screws (which cannot be unscrewed with regular screw drivers). The height of buttons in the panel is often minimized by using <b>flush-mounting,</b> {{to make it more}} difficult to pry them out, a design technique used in ATM banking machines that are located outside.|$|R
30|$|Appearance {{should not}} to be {{overlooked}} {{when it comes to}} installing cameras. If the cameras will be installed in an outdoor environment, large outdoor enclosures may invoke a sense of intimidation (see Figure 4 (a)). It is recommended to take into consideration the environment the cameras will be installed to decide whether discreetness or visibility are higher concerns. As opposed to surface-mounting (installing a camera directly on a ceiling surface), <b>flush-mounting</b> (cutting a hole and installing a camera in the ceiling with the optics exposed) will provide a more discreet and streamlined appearance, but will require permanent alteration to the installation locations. If a network is temporary, readers are recommended to consider the life expectancy of the network before opting for flush mounting.|$|R
50|$|While {{using the}} same two-box layout and proportions, the 1992 {{redesign}} of the E-Series was given a far more aerodynamic body than its predecessor. Although Ford utilized the longest forward body of any full-size van, the hood was angled downward slightly and the windshield raked back; if specified, all side window glass was <b>flush-mounted.</b> For the first time, the E-Series utilized <b>flush-mounted</b> wraparound taillights and <b>flush-mounted</b> headlights (the latter were an option, standard on Club Wagons). In addition, the E-Series was the first full-size van to utilize a center-mounted brake light.|$|E

30|$|While the {{selected}} Axis 215 camera offers an outdoor dome enclosure, a dilemma was faced {{as there were}} no discreet outdoor enclosures for them; {{we had to find}} a way to make the cameras relatively weatherproof to withstand humidity and moisture. By choosing the Axis 215, we had to compensate for the lack of an available outdoor enclosure and improvise using the supplied <b>flush-mount</b> enclosures with smoked domes and surface-mount enclosures with clear domes, both designed for indoor installation. The solution was to use the surface-mount enclosures and make them weather-resistant by sealing the plastic seams with silicone sealant. In addition, the clear domes were interchanged with the smoked domes. The end result was a non-threatening camera dome suitable for surface-mounting at any of the 37 locations (see Figure 4 (c)). Long-term effects of humidity, heat, and moisture on the cameras despite the sealed domes remains to be seen.|$|R
5000|$|By modern standards, the M1's {{feeding system}} is archaic, relying on clips to feed ammunition, {{and is the}} {{principal}} source of criticism of the rifle. Officials in Army Ordnance circles demanded a fixed, non-protruding magazine for the new service rifle. At the time, {{it was believed that}} a detachable magazine on a general-issue service rifle would be easily lost by U.S. soldiers (a criticism made of British soldiers and the Lee-Enfield 50 years previously), would render the weapon too susceptible to clogging from dirt and debris (a belief that proved unfounded with the adoption of the M1 Carbine), and that a protruding magazine would complicate existing manual-of-arms drills. As a result, inventor John Garand developed an [...] "en bloc" [...] clip system that allowed ammunition to be inserted from above, clip included, into the fixed magazine. While this design provided the requisite <b>flush-mount</b> magazine, the clip system increased the rifle's weight and complexity, and made only single loading ammunition possible without a clip.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} signals produced by Wheelock were the A-1 series of AC-powered, dual-projector electromechanical horns. In the early 1970s, Wheelock introduced the 31 (AC-powered) and 34 (DC-powered) series of electromechanical horns. Around 1976, Wheelock created the 7001 (2-wire, <b>flush-mount</b> DC), 7002 (2-wire, surface-mount DC), 34+WS (4-wire, surface-mount DC), and 7004 (2-wire, surface-mount AC) electromechanical horn/strobes. These were the first fire alarm signals to use xenon strobes instead of incandescent lights. The horn and strobe on the 7001 and 7002 models are wired in series, causing the horn to stutter when the strobe flashes. Around 1983, Wheelock redesigned the horn's grilles, making them vandal resistant. This product line became extremely popular among third-party security companies, such as Honeywell, Ademco, and Cerberus Pyrotronics (now part of Siemens AG). In 1994, Wheelock discontinued this series, because their low-intensity strobes {{did not meet the}} new light distribution requirements of the ADA. The 31T is still in production today for general signaling purposes.|$|R

50|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{it appears}} to be best to choose a probe size a few times larger than the ion Larmor radius. A point of contention is whether it is better to use proud probes, where the angle between the magnetic field and the surface is at least 15°, or <b>flush-mounted</b> probes, which are embedded in the plasma-facing components and generally have an angle of 1 to 5 °. Many plasma physicists feel more comfortable with proud probes, which have a longer tradition and possibly are less perturbed by electron saturation effects, although this is disputed. <b>Flush-mounted</b> probes, on the other hand, being part of the wall, are less perturbative. Knowledge of the field angle is necessary with proud probes to determine the fluxes to the wall, whereas it is necessary with <b>flush-mounted</b> probes to determine the density.|$|E

5000|$|Changes for 1972 {{included}} a revised grille without the central divider of the 1970 and 1971 items, new surface-mounted sidemarker lights {{rather than the}} previous <b>flush-mount</b> units, a new instrument cluster featuring a large rectangular speedometer and several small round gauges; the AM/FM radio option returned. The Demon had new fender-mounted metal [...] "Demon" [...] badges without the small devil character on the 1971 decals. The [...] "Demon" [...] decal on {{the rear of the}} car was replaced by Dodge and Dart emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid. Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character. A new optional single hood scoop replaced 1971's dual scoops, and was coupled with a hood paint blackout that had been standard on the 1971 high-trim/high-value Demon Sizzler model. Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly restyled center caps finished in a light argent (silver) paint. Demon production was substantially less than Duster's; this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon, especially V8 models.|$|R
2500|$|For 1970, the Valiant {{was carried}} over with detail changes, {{including}} a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while {{the remainder of the}} grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new [...] version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an EGR valve and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous <b>flush-mount</b> items.|$|R
40|$|The Legacy {{engine is}} a {{completely}} new design, transitional diesel engine, replacing the reciprocating engine with a rotary engine. The Legacy engine offers significant advances over conventional internal combustion engines in 1) power to weight ratio; 2) multiple fuel acceptance; 3) fuel economy; and 4) environmental compliance. These advances are achieved {{through a combination of}} innovative design geometry, rotary motion, aspiration simplicity, and manufacturing/part simplicity. The key technical challenge to the Legacy engineâs commercialization, and the focus of this project, was the development of a viable roton tip seal. The PST concept for the roton tip seal was developed into a manufacturable design. The design was evaluated using a custom designed and fabricated seal test fixture and further refined. This design was incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 A prototype and tested for achievable compression pressure. The Decision Point at the end of Phase 1 of the project (described below) was to further optimize the existing tip seal design. Enhancements to the tip seal design were incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Compression pressures adequate for compression ignition of diesel fuel were achieved, although not consistently in all combustion volumes. The variation in compression pressures was characterized versus design features. As the roton tip seal performance was improved, results pointed toward inadequate performance of the housing side seals. Enhancement of the housing side seal system was accomplished using a custom designed side seal test fixture. The design enhancements developed with the test fixture were also incorporated into the GEN 2. 5 B prototype and tested and evaluated using the iterative research strategy described below. Finally, to simplify the requirements for the roton tip seals and to enhance the introduction and combustion of fuel, a <b>flush-mount</b> fuel injector was designed, manufactured and demonstrated in the GEN 2. 5 B prototype...|$|R

40|$|The {{cylinder}} pressure diagram {{is a valuable}} source of information for reciprocating internal combustion engines. If processed, it provides information concerning the combustion process inside the engine cylinder. During this process, a problem that usually arises is the proper mounting of the pressure sensor on the cylinder head. The optimum is to <b>flush-mount</b> the transducer to the cylinder head {{so that it can}} be directly in contact with the gas. Unfortunately, in many cases, and mainly in small size, high speed commercial engines, this is not always possible. For this reason, the engineer must position the transducer in a location away from the cylinder head to bring it to continuous contact with the cylinder gas through a duct. From experiments, we find that this may result in errors in the measured values of the gas pressure that differ from the actual ones inside the combustion chamber. In the case of spark ignition engines, we face this problem by using pressure sensors mounted on the engine spark plug, but in the case of Diesel engines, we must mount the transducer separately. The main scope of the present work is to examine the effect of the transducer position on the measured pressure diagram in high speed diesel engines. For this purpose, in the present work, a theoretical investigation is conducted using a simulation model developed by the authors, where the unsteady Bow problem in the connecting pipeline from the combustion chamber to the transducer is solved using a finite difference scheme. A simple combustion model is used to simulate the operation of a high speed diesel engine at various conditions. The theoretical investigation involves the study of the effect of the connecting pipe geometry (diameter and length) and engine speed and load on the measured pressure diagram and on the parameters derived from it. From this investigation, important results are obtained that enable us to determine the magnitude of the error in pressure measurement that results from the positioning of the transducer away from the combustion chamber. The results reveal the limits within which the pressure measurements are reliable and may be possibly used to develop a method for correcting the measured pressure diagram.

40|$|Identification, analysis, {{and control}} of fluid-mechanically-generated sound from models of {{aircraft}} and automobiles in special low-noise, semi-anechoic wind tunnels are an important research endeavor. Such studies can also be done in aerodynamic wind tunnels that have hard walls if phased microphone arrays are used {{to focus on the}} noise-source regions and reject unwanted reflections or background noise. Although {{it may be difficult to}} simulate the total flyover or drive-by noise in a closed wind tunnel, individual noise sources can be isolated and analyzed. An acoustic and aerodynamic study was made of a 7 -percent-scale aircraft model in a NASA Ames 7 -by- 10 -ft (about 2 -by- 3 -m) wind tunnel for the purpose of identifying and attenuating airframe noise sources. Simulated landing, takeoff, and approach configurations were evaluated at Mach 0. 26. Using a phased microphone array mounted in the ceiling over the inverted model, various noise sources in the high-lift system, landing gear, fins, and miscellaneous other components were located and compared for sound level and frequency at one flyover location. Numerous noise-alleviation devices and modifications of the model were evaluated. Simultaneously with acoustic measurements, aerodynamic forces were recorded to document aircraft conditions and any performance changes caused by geometric modifications. Most modern microphone-array systems function in the frequency domain in the sense that spectra of the microphone outputs are computed, then operations are performed on the matrices of microphone-signal cross-spectra. The entire acoustic field at one station in such a system is acquired quickly and interrogated during postprocessing. Beam-forming algorithms are employed to scan a plane near the model surface and locate noise sources while rejecting most background noise and spurious reflections. In the case of the system used in this study, previous studies in the wind tunnel have identified noise sources up to 19 dB below the normal background noise of the wind tunnel. Theoretical predictions of array performance are used to minimize the width and the side lobes of the beam pattern of the microphone array for a given test arrangement. To capture flyover noise of the inverted model, a 104 -element microphone array in a 622 -mm-diameter cluster was installed in a 19 -mm-thick poly(methyl methacrylate) plate in the ceiling of the test section of the wind tunnel above the aircraft model (see Figure 1). The microphones were of the condenser type, and their diaphragms were mounted flush in the array plate, which was recessed 12. 7 mm into the ceiling and covered by a porous aromatic polyamide cloth (not shown in the figure) to minimize boundary-layer noise. This design caused the level of flow noise to be much less than that of <b>flush-mount</b> designs. The drawback of this design was that the cloth attenuated sound somewhat and created acoustic resonances that could grow to several dB at a frequency of 10 kHz...|$|R
