40|$|The {{effect of}} cycocel, {{gibberellic}} acid and kinetin was investigated on the seed germination and seedling growth of C. lanatus. Cycocel favoured germination <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> and largely inhibited it in diffuse light. The growth of radicule and hypocotyl was promoted only <b>in</b> total <b>darkness.</b> Gibberellic acid accelerated {{the pace of}} germination <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> more than diffuse light in the firs 24 hours. The growth of the radicule {{as well as the}} hypocotyl was more in diffuse light, whereas only the radicule indicated an enhanced growth <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> <b>in</b> low concentration. The known influence of this chemical on the shoot elongation largely remained ineffective. In kinetin cent percent germination was obtained <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> which was not so in diffuse light, except for high concentration. It enhanced the pace of germination <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> <b>in</b> the first 24 hors. The seedling growth was promoted in diffuse light, while it was inhibited <b>in</b> total <b>darkness.</b> The increase <b>in</b> the size of the cotyledons took place only in diffuse light. It became apparent that kinetin and gibberellic acid could partly substitute the requirements of total darkness for seed germination in this species...|$|R

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} were trapped <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> {{for several hours}} inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice. Questions were raised at the time about the ability of the train and tunnel electronics to withstand the mix of snow, salt and ice which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E
5|$|At 00:30 {{hours on}} 28 March the convoy {{crossed over the}} shoals {{at the mouth of}} the Loire estuary, with Campbeltown {{scraping}} the bottom twice.

5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E

5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. <b>In</b> <b>darkness</b> the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E

5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active {{for a few hours}} <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b> They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Air Force {{practice}} of harassing German ground forces using antiquated Polikarpov Po-2 and R-5 biplanes {{at night to}} drop flares and fragmentation bombs, inspired the Luftwaffe to form its own StÃ¶rkampfstaffeln (harassment squadrons). On 23 July 1942, Junkers offered the Ju 87 B-2, R-2 and R-4s with Flammenvernichter ("flame eliminators"). On 10 November 1943, the RLM GL/C-E2 Division finally authorised the design in directive No. 1117. This new equipment made the Ju 87 more difficult to detect from the ground <b>in</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur <b>in</b> <b>darkness</b> or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E

40|$|The {{flowering}} {{behavior of}} two cultural varieties of Fagopyrum esculentum Moench aseptically cultured <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> was studied. The {{effect on the}} flower initiation of some chemical substances added to sterilized dry seeds was also investigated. Low temperature {{was found to be}} more suitable for flower initiation in buckwheat plants. 2 -Thiouracil promoted flower initiation at high temperature <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> and inhibited it at any temperatures examined under light conditions. Sucrose promoted flower initiation at higher temperatures than 15 Â°. Lithium chloride and peptone inhibited flower initiation only at high temperature. Indoleacetic acid, gibberellin and kinetin had no effect on flower initiation <b>in</b> total <b>darkness.</b> It is postulated that in the flowering response the primary reaction may be connected with the metabolism of sucrose and ribonucleic acid. Since the discovery of flower initiation <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> <b>in</b> Raphanus sativus L. by TASHIMA (1), many experiments have been done <b>in</b> total <b>darkness</b> with some success in inducing flowering (2 - 8). In short day plants such as Pharbitis Nil Chois. (morning glory) and Cuscuta japonica (dodder), it has also been ascertained that they are capable of initiating flower primordia <b>in</b> total <b>darkness,</b> i. e. independently of light condition (9, 10). By using aseptic culture of buckwheat, the present experiments were designed to study the effect of temperature, sucrose and some growth substances on flower initiation <b>in</b> total <b>darkness.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS The materials used in the present experiments were two cultural varieties of Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, "Shinano No. 1 " and "Hashi-kamiwase".
