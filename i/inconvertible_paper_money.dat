The {{experience of}} the latter illustrates as well as any, [...] perhaps, not only {{the general theory of}} inconvertible paper, but [...] the device of supporting the paper by paying interest upon the [...] notes. Although the issues since 1690 had depreciated, in 1702 [...] £10,000 more notes were issued, because, as it was said, there was [...] a scarcity of money. It is always noticeable that the more issues [...] of paper money there are made, the more there is a cry of [...] scarcity, much like the thirst of a hard drinker after the first [...] exhilaration has passed off. On the new issues five per cent [...] interest was paid, and even excises and imposts were set aside as [...] security for their payment. The year 1709 saw a new expedition to [...] Canada, and saw also the broken promises of the province, when [...] £20,000 more notes were put out; the collection of the taxes with [...] which to pay the notes was deferred in 1707 for two years; in 1709 [...] deferred for four years; in 1710 for five years; in 1711 for six [...] years. By 1712 they had depreciated thirty per cent, when the [...] charm of legal tender was thrown around them, but to no purpose. [...] The idea of value was not associated with them in people’s minds, [...] and they put no faith in promises. The usual result took place. [...] People divided politically on the money question, and parties [...] began to agitate for banks which should issue notes based on real [...] estate, or for loans from the state to private persons at interest [...] to be paid annually. Such facts show the train of evils following [...] the first innocent departure from the maintenance of a currency [...] equivalent to coin. The people forgot, or did not know, the nature [...] of money, or the offices it performed. They did not understand [...] that creating paper money did not create wealth. This experiment [...] closed only in 1750 (March 31st), when the province had courage [...] enough to resume specie payments. The effect was to transfer the [...] West India trade from paper-issuing colonies to Massachusetts, and [...] to produce a steady prosperity in her business interests.|$|E

He had been a convinced free-trader, but gradually moved into the opposite camp, and {{was responsible for the}} first New South Wales protectionist tariff. When Parkes resigned in October 1891 Dibbs came into power in a time of great financial stress. He went to England in June 1892 on a borrowing mission, not only as the representative of New South Wales but also of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and carried out his negotiations successfully. During the banking crisis of May 1893 he showed himself to be a firm leader, saving the situation at Sydney by giving the banks power to issue <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money</b> for a period, although most of them failed to take advantage and went bankrupt. In 1893, his electoral reform removed rural over-representation. He was elected as the member for Tamworth in 1894.

5000|$|The {{formation}} of fictitious capital is, for Marx, {{linked to the}} wider contradiction between the financial system in capitalism and its monetary basis. Marx writes: [...] "With the development of interest-bearing capital and the credit system, all capital seems to double itself, and sometimes treble itself, by the various modes in which the same capital, or perhaps even the same claim on a debt, appears in different forms in different hands. The greater portion of this 'money-capital' is purely fictitious. All the deposits, {{with the exception of}} the reserve fund, are merely claims on the banker, which, however, never exist as deposits." [...] The expansion of the credit system can, in periods of capitalist expansion, be beneficial for the system; but in periods of economic crisis and uncertainty, capitalists tend, Marx argues, to look to the security of the [...] "money-commodity" [...] (gold) as the ultimate measure of value. Marx tends to assume the convertibility of paper money into gold. However, the modern system of <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money,</b> backed by the authority of states, poses greater problems. Here, in periods of crisis, [...] "the capitalist class appears to have a choice between devaluing money or commodities, between inflation or depression. In the event that monetary policy is dedicated to avoiding both, it will merely end up incurring both".|$|E
60|$|In {{order that}} the value of the {{currency}} may be secure from being altered by design, and may be as little as possible liable to fluctuation from accident, the articles least liable of all known commodities to vary in their value, the precious metals, have been made in all civilized countries the standard of value for the circulating medium; and no paper currency ought to exist of which the value can not be made to conform to theirs. Nor has this fundamental maxim ever been entirely lost sight of, even by the governments which have most abused the power of creating <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper.</b> If they have not (as they generally have) professed an intention of paying in specie at some indefinite future time, they have at least, by giving to their paper issues the names of their coins, made a virtual, though generally a false, profession of intending to keep them at a value corresponding to that of the coins. This is not impracticable, even with an <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper.</b> There is not, indeed, the self-acting check which convertibility brings with it. But there is a clear and unequivocal indication by which to judge whether the currency is depreciated, and to what extent. That indication is the price of the precious metals. When holders of paper can not demand coin to be converted into bullion, and when there is none left in circulation, bullion rises and falls in price like other things; and if it is above the mint price—if an ounce of gold, which would be coined into the equivalent of [$18.60], is sold for [$20 or $25] in paper—the value of the currency has sunk just that much below what the value of a metallic currency would be. If, therefore, the issue of <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> were subjected to strict rules, one rule being that, whenever bullion rose above the mint price, the issues should be contracted until the market price of bullion and the mint price were again in accordance, such a currency would not be subject to any of the evils usually deemed inherent in an <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} the theoretical foundation on which we can understand the difference between the standard monetary system and the fiat money system, by focusing the accessibility to the medium of exchange. We analyzed the economic cost and economic distance to travel from the initial point (=before conducting the exchange) to the desired situation (=after the exchange). We concluded that the standard-goods should not be selected from the goods with high intrinsic value because they help improve the real economic activities. This clarifies the reason for the transition of the money from ancient times to modern ages. However, when one of real goods is selected as a monetary standard, opportunity cost of the monetary-use is inevitable, even if its intrinsic value is small. This determines the upper limit of efficiency of standard money system. On the other hand, an <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money,</b> purely nominal, doesn't generate such an opportunity cost, because it is not based on any real goods. In this sense, there is a difference between fiat and standard money...|$|E

6000|$|... [A] {{new issue}} would again {{set in motion}} the same train of {{consequences}} by which the gold coin had already been expelled. The metals would, as before, be required for exportation, and would be for that purpose demanded from the banks, to {{the full extent of}} the superfluous notes, which thus could not possibly be retained in circulation. If, indeed, the notes were inconvertible, there would be no such obstacle to the increase in their quantity. An <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> acts in the same way as a convertible, while there remains any coin for it to supersede; the difference begins to manifest itself when all the coin is driven from circulation (except what may be retained for the convenience of small change), and the issues still go on increasing. When the paper begins to exceed in quantity the metallic currency which it superseded, prices of course rise; things which were worth $25 in metallic money become worth $30 in <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper,</b> or more, as the case may be. But this rise of price will not, as in the cases before examined, stimulate import and discourage export. The imports and exports are determined by the metallic prices of things, not by the paper prices; and it is only when the paper is exchangeable at pleasure for the metals that paper prices and metallic prices must correspond.|$|R

This paper- Paper or Gold discusses the validity of human society giving importance to <b>paper</b> <b>money.</b> · We all know that the human race always believes in experimenting and {{we as a society}} tend to maximize benefits by minimizing risks.

This paper begins with an outline on trade and its importance. Trade has been very important, as it has aided many great civilizations to open doors for great conquests and for enhancing their economic prowess. · It is worth noting that the total supply of USD has increased by 30 % over the past 3 years whereas the total supply of gold has grown by less than 6 % over the same period. Gold is treated and internationally traded as a precious commodity, but in times of crisis and recession, it has been more often than not treated and traded as currency. The choice between commodity and <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> is that between determined or undetermined exchange values of the money. · In the aftermath of the gold standard and the inception of the Bretton woods agreement the currencies were defined in terms of their gold reserves. Gold is treated and internationally traded as a precious commodity, but in times of crisis and recession, it has been more often than not treated and traded as currency. It has been vehemently argued that gold is money as it performs the primary functions of money- unit of account, store of value, universal acceptance and mobility. · This tradition of classical economics stands solidly behind commodity money standard, like silver or gold, as the very embodiment of sound money.

40|$|The {{conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy, a most controversial subject in eco-nomics, {{is as yet}} unsettled. The rules-versus-discretion debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960 s, and between new classicals and new Keynesians nowadays, is but the latest instance of an academic argument {{that goes back to}} the Currency-versus-Banking School contro-versy and beyond. At the center of this discussion are the main features of the model analyzing the transmission and effects of variations in the money stock on output and the price level. In an early dispute on this issue Thomas Attwood opposed John Stu-art Mill. In several papers and pamphlets, as well as in parliamentary speeches and testimony, Attwood argued for the pursuit of full employ-ment through the active management of an <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money.</b> Mill strongly criticized this approach on various grounds and rejected the possibility of stimulating output through monetary impulses. This controversy is well known, yet it is worth revisiting for several reasons. First, economists are divided on their assessment of Mill’s view, which indeed poses a puzzle since, while in the early essay “Of the Influence of Consumption upon Production ” (1844; but written around 1830) he admits the effectiveness of money supply changes, he does not in the Principles (1848). Second, a closer look at Mill’s arguments clarifies the different approaches to money within the classical school. Third, thi...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{relationship}} between love and money in the context of the American Dream in F. Scott. Fitzgeraldʼs The Great Gatsby. In general, those who try to buy or sell love tend to be punished in the end in American novels, such as Kate Croy in The Wings of the Dove, Lily Bart in The House of Mirth and Carrie Meeber in Sister Carrie. However, love and money in The Great Gatsby are closely related with each other in terms of the concept of the self-made man who pursues success in both love and money. By employing the concepts used in the money system as metaphors such as convertible paper money, <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money</b> and trust, I examine how Gatsbyʼs love for Daisy is harmonized with his money-making and how the process of his money-making equals that of making his “self. ” In the end, Gatsby is killed and his American dream seems to fail. However, this is neither his failure nor a punishment for Gatsby as the system of the American Dream requires some kind of difference to maintain itself: we gain profit from difference but difference vanishes through gaining profit; therefore, to retain profit, we have to keep difference. In his narrative, Nick Carraway tries to underline the gap between Daisy in the present and Daisy in the past to avoid the restoration of the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy, which, as a result, prolongs our expectation for the fulfillment of the American Dream. 論文Article...|$|E
40|$|Marx's {{contributions}} to monetary theory {{have generally been}} somewhat neglected and, if they were paid any attention at all, they have been rather severely criticized, even by Marxist economists. It should be emphasized, however, that they are central to Marx's view of the functioning of commodity producing (i. e., market) economies and are inextricably bound up with his theory of value. From Marx's analysis of the functions of money and credit and his reflections on the rate of interest it is concluded that his adherence to the labour theory of value could not but result in his embracing the Banking School ideas, and that his theory of money shows all the weaknesses of the Banking School, plus some that are peculiar to the labour theory of value. E. g. his proposition that causality runs from prices to quantity of money in a system with full-blooded coins, but {{the other way round}} in a system with <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money,</b> cannot be given any satisfying micro-economic justification; nor does his theory admit of any influence of monetary policy on aggregate spending. Moreover, the labour theory of value leaves Marx without a theory of the rate of interest. His analysis of money as the "universal equivalent" makes one wonder why he did not consider the consequences of the tansformation problem for the money commodity. To his credit, Marx very clearly saw why Say's law of markets in the form of Say's identity is not valid in a monetary economy. Marx's theory of money {{turns out to be a}} weak construction, because it cannot be made consistent with any acceptable assumptions about microeconomic decision making.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{that forms the}} substance of this thesis has been conducted on historical lines. An intensive study of the Currency and Banking developments in the old Cape Colony between the years 1782 and about 1825, reveals the typical currency development from a money economy to a credit economy. Prior {{to the beginning of}} the nineteenth century, there were no commercial banks with the result that there was no credit structure built up on a metallic reserve whereby the amount available for trade could have been multiplied several times. This study of the origin and development of the <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> rixdollar will enable us to form a correct judgement of the various methods adopted to supply the public exigencies, and the effects of such tampering, in destroying the credit as well as the value of the currency. It will be seen that inconvertible notes can be issued without any limit and when the issuers have a free hand, their value depends solely on the moderation of the issue. The inflation of an <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> currency may be either automatic or deliberate. The authorities may issue increased currency to meet what they believe to be trade demands, but, in fact, they may issue more than enough and the result will be unconscious inflation. The authorities will argue that more currency is needed because prices are rising, while their opponents will contend that prices are rising because too much currency is being issued. Further, this investigation will reveal the dangers of Government Banking and Government interference in the sphere of currency; the ease with which paper is issued and the difficulty of stopping the issue of notes. Inconvertible notes may be limited to an amount which can circulate without any depreciation, but in that case there can be no more of them than there would have been if they had been convertible, and no object is served by their being inconvertible. Generally, it may be said that the immediate cause of resort to <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> has almost always been the pressure of public finance. Funds must be raised in some way, and an additional issue of inconvertible notes affords the easiest, though not the best, method of raising them.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Marx assumed in Capital that money is a {{produced}} commodity, such as gold. However, the question remains open: was this assumption an essential part of Marx’s theory or just a historical contingency, which Marx assumed because he was trying to explain the actual capitalist economy in the 19 th century. Some critics have argued that money must be a commodity in Marx’s theory as a theoretical necessity (e. g. Lavoie 1986), and argue that the fact that money is no longer a commodity in today’s economy contradicts Marx’s theory. These critics conclude that Marx’s theory of money is invalid, or is no longer applicable to modern capitalism with non-commodity money. In considering this criticism, it is important to distinguish between the different functions of money (which is not always done), and especially between the functions of measure of value and means of circulation. It is clear that money as means of circulation {{does not have to be}} a commodity in Marx’s theory, as Marx himself emphasized (Marx 1867, pp. 221 - 27, and Marx 1859, pp. 107 - 22). The only question is whether money must be a commodity in Marx’s theory in its function as measure of value. I argued in Moseley (2005 a) that money does not have to be a commodity in Marx’s theory, even in its function of measure of value. The measure of value does not itself have to possess value. <b>Inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money</b> (not backed by gold in any way) can also function as the measure of value. In order to function as the measure of value, a particular thing must be accepted by commodity-owners as the general equivalent, i. e. as directly exchangeable with all other commodities. Until the 1930 s, capitalists required that the general equivalent (and hence the measure of value) had to be a commodity, or at least convertible into a commodity at legally defined rates. However, in the Great Depression it became impossible to maintain the convertibility of paper money into commodity money. Convertibility required tight monetary policy, which was making the depression worse. In order to escape this “cross of gold”...|$|E
30|$|From around 1880 {{until the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, the gold standard served as role model for the international currency system. During this era of the classical gold standard, the definition of the currency value in terms of gold—the so-called mint-par—gave rise to officially fixed exchange rates. Nevertheless, the rates on the foreign exchange markets did move to some degree. One reason was that international gold shipments, which enforced the mint-par, were costly, wherefore the market exchange rate could fluctuate within a band of gold-arbitrage inactivity (see e.g. Clare 1895, ch. 7). An ongoing debate is still trying to determine the width of this band, which was delimited by the so-called gold-points. There are several reasons why this {{has turned out to be}} challenging including the numerous, time-varying cost components to transport gold across countries (Clare 1902, pp. 78 – 79; Canjels et al. 2004, p. 869), or the complications arising when triangular gold arbitrage is possible (Coleman 2007). 1 To nevertheless provide some rough values, for the French and the Belgian franc, contemporaneous sources set the upper and lower gold-points at, respectively, 25.12 Fcs/£ and 25.32 Fcs/£ (Clare 1895, p. 126; Tate 1908, p. 51), for the Dutch guilder at 12.05 Fl/£ and 12.15 Fl/£ (Tate, 1908, p. 328), and for the German mark at 20.32 M/£ and 20.53 M./£ (Clare 1895, p. 131) reflecting deviations of between 0.2 and 0.7 per cent from the mint-pars of, respectively, 25.22 Fcs/£, 12.07 Fl/£, and 20.43 M/£. Furthermore, even in its heyday, the gold standard was not a homogeneous system. In Europe, Britain and Germany came closest to the theoretical ideal of a freely convertible monometallic currency backed by gold, followed by Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where the conversion of the local currency into gold was subject to some restrictions (see Eichengreen 2008, pp. 20 ff.). Still, for decades, these relatively wealthy and financially advanced European nation states managed to anchor the exchange rate to the mint-par, which arguably implied that the remaining, small fluctuations on the foreign exchange market were primarily a reaction to international differences in interest (discount) rates (Clare 1902, p. 94). Conversely, the currency systems of other European countries were at most incompletely associated with the gold standard. For example, aside from a short period in the 1880 s, the Italian mint-par of 25.22 lire/£ was never officially instituted (Eichengreen 2008, p. 17). In Spain, Portugal, or Russia, substantial parts of the currency consisted of <b>inconvertible</b> <b>paper</b> <b>money</b> (Clare 1895, pp. 157 – 160). Austria-Hungary had essentially a freely floating currency until the end of the 1880 s, and undertook several monetary reforms during the 1890 s to gradually stabilise the exchange rate against gold around the year 1900 (see Von Mises 1909; Flandreau and Komlos 2006). The exchange rates of all these countries were relatively instable (Einzig 1962, 198 – 199) and reacted to fluctuations in international trade, or changes in foreign indebtedness (Clare 1902, p. 94).|$|E
