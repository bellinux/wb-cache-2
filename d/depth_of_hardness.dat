Milled tricalcium phosphate (TCP), a new calcium-phosphate-releasing material, is crystalline in nature, suggesting it to be strong. In the present study, we investigated the use of a TCP-filled composite resin as a possible tooth restorative-material. An experimental TCP-based composite was prepared using monomer with a mixture of 34. 3 percent by mass of EBPADMA, 34. 2 percent by mass of HmDMA, and 30. 5 percent by mass of HEMA. TCP fillers were added to the monomer mixture at different levels (30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent, and 60 percent by weight). A universal testing machine (Sintech Renew 1121; Instron Engineering Corp., Canton, MA) was used to measure the compressive strength and modulus. FTIR was used to measure the degree <b>of</b> conversion. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cure was determined according to the ISO standards for dental resin 4049 using the scrapping technique. Knoop hardness numbers were obtained by a microhardness tester (M- 400; Leco Co., St. Joseph, MI). The viscosities of the experimental resin were determined in a viscometer (DV-II+ Viscometer; Brookfield, Middleboro, MA). The data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A 5 -percent significance level was used for all the tests. Resin composites with 30 -percent TCP filler showed the highest compressive strength and hardness values. Also, this group showed the lowest degree of conversion. Resin composites with 60 -percent TCP filler showed the highest degree of conversion.

50|$|This {{approach}} has undergone numerous modifications since its inception. Most recently, Jha et al. {{found that the}} Korsunsky work-of-indentation approach measures the nominal <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> a material which {{is defined as the}} maximum load divided by the area of maximum contact. The nominal <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> a material is fundamentally different than its true hardness (determined by the Oliver-Pharr method), but the two concepts are interrelated. Jha et al. derived an expression that determines the true <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> a material from its nominal counterpart. In doing so, they employed a dimensionless energy-based parameter that relates the contact depth to the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> penetration. For a soft material, the difference between the contact depth and the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> penetration is small, and hence its nominal and true hardness values are practically the same. For a harder material these two types <b>of</b> <b>hardness</b> are remarkably different as the difference between them is relatively large. The model proposed by Jha et al. in its current form is applicable when the indenter is ideally sharp or when the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> penetration is sufficiently large in comparison to the indenter tip radius. The advantage of the modified work-of-indentation {{is that it does not}} require the computation of contact area, which is the main limitation of the conventional Oliver-Pharr method.

The light curing units used were either a conventional halogen curing unit (Elipar TriLight [3 M/ESPE] for 40 seconds), a high-power halogen curing unit (Astralis 10 [Ivoclar Vivadent] for 20 seconds), a plasma arc curing unit (Aurys [Degré K] for 10 seconds or 20 seconds) or different light emitting diode (LED) curing units (Elipar FreeLight I [3 M/ESPE] for 40 seconds, Elipar FreeLight II [3 M/ESPE] for 20 seconds, LuxOmax [Akeda] for 40 seconds, e-Light [GC] for 12 seconds or 40 seconds). <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> cure under the ceramic discs was assessed according to ISO 4049, and VHN at 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm distance from the ceramic disc bottom was determined (ISO 6507 - 1). Medians and the 25 th and 75 th percentiles were determined for each group (n= 10), and statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney-U-test (p < or = 0. 05). The results showed that increasing ceramic disc thickness had a negative effect on the curing <b>depth</b> and <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> all light curing units, with hardness decreasing dramatically under the 2 -mm thick discs using LuxOmax, e-Light (12 seconds) or Aurys (10 seconds or 20 seconds). The use of a self-curing catalyst is recommended over the light-curable portion only, because it produced an equivalent or greater <b>hardness</b> and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cure with all light polymerization modes...|$|R

Strengthening laser pro-cessing is directed, basically, to increase <b>of</b> surface <b>hardness</b> <b>of</b> piston rings. The method of distribution of microhardness on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the strengthened layer of piston rings is given. The mathematical models {{which can be}} used for calculation and a choice of optimum modes of laser processing of working surfaces of piston rings are received...|$|R

These models were developed using an efficient {{design of experiments}} in terms of machining and tool geometry variables. The machining variables were the cutting speed, feed and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cut. The tool geometry variables were the nose radius, side cutting edge angle, included angle, and the hone level on the side cutting edge. King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabi...|$|R
