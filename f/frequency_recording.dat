40|$|Today’s {{ultrafiltration}} processes use permeate flow reversal {{to remove}} fouling deposits on the feed side of ultrafiltration membranes. We report an as effective method: {{the opening and}} rapid closing of a valve on the permeate side of an ultrafiltration module. The sudden valve closure generates pressure fluctuations due to fluid inertia and {{is commonly known as}} “water hammer”. Surface water was filtrated in hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes with a small (5 %) crossflow. Filtration experiments above sustainable flux levels (> 125 l (m 2 h) − 1) show that a periodic closure of a valve on the permeate side improves filtration performance as a consequence of reduced fouling. It was shown that this effect depends on flux and actuation frequency of the valve. The time period that the valve was closed proved to have no effect on filtration performance. The pressure fluctuations generated by the sudden stop in fluid motion due to the valve closure are responsible for the effect of fouling reduction. High <b>frequency</b> <b>recording</b> of the dynamic pressure evolution shows water hammer related pressure fluctuations to occur in the order of 0. 1 bar. The pressure fluctuations were higher at higher fluxes (higher velocities) which is in agreement with the theory. They were also more effective at higher fluxes with respect to fouling mitigation.

In this study the wind data was used from the three-hour <b>frequency</b> <b>recording</b> of 10 -year period (2002 - 2011). To predict the occurrence probability of each wind speed, the two-parameter Weibull function was used. The goodness of fit test by Chi-Square test showed that the wind speed distribution is not represented by the typical two- parameter Weibull function for all the months. Weibull probability density function has a good fit for eleven months, but for the 9 th month of the year (September), it is not fitted. Thus, four-parameter Weibull probability function has been developed to analyze the wind speed frequency distribution in that region for the mentioned months. The electrical energy consumption of agricultural water wells in the region was also calculated for the desired periods of the year. Energy demand and energy supply were matched. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 18. 0. 0, MATLAB 7. 13. 0. 564 and WIDOGRAPHER 3. 0. 2. The results show that in Broujerd, to exploit the wind energy at all times of the year, it is necessary to have at least 39 turbines of 2300 kW with 99 meters tower. If the desired turbines are used, there will be extra energy and also, agriculture will be continued towards sustainable development...|$|E

Seven subjects (12 ears) with moderate sensorineural hearing loss between 15 and 18 years of ages were enrolled in the study. 48 behavioural and ASSR thresholds were obtained across the frequencies of 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz.

Detailed ground-truth information obtained for the evaluation included plant species <b>frequency</b> <b>recording</b> and plant and soil sampling along a series of transects located across known mineralized zones and across spectral anomalies detected on the photography. Overlays of the spectral signature units, including those subjected to enhancement techniques, were prepared and correlated with the ground-truth data and a number of microdensitometer scan lines measuring the optical density within each of the eight spectral bands of the multispectral photography. The spectral signatures of vegetation, and especially the distinct spectral signature of geobotanically anomalous plant communities forming surface expression of mineralized bedrock and related geochemical soil anomalies, are best displayed on false colour infra-red photography which covers the visible and near infra-red part of the spectrum in which plant reflectivity is most sensitive, consequently yielding most information. Ground-truth investigations, confirming the interpretation of infra-red spectral signatures, reveal the composition of anomalous and background vegetation units and indicatethe influence of the mineral status of the soil, relief, drainage and lithology on plant species distribution. Over mineralized terrain, higher reflectivity in all spectral bands and especially the true colour green, panchromatic green and false colour infra-red are recorded by microdensitometer optical density measurements which positively correlate with the above average concentrations of metal in the indicator plants and surface soils. In the semi-arid environment of North West Queensland, the use of multispectral photography, in conjunction with detailed field studies, is shown to have application in the study of vegetation associations and plant conmunities forming surface expression of characteristic ground conditions. The recognition of geobotanical anomalies and differences in soil and plant reflectivity indicative of bedrock mineralization offers considerable promise in mineral exploration for the detection of ore bodies. <p...|$|E
40|$|Bioimpedance {{spectrometry}} {{was applied}} to study cell viability and pEGFP plasmid-transfection efficiency in electroporation (EP) of 20, 000 HeLa cells with 0. 3 mu g DNA in 90 mu l low conductivity 0. 32 M sucrose medium of pH 7. 5. Monopolar rectangular pulses, of field strength 75 V/mm, and pulse length 0. 1 ms were applied in 1 - 16 repetitions with a 10 -sec pause interval between pulses. Surviving cells were stained by crystal violet and counted using a confocal microscope. Transfected cells were fixed with 10 % formaldehyde and counted as green spots in a fluorescence microscope. In the present investigation we used the method of bioimpedance spectrometry to analyze the effect of EP on survival and transfection ratio of cells in suspension. DC and low-frequency AC currents preferably pass through the medium due to the high impedance of the cell membrane. At frequencies above 10 kHz the impedance of the cell membrane starts to decrease and the impedance value of the cell suspension approach a lower limit value R-infinity at infinite <b>frequency.</b> <b>Recording</b> of electrical impedance spectra of cells in culture was performed over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 125 kHz, allowing separation of the contribution from extracellular space {{and that of the}} cell membranes. A parallel resistance capacitance model of the cell suspension was used to evaluate the response of applying EP pulses. The values of the collective membrane resistance R-M decay exponentially (r(2) = 0. 995) with the number of applied pulses. The ratio of the extrapolated value of the intact membrane resistance before pulsing, R-M,(O), and the value R-M,R-N after each pulse makes an index of the effect of electroporation on the cells. The ratio R-M,R-N/R-M,(O) as well as the relative change of the dissipation factor, tan delta, on the "Loss Change Index" (LCI) fits well a dose-response model (r(2) = 0. 98) with the number of applied pulses. The changes in the model parameters membrane resistance Delta R-M = [1 - R-M,(N) /R-M,o] and loss factor [1 - tan delta(O) /tan Omega(N) ] correlate well with the transfection ratio and fraction of dead cells. Those parameters were used for power-assisted electroporation in monitoring, controlling, and optimizing the EP procedure...|$|E
40|$|The shallow {{subsurface}} of {{the earth}} is an extremely important geological zone that yields much of our water resources, supports our agriculture and ecosystems. Safe and effective management of our natural resources is a major challenge, that is, not to overexploit and pollute the aquifer systems. The hydrogeophysics discipline has emerged {{in recent years to}} investigate the potential that geophysical methods hold for providing quantitative information about subsurface hydrogeological parameters and processes. Water is essential for life. It has been {{and will continue to be}} a hot topic in both the political and scientific fields for years to come. Chapter two, Hydrogeophysics, aims to review the actual state of the hydrogeophysical discipline showing the paramount perspectives of the geophysical methods applied to the hydrogeology discipline. Hydrogeophysical importance relies on its multidisciplinarity. That is, the joint interpretation of geophysical and hydrogeological data to get better approach and more constrained/reliable hydrogeologic models. The principal geophysical methods that have actually been applied to hydrogeology problems are reviewed, as well as their challenges, limitations and concerns. Electric and electromagnetic methods that provide electrical resistivity models have been examined in detail. The electrical resistivity is considered, given that this property is highly controlled by the hydrogeological properties of the media (lithology, porous structure, water content and quality). However, the complexity of the property contribution of the geophysical response made the transfer step from geophysical model to hydrological properties a complex issue. Chapter three, Audiomagnetotelluric method (AMT), presents further insights of the AMT frequency domain method. Firstly, theoretical basics of the AMT method, investigation depth and magnetotelluric family methods (<b>frequency</b> <b>recording</b> capability) are reviewed. Further on, the determinant mode modelling process is discussed in order to obtain a reasonable approach of three-dimensional media along two-dimensional profiles. This chapter demonstrates in detail Stratagem EH 4 equipment, in particular, source effects, optimal transmitter receiver distance, and signal improvement of controlled electromagnetic source. Part II is composed of three different hydrogeophysical case studies at different scales where AMT plays a key role on the approach to each aquifer system. Chapter four, Tordera deltaic aquifer, Spain, is a hydrogeophysical application carried out on a porous aquifer media extensively affected by seawater intrusion. This chapter presents a multidisciplinary approach to a fluviodeltaic aquifer system. Hydrogeological information, AMT, seismic reflection and velocity tomography models have been evaluated together to provide spatially continuous information about aquifer properties processes and boundaries. Two and three-dimensional inverse models have been obtained and validated with hydrogeological data. In addition, an AMT monitoring experiment has been performed every four months to monitor seasonal seawater changes along the main seawater intrusion path. Chapter five, La Soutte, Vosges, France is based on the AMT study on "La Soutte", natural hydrogeophysical laboratory. In this case, 3 D AMT forward model look into a small scale catchment area, aimed to provide a mesoscale framework for other geophysical applications carried out on the site. Combined use of AMT and DC surface resistivity has been also used to image different resolution and work scale of each method. Chapter six, Spring Valley, Nevada, USA presents the AMT study out on Spring Valley, a 110 km long valley on the Nevada Desert aimed to provide a structural framework for water resources exploration and hydrological modelling.
