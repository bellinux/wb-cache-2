5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single <b>individuals</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often {{work as a}} team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for <b>individuals</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E
500|$|In Palm Beach, {{about fifty}} men shoveled sand off Ocean Boulevard {{and cut down}} damaged palm trees with {{crosscut}} saws. On September19, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith issued a [...] "no work, no food" [...] order, effectively stating that all able-boded men should work toward relief efforts. The Delray Beach City Council issued a similar order. Initially, rebuilding in West Palm Beach was slow. City Manager A. E. Parker issued a public notice that stated [...] "Because of the grave emergency now existing and the great need for shelter, {{it has not been}} deemed wise to insist upon building permits for necessary repairs." [...] Many severely damaged buildings were declared [...] "public menaces" [...] and condemned for demolition, effective on October23. On September20, the West Palm Beach City Commission held a special session that allowed the City Treasurer to authorize an in advance requisition payment of $50,000 to the Red Cross. Also on the agenda was an anti-price gauging measure, which would fine <b>individuals</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $500 and imprison them for a maximum of 30days if they sold items above the pre-September16 price.|$|E
500|$|The pygmy slow loris has a {{head and}} body length (measured {{from the top}} of the head to the base of the tail) of there is no {{significant}} difference in size between the sexes. The length of the skull is less than [...] The tail is short, averaging [...] in length. The bodyweight ranges between , with an average mass of [...] for males and [...] for females. There are, however, large seasonal variations in bodyweight, and <b>individuals</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> [...] have been recorded. The animal tends to have significantly higher bodyweights during the winter months, about 50 percent higher than the lowest values in the summer. The weight gains, achieved largely by increasing food intake, are triggered by changes in the length of the day and night. This seasonal change in bodyweight occurs in both sexes, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females—an adaptation thought to help ensure survival during winter when food resources become scarce. The species has distinctive teeth morphology: its third molar is triangular in outline and only slightly smaller than the first molar; its second molar is the largest. The incisors and canines on its lower jaw are procumbent (tilt forward) and together form a toothcomb that is used in grooming and feeding.|$|E

The type species of Camptosaurus is thought to have been only 6-7.9 meters in length and weighed around 785–874kg. In fact, Paul contends that the Camptosaurus was no more than 5 meters long and weighed no more than 0.5 tonnes.
