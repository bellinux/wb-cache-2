5|$|Pittsburgh {{citizens}} {{helped to}} <b>defuse</b> the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and {{by sending a}} delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering. Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march through the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but nothing else.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise transports the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson (Clayton Rohner) to deal with a hostage negotiation on the planet Mordan IV. Jameson took a drug to reverse his aging, and must <b>defuse</b> the situation with a former adversary.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{media were}} often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for {{emphasizing}} Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior. Other commentators {{even suggested that}} Amin had deliberately cultivated his eccentric reputation in the foreign media as an easily parodied buffoon in order to <b>defuse</b> international concern over his administration of Uganda.|$|E

5|$|To <b>defuse</b> {{tension with}} the Burgundians a second double {{marriage}} was arranged in 1409. Isabeau's daughter Michelle married John the Fearless' son Philip the Good; Isabeau's son, Dauphin Louis, married John's daughter Margaret. Before the wedding, Isabeau negotiated a treaty with John the Fearless {{in which she}} clearly defined family hierarchy and her position {{in relation to the}} throne.|$|E
5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to <b>defuse</b> tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cultural}} disputes {{exist between}} Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia. The two countries {{have a similar}} cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about protecting their national heritage. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to <b>defuse</b> some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.|$|E
5000|$|Narendra chaudhary (nicknamed [...] "Steel Man") (1968 - 12 May 2016), was an Indian army Bomb <b>defusing</b> expert, who had <b>defused</b> {{more than}} over 256 bombs in his career.|$|R
50|$|Bridge led a squad which <b>defused</b> a bomb with {{a delayed}} action fuse in September 1940, {{for which he}} {{received}} the George Medal. In March 1941, he <b>defused</b> 15 bombs, including a bomb which had fallen in the Naval dockyard at HMNB Devonport, for which he received a King's Commendation for Brave Conduct. In October 1941 he was awarded a bar to his George Medal after <b>defusing</b> a bomb in the docks in Falmouth.|$|R
2500|$|... 16 January 1990: an IRA {{bomb was}} <b>defused</b> at the Aldershot Garrison in Aldershot, England. A 1,000 lb bomb {{exploded}} outside Sion Mills RUC station. Several homes were extensively damaged, {{although there were}} no injuries. A second devise was <b>defused</b> nearby.|$|R
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of Mahesh Bhavana (Faasil), a photographer, who {{attempts}} to <b>defuse</b> a conflict between his friend Crispin (Shahir) and a group of youngsters passing through their village, and is knocked to the ground. Defeated in the tussle and unable to fight back, he is embarrassed in front of his neighbours. Mahesh publicly vows that he will not wear his slippers again until he has avenged the humiliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed with {{powerful}} magical symbols to protect it. Before he died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} <b>defuse</b> the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would wipe out the human race.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{attempted}} to <b>defuse</b> the discussion {{when he announced}} on December 15 {{that he would be}} returning for his fourth year with the team. But in late December, Vick wavered on that decision {{when it became clear that}} if he left the team, he would be selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. Heading into the Gator Bowl, his decision was still up in the air.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} some {{controversy}} over blast sites and the sites where bombs were <b>defused,</b> most notably that where Zee News reported a bomb being <b>defused</b> at Central Park, while the Outlook Magazine {{stated that the}} park was a bomb site.|$|R
5000|$|... 16 January 1990: an IRA {{bomb was}} <b>defused</b> at the Aldershot Garrison in Aldershot, England. A 1,000 lb bomb {{exploded}} outside Sion Mills RUC station. Several homes were extensively damaged, {{although there were}} no injuries. A second devise was <b>defused</b> nearby.|$|R
50|$|The pair had <b>defused</b> {{many such}} devices together, {{and had just}} {{successfully}} <b>defused</b> a device in Hornchurch which was threatening an aerodrome and explosives factory when they were called to Dagenham. The bomb there was hanging from its parachute on a warehouse.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{specialist}} units were also raised, including three Australian tunnelling companies. Arriving on the Western Front in May 1916 they undertook mining and counter-mining operations alongside British, Canadian and New Zealand companies, initially operating around Armentieres and at Fromelles. The following year they operated in the Ypres section. In November 1916, the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took {{over from the}} Canadians around Hill 60, subsequently playing {{a key role in}} the Battle of Messines in June 1917. During the German offensive in March 1918 the three companies served as infantry, and later supported the Allied advance being used to <b>defuse</b> booby traps and mines. The Australian Electrical Mining and Mechanical Boring Company supplied electric power to units in the British Second Army area.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to <b>defuse</b> the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{had sent}} telephoned {{warnings}} about 90 {{minutes before the}} bomb detonated. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from the area, but the bomb squad were unable to <b>defuse</b> the bomb in time. More than 200 people were injured {{but there were no}} fatalities despite the strength of the bomb, which has been largely credited to the fast response of emergency services. At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs Germany match was to take place in Manchester the following day.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to <b>defuse</b> the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to <b>defuse</b> the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry angrily refused to accept it. Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to <b>defuse</b> mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E

50|$|On 23 August 1973, a {{bomb was}} found in a carrier bag in the ticket hall. The bomb was <b>defused</b> by the bomb squad. A week later, on 30 August, a member of staff found another bomb left on the overbridge. Again, it was <b>defused</b> without any injury.|$|R
5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} is upset by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective mate and her kin, tries to <b>defuse</b> the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} ships' careers, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the main Italian fleet, where they were frequently occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on Naples. In 1895, Partenope joined a squadron that visited Great Britain, and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in an attempt to <b>defuse</b> tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Euridice took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was a reaction to the Greco-Turkish War that had broken out that year. Between 1906 and 1908, Partenope was converted into a minelayer, and Minerva underwent a similar conversion in 19091910. Two ships, Calatafimi and Euridice, were discarded in early 1907.|$|E
5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to <b>defuse</b> the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, speech and {{language}} intervention {{was investigated in}} order to explore the use and function of <b>defusing</b> practices. <b>Defusing</b> practices {{may be viewed as}} a special form of mitigation. In previous research, including studies on clinical interaction, mitigation has been described mainly as devices used {{in order to reduce the}} unwelcome effects of an utterance, or reduce the discomfort of bad news. <b>Defusing</b> practices, however, appear to serve somewhat different functions, which are examined here. Data comprises video and audio recordings of eight intervention sessions with children with language impairment (LI), and six intervention sessions with adults with aphasia, The analysis revealed the following kinds of <b>defusing</b> practices: circumscriptions/figurative language, diminutive words, words like ‘try’ or ‘test’, placing the problem outside of the patient, collective pronouns, diminishing the speech and language pathologist’s own competence, encouragement, and references to well-known phenomena. If speech and language therapists (SLPs) are made aware of the practice and function of <b>defusing,</b> they may make conscious use of these practices in order to reduce face-threatening situations in interventio...|$|R
