5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

40|$|A {{design for}} a six story office {{building}} is performed. For main structure moment frames with composite beams {{in one direction and}} frames with bracings in other direction are selected. Beside usually quality of steel S 235, with reason of optimization of structure, steel quality S 355 is used. A great deal of atention is focused on the dynamic analisys, which is performed using a simplyfied method with horizontal forces and the modal analisys. Steel structure is designed in acordance with the special rules for steel structures. The atention in the comparative dynamic analisys is focused on the relative horizontal displacements between the floors, which is in our case the key criteria for determining dimension of columns and horizontal bracings. Fire analisys of the structure, using the metod of critical temperature, is prerformed for the expected <b>fire</b> <b>resistants</b> R 60...|$|R
25|$|Copper aesthetically enhances {{interior}} wall systems, ceilings, fixtures, furniture, and hardware by evoking {{an atmosphere of}} warmth, tranquility, and calm. Regarding performance advantages, it is lightweight, <b>fire</b> <b>resistant,</b> durable, workable, and non-organic (it does not off-gas). Typical copper-based interiors include panels, shingles, screens, ornaments, fixtures, and other decorative enhancements.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{designed}} in Gothic revival style and was <b>fire</b> <b>resistant,</b> being constructed of masonry. The third {{story of the}} design was not built to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907 which destroyed {{the rest of the}} timber parliament buildings. Coincidentally, exactly the same thing happened in Ottawa in 1916—with fire doors saving the Library when the Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament burned.|$|E

Used for insulating parts in electrical fixtures, paper laminated products (e.g. Formica), thermally insulation foams. It is a thermosetting plastic, with the familiar trade name Bakelite, {{that can be}} molded by heat and pressure when mixed with a filler-like wood flour or can be cast in its unfilled liquid form or cast as foam (e.g. Oasis). Problems include the probability of moldings naturally being dark colors (red, green, brown), and as thermoset {{it is difficult to}} recycle.|$|E

40|$|Plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposited (PECVD) {{aluminum oxide}} (AlOx) layers were developed using a high-throughput industrial-type inline tool. The layers were investigated {{in order to}} receive high passivation quality and thermal stability. With these layers, serving as passivation of low resistivity p-type silicon surfaces, effective lifetimes of 2. 3 ms (1 ohm·cm float-zone (FZ) silicon) could be achieved. The influence of different thermal treatments was studied, applying annealing in forming gas (FGA) and firing in a range of 350 °C to 900 °C. Different layer properties were investigated; appearance of blistering on the surface by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, electrical properties such as the fixed negative charge density Qf and the interface trap density Dit within the AlOx layer by means of capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. <b>Firing</b> <b>resistant</b> PECVD AlOx layers could be developed that show excellent passivation quality with Qf = - 3. 1 · 1012 cm- 2 and Dit = 4 · 1010 cm- 2 eV- 1. Stack systems with an optional capping layer on top of the AlOx film, consisting of PECVD amorphous hydrogenated silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H), are presented as a solution for industrial screen printed silicon solar cells...|$|R

25|$|This Soviet plug, still {{widely used}} in modern Russia, has pin {{dimensions}} and spacing equal to the Europlug, but lacks the insulation sleeves. Unlike the Europlug, it is rated 6A. It has a round body like the French CEE 7/6 or flat body with a round base like CEE 7/17. The round base has no notches. The pins are parallel and do not converge. The body is made of <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> thermoset plastic. The corresponding 6A socket accepts the Europlug, but not others as the 4.5mm holes {{are too small to}} accept the 4.8mm pins of CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 or CEE 7/7 plugs.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti Empire {{was one of}} {{a series}} of kingdoms along the coast {{including}} Dahomey, Benin, and Oyo. The Ashanti Kingdom had mountains and large agricultural surpluses. The southern part of the Ashanti Kingdom is covered with moist semi-deciduous forest whilst the Guinea savanna covers the northern part of the Ashanti Kingdom. The Guinea Savanna consists of short deciduous and <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> trees. Riparian forests also occur along the Afram River and streams of the savanna zone. Soils in the Ashanti Kingdom are mainly of two types, forest ochrosols in southern the Ashanti Kingdom whilst the savanna ochrosols are confined to northern the Ashanti Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E

50|$|The machine {{used in the}} {{incident}} was a Komatsu D355A bulldozer fitted with makeshift armor plating covering the cabin, engine {{and parts of the}} tracks. In places this armor was over 1 ft thick, consisting of 5000-psi Quikrete concrete mix sandwiched between sheets of tool steel (acquired from an automotive dealer in Denver), to make ad-hoc composite armor. This made the machine impervious to small arms <b>fire</b> and <b>resistant</b> to explosives: indeed three external explosions and more than 200 rounds of ammunition fired at the bulldozer had no effect on it.|$|R

25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E
25|$|At the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, upon {{witnessing}} a crash which left fellow British driver Roger Williamson trapped in his overturned and burning car, Purley abandoned his own race {{and attempted to}} save Williamson, who was participating in only his second Formula One race. Purley later recalled that upon arriving at the scene, he heard Williamson crying for help as the fire began to take hold. Purley's efforts to right the car and extinguish the flames were in vain as he received no help from nearby track marshals or emergency workers, in spite of attempts to encourage them, and other passing drivers, {{to come to his}} aid; Williamson died from asphyxiation. The marshals were not wearing <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> clothing and the passing drivers assumed that Purley was attempting to extinguish his own car, having escaped a fiery crash unharmed.|$|E
25|$|Giant sequoias are in {{many ways}} adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually <b>fire</b> <b>resistant,</b> and their cones will {{normally}} open immediately after a fire. The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle humus in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic wildfire to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.|$|E

30|$|In general, many soil- and ground-dwelling {{arthropods}} survive fire endogenously from dormant soil-stored stages, {{much like}} plants. For example, insects like walking sticks and yucca moths seem to endure seasonal shrubland <b>fires</b> as <b>resistant</b> diapause structures. There is little direct {{evidence for this}} fire survival strategy in other arthropod species; however, based on life histories, {{it is likely that}} it applies to many others. Because endogenous survival (of both plants and animals) is also a useful survival strategy for the summer and fall drought of the mediterranean-type climate, it is perhaps best viewed as an ecosystem adaptation to seasonality rather than a fire-specific response (Keeley et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Pears and peaches {{have been}} limited by the climate for {{commercial}} production in Iowa, but recent breeding programs have alleviated some of those constraints. Cold-tender peach trees show flower damage when winter temperatures are - 20 °F or colder. Similarly, Iowa’s wet and humid spring and summer climate encourages fire blight disease in pear crops. New cultivars have been selected from several institutions that can be grown in Iowa with less fear of orchard devastation from cold injury and disease influence.

25|$|Tourism is a {{major source}} of income for the tribe. In 2008 Pueblo Acoma opened the Sky City Cultural Center and Haak'u Museum {{at the base of the}} mesa, {{replacing}} the original, which was destroyed by fire in 2000. The center and museum seek to sustain and preserve Acoma culture. Films about Acoma history are shown and a café serves traditional foods. The architecture was inspired by pueblo design and indigenous architectural traditions with wide doorways in the middle, which in traditional homes make the bringing of supplies easier, Flecks of mica are in the windowpanes, a mineral which is used to create mesa windows. The complex is also <b>fire</b> <b>resistant,</b> unlike traditional pueblos, and is painted in light pinks and purples to match the landscape surrounding it. Traditional Acoma artwork is exhibited and demonstrated at the Center, including ceramic chimneys crafted on the rooftop. Arts and crafts also bring income into the community.|$|E
25|$|The tube frame design, using {{steel core}} and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E

[...] Roosevelt originally suggested a temporary building {{be placed on the}} Ellipse, but President Wilson disliked the idea of a building on the White House's front lawn. [...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial. [...] Roosevelt wanted them to be ugly wooden buildings, so that people would want to tear them down right away after World War I. [...] However, to make the buildings more <b>fire</b> <b>resistant,</b> concrete and steel materials were recommended. Roosevelt later expressed regret for allowing these building to be constructed, saying in 1941, [...] "I didn't think I would ever be let into the Gates of Heaven, because I had been responsible for desecrating the parks of Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|Increased {{population}} {{and the growth of}} suburban areas near parklands, has {{led to the development of}} what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management, in which the park cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. This approach is common to many other protected areas. As part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more <b>fire</b> <b>resistant.</b> Dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year. Glacier National Park has an average of 14 fires with [...] burnt each year. In 2003, [...] burned in the park after a five-year drought and a summer season of almost no precipitation.

500|$|In 1903, {{with the}} design now confirmed, the MDHB {{requested}} {{that a number of}} builders submit a tender document for the construction of the building to the revised design. Over 30 builders were contacted, with William Brown & Son of Manchester winning the contract to construct the new building. Work began in 1904, with {{the first nine months of}} construction focusing on laying the building's foundations, which were dug to a depth of [...] below ground level. The building's frame was built from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland Stone, a design that meant the building was more <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> than with other structural forms. It was completed in 1907 at a cost of approximately £250,000, although when the cost of furniture, fittings and professional fees was taken into account, the total cost was nearer £350,000. Staff from the MDHB headquarters officially moved into the building on 15 July 1907, with staff from departments located in other areas of the city moving in throughout the rest of the year.|$|E
