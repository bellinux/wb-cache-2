5000|$|In {{response}} to public pressure, the EPA and Nalco released {{the list of}} the six ingredients in Corexit 9500, revealing constituents including sorbitan, butanedioic acid, and <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates.</b> Corexit EC9500A is made mainly of <b>hydrotreated</b> light <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates,</b> propylene glycol and a proprietary organic sulfonate. According to the New York Times, [...] "Nalco had previously declined to identify the third hazardous substance in the 9500 formula, but EPA's website reveals it to be dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, a detergent and common ingredient in laxatives". [...] Environmentalists also pressured NALCO to reveal to the public what concentrations of each chemical are in the product; NALCO considered such information a trade secret, but shared it with the EPA.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, Basrah crude oil, {{atmospheric}} distillate of 305 - 623 K boiling range, vacuum distillate of 623 - 823 K boiling range, and wide <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> of boiling range 305 - 823 K are hydrotreated in trickle bed reactor using Cobalt-Molybdenum alumina as a catalyst. Hydrotreating temperatures are 598 - 648 K, 598 - 673 K, 648 - 673 K and 648 K respectively while LHSV are 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1, 1 hr - 1, 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1 respectively. The operating pressure  and H 2 /Oil ratio for all experiments are kept constant at 3 Mpa and 300 liter/liter.     The {{results show that}} Sulphur and metal content decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing LHSV.      Vacuum residue of boiling range above 823 K is mixed with hydrotreated atmospheric distillate, vacuum distillate and with the <b>hydrotreated</b> wide <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate.</b> The temperature for hydrotreating the mixed sample is 648 K and LHSV is 1 hr - 1. It was found that hydrotreating crude oil is the best choice since it gives the highest removal of sulphur, vanadium and cobalt removal. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, ligroin, and Stoddard Solvent. The chemical composition of a <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content. Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as <b>hydrotreated</b> light <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|R

40|$|<b>Petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> {{are widely}} used as an energy source and the {{extraction}} and disposal of these chemicals are done with little consideration of their effects on aquatic environments. Amphibians are considered excellent ecological indicators but little research has examined effects of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> on aquatic species. I evaluated the lethal and sublethal effects on larval amphibians with exposure to <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> associated with various venues of pollution including hydraulic fracturing. I selected three <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> (kerosene, oil, and unleaded gasoline) that {{are known to have}} negative effects on aquatic organisms and are similar to the common constituents of mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing fluid. I examined effects of acute exposure to the water-soluble fraction of each of three distillates at four concentrations in four species: Anaxyrus americanus, Lithobates sphenocephalus, Hyla chrysoscelis, and Ambystoma maculatum. Specifically, I evaluated survival, level of narcosis, and swim time in response to a stimulus over a 72 -hour period. I identified a significant distillate by time effect on response to stimulus and a distillate by concentration effect in all species except Hyla chrysoscelis. Anaxyrus americanus and Hyla chrysoscelis exhibited a significant three-way interaction among distillate, time, and concentration (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Gasoline revealed the greatest lethal impact and oil caused the lowest levels of narcosis. My results suggest that <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> exposure through open waste ponds or leakage of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> is a concern for amphibians. Improved knowledge of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> and their effects on wildlife are needed to develop policies that balance preservation of the environment with human energy needs...|$|R

40|$|During this {{reporting}} period progress on this made in several areas. The Principal Investigator attended {{a meeting of}} the CARB’s Reactivity Research Advisory Committee in which priorities for this project were discussed. The consensus was that Texanol and <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> that are representative of those used with coatings should be the priorities for study. Data were obtained concerning representative <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> compositions from the study of Censullo et al (2001) and a preliminary reactivity analysis of these data were carried out. Progress was made in preparing the new UCR EPA environmental chamber for experiments for this program, but a number of problems have been encountered and the project is currently behind schedule. Progress up to January 2002 is discussed in detail in the report to the EPA, and progress since then is briefly summarized here.

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{studies have been}} carried out to better understand the effects of additives on viscosity, density and surface tension of intermediate and heavy crude oils. The studies have been conducted for the following oil samples: San Francisco oil from Columbia with specific gravity of 28 o- 29 o API, Duri oil with gravity of 19 o- 21 o API, Jobo oil with gravity of 8 o- 9 o API and San Ardo oil gravity of 11 o- 13 o API. The additive used in all of the experiments is <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate.</b> The experiments consist of using <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> as an additive for different samples of heavy crude oils. The experiments include making a mixture by adding <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> to oil samples and measuring surface tension, viscosity and density of pure oil samples and mixtures at different temperatures. The petroleum distillate/oil ratios are the following ratios: 1 : 100, 2 : 100, 3 : 100, 4 : 100 and 5 : 100. Experimental results showed that use of <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> as an additive increases API gravity and leads to reduction in viscosity and surface tension for all the samples. Results showed for all petroleum distillate/oil ratios viscosity and interfacial tension decreases with temperature. As petroleum distillate/oil ratio increases, oil viscosity and surface tension decrease more significantly at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. After all experiments were completed an analytical correlation was done based on the experiment results to develop ?mixing rules?. Using this correlation viscosity, density and surface tension of different petroleum distillate/oil mixtures were obtained (output). These had properties of pure oil and <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate,</b> mixture ratios and temperatures at which measurement is supposed to be done (output). Using this correlation a good match was achieved. For all of the cases (viscosity, density and surface tension), correlation coefficient (R?) was more than 0. 9 which proved to be optimum for a really good match...|$|R
