5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades. These restrictions {{do not apply to}} recreational activities, where wearing bathing suits is permitted. Women wear a <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E
5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path. In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the head {{wheelchair}} accessible. For example, it is now possible to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular field trips to the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> a wide variety of subjects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Head</b> <b>covering.</b> In most synagogues, it is {{considered}} a sign of respect for male attendees to wear a <b>head</b> <b>covering,</b> either a dress hat or a kippa (skull cap, plural kipot also known by the Yiddish term yarmulke). It is common practice for both Jews and non-Jews who attend a synagogue to wear a <b>head</b> <b>covering.</b> Some Conservative synagogues may also encourage (but rarely require) women to cover their heads. Many Reform and Progressive temples do not require people to cover their heads, although individual worshipers, both men and women, may choose to. Many Orthodox and some conservative men and women wear a <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> throughout their day, even when not attending religious services.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the Government has {{reinforced}} {{the legitimacy of}} the hereditary monarchy and the observance of traditional and Muslim values by asserting a national ideology known as the Melayu Islam Beraja (MIB), or Malay Islamic Monarchy, the genesis of which reportedly dates from the 15th century. MIB principles have been adopted as the basis for government, and all meetings and ceremonies commence with a Muslim prayer. At citizenship ceremonies non-Muslims must wear national dress, which includes Muslim <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> for men and women. There is no legal requirement for women to wear <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> in public, and government officials are portrayed regularly, if infrequently, in the media without <b>head</b> <b>coverings.</b> There is social pressure for women to wear <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> in public.|$|R

The blouse huipil has a length of only about 60 cm and shows modern, European and even Asian influence and is generally worn with a voluminous European style skirt which is also heavily decorated. The <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> is called a “huipil de tapar” (covering huipil) or a bidaniro.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Jewish men, {{married or}} not, must cover their heads. The most common <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> is the kippah (Hebrew: skull cap), known as yarmulke in Yiddish. Orthodox men wear {{something}} {{on their heads}} at almost all times, while non-Orthodox men may cover their heads only when performing some religious act, or when eating. Few cover the entire head. Almost all will bathe with the head uncovered, but sleeping varies by community or family practice. The exact nature of this practice, and how binding it is, {{is a matter of}} dispute among halakhic authorities. Wearing a hat is not required by Jewish law, and those who wear a hat always wear a kippah underneath; however, there are some rabbis, especially in Hasidic Judaism, who require a double <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> - of kippah and hat or tallis - during prayer.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Witness deacons ("{{minister}}ial servants") and elders must be male, {{and only}} a baptized adult male may perform a Jehovah's Witness baptism, funeral, or wedding.

25|$|Along with scriptural arguments, Leila Ahmed {{argues that}} <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> {{should not be}} {{compulsory}} in Islam because the veil predates the revelation of the Qur'an.

2500|$|Many Brethren {{interpret}} this verse {{to mean that}} when a woman speaks in church (i.e. prophesies) she {{is supposed to have}} her head covered. The Brethren have generally taken this even further, however, requiring the wearing of <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> even though they have not generally permitted women to speak. For this reason, some meetings will be characterized by the women wearing <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> ("loaners" [...] in some assemblies are available at the back for women who have come without a <b>covering).</b> <b>Head</b> <b>coverings</b> typically {{take the form of a}} tam, beret or similar hat which can be more aptly described as a [...] "head topping," [...] rather than as <b>covering</b> the <b>head</b> in any real way.|$|R

25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism do not {{generally}} require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings {{similar to those}} worn by men, and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the bimah), not for modesty, but as a feminist gesture of egalitarianism. Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is often no requirement. However, kippot may be provided to anybody who wishes to wear them.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigators}} made {{a number}} of recommendations. Chief among them were a redesign of the air-start unit, to permit the exhaust to be blown upward instead of to the side, and educating flight-deck personnel on ordnance cookoff temperatures and times; implementation of a longer huffer air-supply hose, which delivers the air needed to start aircraft and which had already been accomplished aboard USS Constellation due to concerns about ordnance cookoff from huffer exhaust, was also recommended fleetwide. Many other recommendations were made, including installation of redundant communication and control systems, improved communication between key senior personnel, and a redesign of the <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> worn by flight deck firefighters. Investigators also recommended cross-training shipboard dentists as anesthesiologists; a dentist so trained was assigned to Enterprise, giving the medical department the ability to perform additional emergency surgery during the fire.|$|E

Other business to be brought before the new Supreme Council included the approval of an obligation, written by Brother W.C. Eaton, and the appointment of officers to oversee committees. The group adjourned to observe the dinner hour, reconvening the next day (July 14, 1890.) The men approved the seal and badge of the order, {{as well as the}} official <b>head</b> <b>covering,</b> which was to be a turban. Originally, the color of the turban was limited by the Supreme Council, {{but by the end of}} 1890, a local Grotto could choose any color for their turbans as long as the entire Grotto used the same color; all veils were required to be silver. Veils of purple were reserved for members of the Supreme Council.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} strong {{religious}} custom for Jewish males to cover their heads, {{from the standpoint of}} Jewish law there is no special religious significance to the shtreimel as compared to other <b>head</b> <b>coverings.</b> However, the wearing of two <b>head</b> <b>coverings</b> is considered to add additional spiritual merit, plus the presence of beautiful craftsmanship adds beautification and honor to the custom. The shtreimel is always worn over a kippah, or yarmulke.|$|R

500|$|In 1871, the congregation, whose {{membership}} by {{this time}} had reached 100, elected Max Samfield to succeed Tuska. The son of a rabbi, {{he was born in}} 1846 in Marktsteft, Bavaria, and was ordained in Germany. He left for the United States in 1867 to be rabbi of B'nai Zion Congregation of Shreveport, Louisiana, where he served for four years. He had significant competition for the role at B'nai Israel, with at least ten rabbis applying. Samfield had, however, preached there the Sabbath before the election for rabbi, and was hired for a one-year term. A strong proponent of Reform Judaism, he was associated with Wise in founding the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism), and under his leadership, B'nai Israel became one of its founding members in 1873. He was also president of the Board of Governors of Hebrew Union College (HUC) in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was supervisor of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. In 1875, he asked the congregation if he could abandon wearing the traditional <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> while leading the prayers; in response, the members resolved that all men would be required to remove their hats during services. He led the congregation to adopt the Reform movement's new Union Prayer Book in 1896, but resisted moving Sabbath services to Sunday. Like most Reform rabbis at that time, he was strongly anti-Zionist, writing that Zionism was [...] "an abnormal eruption of perverted sentiment".|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head6 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument17) {{is one of}} the smaller {{examples}} of colossal heads, standing [...] It measures [...] wide by [...] deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like <b>head</b> <b>covering</b> joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger {{at the front of the}} ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.|$|E
