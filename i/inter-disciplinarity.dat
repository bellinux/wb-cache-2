40|$|Amidst {{calls for}} a ‘step change’ {{in the quality of}} social work and social care {{research}} come contrasting claims for <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> {{on the one hand and}} disciplinarity on the other. Drawing on the findings of a UK-based consultation, this paper situates the challenges of research capacity development in contexts of wider preoccupations with research impact and <b>inter-disciplinarity,</b> and the problematic distinction between social work as a research discipline and social care as a discipline-transgressing research field. Arguing that both disciplinarity and <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> are best examined as epistemic and social phenomena, both are considered in terms of claims to knowledge, developmental trajectories, forms of social organisation and cultural practice, and contributions to contemporary knowledge markets. This analytic framework is used to scrutinise the diverse understandings of disciplinarity and <b>inter-disciplinarity,</b> along with their opportunities and threats, brought by UK social work academics and cognate discipline representatives to the challenges of research capacity development. Contrasts and commonalities with wider contexts are highlighted. The argument concludes that disciplinarity and <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> are co-dependent. Strategies for building social work and social care research excellence and impact will best succeed if they pay heed both to distinctive disciplinary needs and to enhancing cross-fertilisation, integration and collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{extensive}} literature reviews focusing, in particular, on user (and audience) {{research in}} the fields of library and information science and communication studies, the author describes the increasing chaos of human studies and user studies [...] the plethora of theories, concepts, approaches, methods, and findings which plague researchers within and between fields and bewilder policy maker and practitioner observers. The origins and symptoms of these disciplinary overloads and the usual forms of <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> brought to bear on them are traced and the author argues that most usual approaches to <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> act as more of the same and contribute to overload conditions. She calls for a methodological approach to <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> based on fundamental communicative principles. For library and information science, which as a field has traditionally drawn on multi-disciplinary sources, the author cautions that as the field sets itself to the task of assisting the inter-disciplinary needs of its constituencies, it is especially important that the field also attend to inter-disciplinary needs within its own walls, between its many disparate and disconnected discourse communities...|$|E

Often responding to government agendas, {{it is not}} uncommon for university research strategies to include <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> by default, by supporting multidisciplinary collaborations across the institution, nationally and internationally – industry and business being a particular focus. Beginning from the premise that Inter-disciplinary is where students/staff from more than one discipline learn with, from and about one another through a common activity, usually in the context of practice, this report documents the findings of a recent research project aimed to document ways in which inter-disciplinary approaches were active in universities, how they were resourced, what made them effective, and in what ways they are limited...|$|E

40|$|Aalborg University applies a problem-based {{learning}} model. Each semester {{all students}} form groups. Group members formulate and agree upon a problem {{they want to}} address, within their course of study, and write a long report on their findings (length depends on the year of study, the number of group members etc.). Key principles for the choice problem is praxis-orientation, <b>inter-disciplinarity,</b> and contextualisation. 1 To facilitate <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> two supervisors – a disciplinary and a contextual – might be associated with student groups. We are a team of seven undergraduate students of Chemistry, Environmental technology and Biotechnology study-programme at Aalborg University, and our contextual supervisor. In our second semester (February-May 2008) {{we were working on}} the problem “What is the risk of methane migration into houses situated on the terminated landfill “Skrænten ” in Hjørring, Denmark? ” Our work with the problem consisted of both a technical part and a contextual part. In the technical part we investigated the theoretical foundation of methane production in landfills and we measured the concentration of methane at different places at the landfill Skrænten in Hjørring.

40|$|International audienceEngaging a {{discussion}} between literature and case studies, this article aims {{to wonder how}} sociology can take ownership of environmental issues, while social demands for expertise, formulation of standards and <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> have never been stronger. Such expectations are even more specific {{in the context of}} environmental controversies. Sociology takes part in the constitution of the field of “environmental sciences” and is therefore, anchored between the two postures of expertise and commitment. The professional experiences of the two authors {{are at the heart of}} this reflection. Both in the teaching of sociology and in the participation in research projects, involving other scientific disciplines, knowledge production and sharing can be limited by the partial impossibility to lead a scientific protocol. Is it necessary to give up for all that the idea of <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> between various scientific fields? Is it necessary to put aside the implication of the sociologist in concrete projects, based on an expertise founded on a fundamental research? In the third part of this article, the posture of the committed sociologist - scholarship with commitment (Bourdieu, 2002) – will be revisited not only from the analysis of several situations of research, but also from various experiences in professional structures, in which the sociologist was invited to propose measures serving as basis for action...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} of change within higher education; in the need for research-based responses to the grand challenges facing society; in questions about the disciplinary context in which higher education is being delivered; and in the employability of graduates and post-graduates. Key features of these changes identified by the European University Association (EUA) and the Irish University Association (IUA), include quality research training, <b>inter-disciplinarity,</b> partnerships with industry, and a mentality of innovation. 		 This paper, based on research undertaken both at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), focuses on transforming graduate and post-graduate thinking and learning beyond disciplinary boundaries. The challenge for students is to continuously develop toward a possible and ideal interdisciplinary ways of thinking and practicing (WTPs) researcher self-state. More precisely, the study explored how distinctive learning spaces can be built into graduate and post-graduate teaching-learning environments (TLEs) {{in order to create}} opportunities for transformative learning to occur. The research results identify aspects of the learning space that impact on the students’ ability to overcome the ‘troublesome knowledge’ of disciplinary barriers; of engaging in insider inquiry; and of continuous reflection on evolving multiple self-states as researchers.

40|$|This highly {{speculative}} paper {{seeks to}} discern where {{the discipline of}} Bioethics may be heading {{in the next decade}} or two. It is clear that the rapid pace of scientific discovery and technological innovation will not slacken, and, as a result, fresh moral issues, for which there are no precedents in currently accepted moral wisdom, will rapidly emerge. This mushrooming of ethical problems will be taking place at a time of increasing moral pluralism, when common moral values become harder to establish, and powerful subgroups embrace moral dogmatism, whether religious or secular in character. Faced with such complexity and confusion, governments and industrial groups will increasingly seek guidance from bioethics "experts", through paid consultancies, advisory panels and commissioned reports on specific topics. But Bioethics itself is currently in a stage of flux: 1. Certain research areas in Bioethics have 'bolted' (in the horticultural sense), because of a rich injection of funds - notably genetics and stem cell research - while other areas are relatively under-researched. 2. <b>Inter-disciplinarity</b> has become de rigueur, largely under funder pressure, and, allied to this, an insistence on empirical work has created conceptual confusions. 3. There is a continuing ferment in bioethical theory, with little sign of productive co-operation between rival camps. Indeed theoretical enrichment seems to lag far behind the constant demand for relevance and 'applied ethics'. So what of the future? I detect certain trends, some to be deplored and discouraged, others to be applauded and nurtured. On my 'black list' are: the commercialisation of Bioethics; and the dumbing down of several critical disciplines in the name of relevance. On my 'white list' are: further adventures in theory; <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> come of age; and the future envisioned in today's young minds...|$|E
40|$|As often {{occurs with}} the {{development}} of new technologies, innovative concepts of novel human experiences are mainly derived from the demonstration of ‘‘technological potentials’’. Nowadays, advanced communication applications such as tele-presence, 3 D holographic experiments, immersive VR environments, large highresolution imaging displays, have all demonstrated a potential to support experiences of ‘‘presence’’. However, the application of scientific insights from basic research on human perception and cognition has not yet influenced the design of advanced software systems and presence technologies. The lack of <b>inter-disciplinarity</b> has often brought well-known failures of overengineered technologies which almost ignored basic understanding of how human perception, cognition, co-operation and communication work.

This article extends international business studies (IB) accounts of the Janus face of globalisation through a user-perception analysis of higher education services in the world’s most significant per-capita education exporter nation.
