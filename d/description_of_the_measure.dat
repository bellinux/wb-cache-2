40|$|Measuring graph {{similarity}} is a {{key issue}} in many applications. We propose a new constraint-based modeling language for defining graph similarity measures by means of constraints. It covers measures based on univalent matchings, such that each node is matched with at most one node, as well as multivalent matchings, such that a node may be matched {{with a set of}} nodes. This language is designed on top of Comet, a programming language supporting both Constraint Programming (CP) and Constraint-Based Local Search (CBLS). Starting from the constraint-based <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure,</b> we automatically generate a Comet program for computing the measure. Depending on the measure characteristics, this program either uses CP -which is better suited for computing exact measures such as (sub) graph isomorphism- or CBLS -which is better suited for computing error-tolerant measures such as graph edit distances. First experimental results show the feasibility of our approach. Anglai...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a process of}} two classes of particles jumping on a one-dimensional lattice. The marginal system of the first class of particles is the one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. When classes are disregarded the process is also the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. The existence of a unique invariant measure with product marginals with density p and 2 for the first- and first- plus second-class particles, respectively, was shown by Ferrari, Kipnis, and Saada. Recently Derrida, Janowsky, Lebowitz, and Speer have computed this invariant measure for finite boxes and performed the infinitevolume limit. Based on this computation we give a complete <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> and derive some of its properties.

40|$|The {{national}} {{approach to}} public {{funding of the}} film industry has been subject to a shift in recent years, at an international level, moving from a grant and subsidy scheme towards more automatic form of supports, including tax incentives. The paper aims at analysing {{the impact of the}} new tax credit measures for the Italian film industry, introduced in 2008, {{within the framework of the}} 2007 financial law, and in force since the third quarter of 2009. The impact is evaluated on both the domestic film production companies and on the State accounts level. The measure of tax credit for film with cultural requirements provides the film production company with the possibility of offsetting its tax debt (national and regional income tax, VAT, social contribution and costs) during the production, within a cap of 15 % of total eligible costs. Starting from the data collected and processed by the Ministry of Culture since the beginning of the implementation phase, the paper aims at demonstrating the positive balance for the State determined by the increase of private investments on film with cultural requirements and, consequently, of the induced direct and indirect tax return. A brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> will be followed by a comparison of the incremental value produced by the film sector throughout the year following the enforcement of the tax credit measures...|$|E
40|$|Galaxy surveys aim {{to map the}} {{large-scale}} structure of the Universe and use redshift space distortions to constrain deviations from general relativity and probe the existence of massive neutrinos. However, {{the amount of information}} that can be extracted is limited by the accuracy of theoretical models used to analyze the data. Here, by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model run over the MXXL N-body simulation, we assess the impact of galaxy formation on satellite kinematics and the theoretical modelling of redshift-space distortions. We show that different galaxy selection criteria lead to noticeable differences in the radial distributions and velocity structure of satellite galaxies. Specifically, whereas samples of stellar mass selected galaxies feature satellites that roughly follow the dark matter, emission line satellite galaxies are located preferentially in the outskirts of halos and display net infall velocities. We demonstrate that capturing these differences is crucial for modelling the multipoles of the correlation function in redshift space, even on large scales. In particular, we show how modelling small scale velocities with a single Gaussian distribution leads to a poor <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> clustering. In contrast, we propose a parametrization that is flexible enough to model the satellite kinematics, and that leads to and accurate description of the correlation function down to sub-Mpc scales. We anticipate that our model will be a necessary ingredient in improved theoretical descriptions of redshift space distortions, which together could result in significantly tighter cosmological constraints and a more optimal exploitation of future large datasets.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{health-related}} QOL (HR-QOL) measures {{specifically designed for}} people with diabetes mellitus {{have appeared in the}} literature. This article provides a selective review of 12 measures that address this important construct. For each included study, a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> and its development phase is provided, followed by discussion of sampling, reliability, validity and appropriateness for selected populations. Measures designed to investigate broad and specific conceptualisations of diabetes-specific QOL are included. For research in which a broad conceptualisation of diabetes-specific QOL is appropriate, the following measures are recommended: Diabetes- 39, Diabetes Care Profile (DCP), Diabetes Impact Management Scales (DIMS), Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) and the Diabetes-Specific Quality of Life Scale (DSQOLS). For investigation of one or more specific aspects of diabetes-specific QOL, other measures may also be appropriate: single-scale questionnaires such as the Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS) [stressful impact], Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) [life without diabetes] and the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale (PAID) [diabetes-related distress]; the Diabetes Health Profile (DHP) which focuses on diabetes-related distress, activity and eating behaviour; the Questionnaire on Stress in Patients with Diabetes-Revised (QSD-R) which has a primary focus on diabetes-related distress; and the Well-Being Enquiry for Diabetics (WED) which is primarily concerned with the perceptions of patients with diabetes in relation to mental health. Researchers selecting a diabetes-specific QOL measure should also carefully consider the conceptual underpinnings of the available instruments, as there is little uniformity in the definition and conceptualisation of HR-QOL. Based upon participants involved in questionnaire development and validation studies, those questionnaires that appear to be most appropriate for use with a variety of patient populations include the Diabetes- 39, DIMS, Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire - Revised (DQLCTQ-R), PAID and the QSD-R. The DCP and DHP appear to be especially relevant measures of HR-QOL for patients with type 2 diabetes, while the DQOL, DSQOLS and WED have clear emphases on concerns of individuals with type 1 diabetes. The length of the DQLCTQ-R may raise concerns about its use among some populations (e. g. older adults). Recommendations for future research include: (i) increasing the diversity of samples used to develop and evaluate existing and new measures in terms of race/ethnicity, age and gender; (ii) examination of the causal relationship between diabetes self-management and QOL using longitudinal designs; (iii) increasing emphasis on the positive aspects of successful chronic illness self-management; and (iv) use of HR-QOL measures to inform empowering relationships between physicians and patients.

40|$|The use {{of common}} {{measures}} {{can greatly facilitate}} data sharing and data interoperability. For genome wide association studies (GWAS), meta-analyses that combine or compare studies is a widely accepted approach. Combining studies can increase the population size and the statistical power of the analysis. Increased statistical power is particularly relevant {{to the discovery of}} moderate associations and complex associations, such as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Comparing study results from different populations is considered essential to the validation of preliminary findings. The PhenX Toolkit provides the scientific community with high priority, recommended measures for use in GWAS and other large-scale studies. The Toolkit is intended to help researchers expand studies to include (common) measures that are outside of their primary research focus. The PhenX Toolkit currently contains over 200 measures (17 research domains) and will include measures for 21 research domains by the end of 2010. The Toolkit provides users with a web-based interface for searching, browsing, and selecting PhenX measures and protocols. For each PhenX Measure, the Toolkit provides a brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure,</b> the rationale for selecting the measure, protocol(s) for collecting the measure, and supporting documentation. Measures are associated with a research domain, and may also be included in “Collections” (such as “Top 20 Measures”) and “Conceptual Groups” (such as “Lifestage”) that comprise measures that cut across the research domains. The “Smart Query Tool” offers two options: a high-specificity search through measure and protocol names, synonyms, and keywords; and a high sensitivity full-text search. The “Data Collection Worksheet” enables Toolkit users to easily integrate PhenX measures into their studies and the Data Dictionary provides variable names, identifiers, and attributes in several formats. All PhenX measures have Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid Common Data Elements (caBIG CDEs) and are accessible using the caBIG CDE browser. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) codes are also being developed for PhenX measures and some have been released with “Trial” status. PhenX measures, protocols and/or variables have been mapped to studies in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), the Public Population Project in Genomics’s (P 3 G) Data Schema and Harmonization Platform for Epidemiological Research (DataSHaPER), and to primary phenotype variables collected by the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) research consortium. The goal is to enable identification of PhenX variables in electroninc medical records (EMRs), clinical data repositories and other resources, promoting data sharing and cross-study analysis. A cross-reference guide linking PhenX measures, protocols and variables to standards and other identifiers is in development. The PhenX Toolkit provides the research community with freely available, well-established measures and bioinformatics tools that promote data sharing and data interoperability...|$|E
