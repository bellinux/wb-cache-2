5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> between these two groups.|$|E
5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars argue that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E

25|$|Other {{aspects to}} be {{considered}} with this idea are the adverse effects on aquatic life of the San Juan River, lakes Managua and Colcibolca, the existing flora and fauna {{in the area that}} would be flooded by a proposed dam in the plan, and the environmental impact of the dam construction {{and all of the other}} related works.

25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves and do whatever it is they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{a review}} of the case, the Court of Appeal will make a {{determination}} on the question and may then alter the sentence passed, pass a sentence, or give such judgment or make such order as it deems fit.

25|$|Almost all {{hearings}} in the Inner House are before three judges, although in important {{cases in which}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> of authority a court of five judges or, exceptionally, seven, may be convened. The Inner House is sub-divided into two divisions of equal authority and jurisdiction - the First Division, headed by the Lord President; and the Second Division headed by the Lord Justice Clerk. The courts to hear each case are, ordinarily, drawn from these divisions. When neither is available to chair a hearing, an Extra Division of three Senators is summoned, chaired by the most senior judge present; due to pressure of business this Extra Division sits frequently nowadays.|$|E
25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E
25|$|Giant, segmented, insect-like, {{antennae}} {{rise over}} a distant mountain range. There is no direct {{connection between the}} antennae and the aliens, but the newly discovered race is named Ark Megaforms. The demonstration of the antennae {{appears to be an}} act of intimidation. It soon becomes apparent that Ark Megaforms want the humans to leave the planet as soon as possible. The Megaforms use the Kid as their negotiator with the humans. The Kid visits the base of ER-2 several times. He allows the humans to study him and question him about his foster parents in exchange for the promise to leave. The communication does not proceed smoothly as the Kid exhibits the mixture of human and alien psychological traits. His very way of thought seems inconceivable to humans. Though he can speak, most of the questions he is either unable or unwilling to answer. Moreover, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> of interest as the humans want to find out about Ark Megaforms as much as possible while the Kid just wants them to leave.|$|E
