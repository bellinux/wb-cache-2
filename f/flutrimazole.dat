40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Flutrimazole</b> {{is a wide}} {{spectrum}} antifungal drug. It {{is used for the}} topical treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin. Conventional topical products typically provide active ingredients in relatively high concentrations but with a short duration of action. Microsponge Systems are designed to allow a sustained rate of release of the active ingredients, offering a potential reduction in side effects while maintaining their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to produce microsponges containing <b>flutrimazole</b> which were able to control the release of drug to the skin. Compatibility of drug with formulation components were established by Differential Scanning Colorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR). Microsponges were prepared by using previously optimized emulsion solvent diffusion method. Shape and surface morphology were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Drug content, particle size analysis and loading yield were determined in the prepared microparticles. The micrograph revealed microporous nature of microsponges. It was shown that the drug: polymer ratio, stirring rate, volume of dispersed phase influenced the particle size and drug release behavior of the formed microsponges. <b>Flutrimazole</b> microparticles were then incorporated into standard vehicles for release studies. Kinetics of drug release from microsponge itself followed Higuchi matrix model. Drug release was observed controlled as compared with the cream containing free drug. INTRODUCTION: Numerou...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} (up to 1994) on contact sensitivity to imidazoles and {{presents the results}} obtained from 15 patients observed at the Contact Allergy Unit in Leuven. The frequency {{as well as the}} cross-reaction patterns described are analyzed. Although allergic contact reactions may have been missed in the past (mainly because of problems with the correct choice of vehicle for patch testing), they seem to be relatively infrequent in view of their widespread use. The imidazole derivatives most frequently reported to be allergens are miconazole, econazole, tioconazole, and isoconazole. As far as cross-reactivity is concerned, statistically significant associations were found in the patient data between miconazole, econazole, and isoconazole; between sulconazole, miconazole, and econazole; and also between isoconazole and tioconazole. Patients sensitive to phenylethyl imidazoles (except ketoconazole) needing antimycotic therapy should be advised to use ketoconazole, clotrimazole, bifonazole, or, perhaps, the new <b>flutrimazole.</b> Clearly, non-imidazole antifungals can also be used. status: publishe...|$|E
