25|$|During {{a survey}} in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, 32 {{species of plants}} were {{identified}} as food for gaur. They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of <b>elephant</b> <b>apple</b> (Dillenia ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and monsoon, they feed on preferably fine and fresh grasses and herb species of the legume family, such as tick clover (Desmodium triflorum), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as karvy (Strobilanthes callosus), Indian boxwood (Gardenia latifolia), mallow-leaved crossberry (Grewia abutifolia), East-Indian screw tree (Helicteres ssp.) and the chaste tree (Vitex negundo). In summer, they also feed on bark of teak (Tectona grandis), on fruit of golden shower tree (Cassia fistula), and on the bark and fruit of cashew (Anacardium occidentale). Gaur {{spent most of their}} daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30am and between 5:30 and 6:45pm. During the hottest hours of the day, 1:30 to 3:30pm, they rest in the shade of big trees.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on the role of}} fruits on public health. Amount of nutrition value on different fruits of Bangladesh also examined. Fruits are not only good source of vitamins and minerals but also highly nutritive with anti carcinogenic value. The role of sufficient intake of fruits can prevent many life threatening diseases of human beings like diabetics, blood pressure, heart diseases and cancer. Altogether 39 fruits, the highest water portion 96. 6 g was found in black berry and Jamun, and the lowest 4. 3 g were found in coconut. The highest total minerals 1. 7 g was measured in date palm and the lowest 0. 1 g was found in orange, black berry and Jamun. The maximum fiber 6. 6 mg was found in coconut and the lowest 0. 2 g was found in jackfruit and water melon. The highest Calorie 662 Kcal was found in coconut and the lowest 11 Kcal was measured in black berry and Jamun.

60|$|There {{were only}} two kinds of show known by that name in the Boy's Town: a Nigger Show, or a {{performance}} of burnt-cork minstrels; and an Animal Show, or a strolling menagerie; and the boys always meant a menagerie when they spoke of a show, unless they said just what sort of show. The only perfect joy on earth {{in the way of}} an entertainment, of course, was a circus, but after the circus the show came unquestionably next. It made a processional entry into the town almost as impressive as the circus's, and the boys went out to meet it beyond the corporation line in the same way. It always had two elephants, at least, and four or five camels, and sometimes there was a giraffe. These headed the procession, the elephants in the very front, with their keepers at their heads, and then the camels led by halters dangling from their sneering lips and contemptuous noses. After these began to come the show-wagons, with pictures on their sides, very flattered portraits of the wild beasts and birds inside; lions first, then tigers (never meaner than Royal Bengal ones, which the boys understood to be a superior breed), then leopards, then pumas and panthers; then bears, then jackals and hyenas; then bears and wolves; then kangaroos, musk-oxen, deer, and such harmless cattle; and then ostriches, emus, lyre-birds, birds-of-Paradise and all the rest.

60|$|Thus far {{not very}} many pennies had been given him, and, used at last to his strange looks, the less polite {{passengers}} of those {{in that part of}} the boat began to get their fill of him as a curious object; when suddenly the negro more than revived their first interest by an expedient which, whether by chance or design, was a singular temptation at once to diversion and charity, though, even more than his crippled limbs, it put him on a canine footing. In short, as in appearance he seemed a dog, so now, in a merry way, like a dog he began to be treated. Still shuffling among the crowd, now and then he would pause, throwing back his head and, opening his mouth like an <b>elephant</b> for tossed <b>apples</b> at a menagerie; when, making a space before him, people would have a bout at a strange sort of pitch-penny game, the cripple's mouth being at once target and purse, and he hailing each expertly-caught copper with a cracked bravura from his tambourine. To be the subject of alms-giving is trying, and to feel in duty bound to appear cheerfully grateful under the trial, must be still more so; but whatever his secret emotions, he swallowed them, while still retaining each copper this side the oesophagus. And nearly always he grinned, and only once or twice did he wince, which was when certain coins, tossed by more playful almoners, came inconveniently nigh to his teeth, an accident whose unwelcomeness was not unedged by the circumstance that the pennies thus thrown proved buttons.|$|R

In Assam, traditionally the unripe fruits are used to make curries because of its sour taste and ripe fruits are making pickles. The fruits are generally high in fibre and due to presence of gummy substances, extraction of juice becomes difficult. The plant grows about 15 m tall. Not only the fruits have medicinal values but the leaves and the bark also showed numerous pharmacological activity. The studies showed that the plant possesses various activities like Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, dysentery, Antidiabetic etc. The fruits and the juice of the plant are traditionally used for the treatment of various diseases and one of the major diseases is Diabetes Mellitus.

The longest preservation time was observed in fruits preserved in FT (- 1 °C) and shortest in fruits preserved in ES (35 °C) whilst the maturity index was highest in ES (35 °C) treatments and lowest in FT (- 1 °C) compared to the other treatments {{at the end of the}} experiments. However, fruits kept at FT (- 1 °C) exhibited chilling injury symptoms. Total Soluble Solids (TSS) was highest in ES (35 °C) and PCET (28 °C) from the 1 st to the 7 th harvest compared to other treatments. A similar increasing trend in TSS was observed in all the treatments. On the contrary, Titratable Acidity (TA) was highest in FT (- 1 °C) and LT (12 °C) from the 1 st till the 7 th harvest. Similarly a declining trend of TA was found in all the other treatments. TSS was found to be higher in pulp than in peel in the ethanol treatment at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h.
