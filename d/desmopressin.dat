5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug <b>desmopressin,</b> which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, <b>desmopressin</b> (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by <b>desmopressin</b> (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} between the main forms, <b>desmopressin</b> stimulation is also used; <b>desmopressin</b> can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking <b>desmopressin,</b> a patient should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as {{this can lead to}} sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If <b>desmopressin</b> reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (<b>desmopressin).</b> If the DI is due to renal pathology, <b>desmopressin</b> does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).|$|E
25|$|DDAVP (<b>desmopressin)</b> tablets are a {{synthetic}} replacement for antidiuretic hormone, the hormone that reduces urine production during sleep. <b>Desmopressin</b> is usually {{used in the}} form of <b>desmopressin</b> acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP are 4.5 times more likely to stay dry than those taking a placebo. The drug replaces the hormone for that night with no cumulative effect. US drug regulators have banned using <b>desmopressin</b> nasal sprays for treating bedwetting since the oral form is considered safer.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} gestational DI {{can be treated}} with <b>desmopressin</b> (ddAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an {{abnormality}} in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and <b>desmopressin</b> should not be used.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with vWD type 1 and vWD type 2A, <b>desmopressin</b> is available as different preparations, recommended {{for use in}} cases of minor trauma, or in preparation for dental or minor surgical procedures. <b>Desmopressin</b> stimulates the release of vWF from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of vWF (as well as coagulant factor VIII) three- to five-fold. <b>Desmopressin</b> is also available as a preparation for intranasal administration (Stimate) and as a preparation for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> is {{contraindicated}} in vWD type 2b {{because of}} the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications. <b>Desmopressin</b> is probably not effective in vWD type 2M and is rarely effective in vWD type 2N. It is totally ineffective in vWD type 3.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> is used {{to improve}} {{platelet}} function by activating arginine vasopressin receptor 1A.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin {{agonists}} {{are used}} therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue <b>desmopressin</b> {{is used in}} conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, {{as well as for}} control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.|$|E
25|$|DDAVP is most {{efficient}} {{in children with}} nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal urine production greater than 130% of expected bladder capacity for age) and normal bladder reservoir function (maximum voided volume greater than 70% of expected bladder capacity for age). Other children who are likely candidates for <b>desmopressin</b> treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use <b>desmopressin,</b> a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E
500|$|Bladder: Symptomatology of the {{urinary tract}} {{is common in}} MS. Treatments for bladder {{problems}} {{vary depending on the}} origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are <b>desmopressin</b> for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non-pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; [...] and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder.|$|E
2500|$|Central DI and gestational DI {{respond to}} <b>desmopressin</b> which is given as {{intranasal}} or oral tablets. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive medication, {{has also had}} some success {{in this type of}} DI. Also, gestational DI tends to abate on its own four to six weeks following labor, though some women may develop it again in subsequent pregnancies. [...] In dipsogenic DI, <b>desmopressin</b> is not usually an option.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> is a {{synthetic}} analog {{of the natural}} antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. [...] Its overuse can lead to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia with consequent convulsion.|$|E
2500|$|A fluid {{deprivation}} test {{is another}} way of distinguishing DI from other causes of excessive urination. If there is no change in fluid loss, giving <b>desmopressin</b> can determine if DI is caused by: ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{diabetes}} insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, {{it can also}} rarely occur {{not only in the}} absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). [...] "Adipsic {{diabetes insipidus}}" [...] is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the patient may also fail to respond to <b>desmopressin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{ristocetin}} cofactor {{activity is}} low when the patient's platelet-poor plasma is assayed against formalin-fixed, normal donor platelets. [...] However, when the assay is {{performed with the}} patient's own platelets (platelet-rich plasma), a lower-than-normal amount of ristocetin causes aggregation to occur. [...] This {{is due to the}} large vWF multimers remaining bound to the patient's platelets. Patients with this subtype are unable to use <b>desmopressin</b> as a treatment for bleeding, because it can lead to unwanted platelet aggregation and aggravation of thrombocytopenia.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{involves}} drinking sufficient fluids {{to prevent}} dehydration. Other treatments {{depend on the}} type. In central and gestational disease treated is with <b>desmopressin.</b> Nephrogenic disease may be treated by addressing the underlying cause {{or the use of}} a thiazide, aspirin, or ibuprofen. The number of new cases of diabetes insipidus each year is 3 in 100,000. Central DI usually starts between the ages of 10 and 20 and occurs in males and females equally. Nephrogenic DI can begin at any age. The term [...] "diabetes" [...] is derived from the Greek word meaning siphon.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E

50|$|Nighttime {{incontinence}} may {{be treated}} by increasing ADH levels. The hormone can be boosted by a synthetic version known as <b>desmopressin,</b> or DDAVP, which recently became available in pill form. Patients can also spray a mist containing <b>desmopressin</b> into their nostrils. <b>Desmopressin</b> is approved for use by children. There is difficulty in keeping the bed dry after medication is stopped, with as high as an 80% relapse rate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> is used {{to treat}} nocturnal {{enuresis}} (bedwetting). It is usually prescribed {{in the form of}} <b>desmopressin</b> acetate, by mouth. Children taking DDAVP have 2.2 fewer wet nights per week and are 4.5 times more likely to sleep without disruption compared with placebo.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{must stop}} taking <b>desmopressin</b> if they develop severe {{vomiting}} and diarrhea, fever, the flu, or severe cold. Patients {{should also be}} very cautious about taking <b>desmopressin</b> during hot weather conditions or following strenuous exercise, as these conditions can place stress on the body's electrolyte and water balance.|$|E
50|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>desmopressin</b> in hemophilia A depends predominantly {{on whether the}} deficiency involved is qualitative (i.e., there is a functional mutation of the protein itself) or quantitative (i.e., there is decreased production of a functionally normal protein). <b>Desmopressin</b> is most effective in patients with quantitative deficiencies, because by increasing the release of vWF, the circulating pool of functional factor VIII effectively increases, as well. In patients who have functional defects in factor VIII, the use of <b>desmopressin</b> is moot, because it will only increase the circulating levels of a nonfunctional protein.|$|E

50|$|<b>Desmopressin</b> is {{degraded}} {{more slowly}} than recombinant vasopressin, and requires less frequent administration. In addition, it has little effect on blood pressure, while vasopressin may cause arterial hypertension. Vasopressin stimulates the release of ACTH, which indirectly increases responsiveness of alpha-1 receptor in blood vessel smooth muscle, increasing vessel tone and blood pressure. Several studies has shown that <b>Desmopressin</b> does not stimulate ACTH release (except in Cushing's Disease), and therefore does not directly raise blood pressure, however, one study showed that it stimulates ACTH release in over 50% of healthy subjects. Additionally, <b>desmopressin</b> is able to enhance ACTH and cortisol release in normal subjects following oCRH administration, but not in patients with anorexia nervosa.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{management}} of symptoms is possible also, although by necessity temporary, as definitive surgical management {{is required to}} bring levels of von Willebrand factor back to normal. In severe bleeding, blood transfusions and IV fluid infusions {{can be used to}} maintain blood pressure. In addition, <b>desmopressin</b> (DDAVP) is known to be effective in people with von Willebrand's disease, including people with valvular heart disease. <b>Desmopressin</b> stimulates release of von Willebrand factor from blood vessel endothelial cells by acting on the V2 receptor, which leads to decreased breakdown of Factor VIII. <b>Desmopressin</b> is thus sometimes used directly to treat mild to moderate acquired von Willebrand's disease and is an effective prophylactic agent for the reduction of bleeding during heart valve replacement surgery.|$|E
