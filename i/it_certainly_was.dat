500|$|Still, {{he finds}} much to {{appreciate}} {{in the history}} plays: here, it is the weak, vacillating, sometimes contemptible character of King John; the [...] "comic" [...] but forthright, noble character of Philip the Bastard; the desperation and excess of maternal tenderness in Constance; and many beautiful and affecting passages. Hazlitt also offers some reflections on Shakespeare's versification. There was some controversy over whether this play was genuinely Shakespeare's. He concludes that the verse shows that <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was,</b> a judgement borne out by later critics.|$|E

Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure, Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević, Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher. The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a pretty big deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, so we were really thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E

Young reformers gleefully left town, while older members grumbled. “There’s too much work piling up,” snarled one. “Now we’ll be here till Christmas!” Come September, the reviews were mixed. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> “no vacation,” insisted George Aiken of Vermont, who discovered that his Senate work followed him home.

2500|$|One {{newspaper}} noted: [...] "Michigan, {{with the}} exception of one or two double passes, relied almost altogether on straight football, line bucking and runs around the end. Chicago, on the contrary, used trick plays throughout but the team work was of a high order, as shown by both teams." [...] After the game, Michigan's team captain, J.W.F. Bennett, told reporters: [...] "Widman's sensational run was the feature of the game, but every player deserves the victory. [...] We must thank Keene Fitzpatrick for our splendid condition."

[...] I cannot remember a meal that I enjoyed more or that seemed more wildly and agreeably extravagant.

2500|$|In Victoria, Berry, by {{voracious}} reading, {{acquired the}} education {{he had missed}} in England, and taught himself economics, literature and philosophy. But all his life he retained a broad London accent, which many Victorian conservatives found offensive or amusing. In Parliament he once asked the Speaker: [...] "What is now before the 'Ouse?" [...] To which the Leader of the Opposition interjected: [...] "An H!" [...] He developed a powerful rhetorical style modelled on that of his hero Gladstone, equally effective in the rough-house of the colonial Parliament or on the hustings. The conservative newspaper The Argus conceded: [...] "His oratory might not be polished: <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> notbut it was passionate, and it told." [...] Noted for his humour, Berry was nevertheless a tough and determined politician.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the DUP {{politician}} Peter Robinson commented in a Commons Sitting on the Appropriation (Northern Ireland) Order 1984 that: [...] "Until the 1960s {{there was}} a happy use of both Londonderry and Derry.

The Protestants, Unionists and Loyalists who come from that area are happy to call themselves Derrymen. It was a matter that did not provoke excitement and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not taken as being an offensive remark to say that one was from Derry. Then, in the 1960s, as part of a deliberate campaign by Republicans to loosen the London connection, they emphasised that they had dropped the name London from the name of the city. As a result, the Unionist community emphasised the London part of the name." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was further}} {{extended}} by Henry I and Henry II. [...] More improvements and some repairs {{were carried out}} by Henry III, these improvements including a bridge across the River Severn leading to a barbican in the outer wall. Henry III often {{used it as a}} residence, and it {{played an important role in}} the barons' war when it was besieged twice in 1264-5. Part of the castle had been being used as a gaol by 1185 and it was probably then the official county gaol, as <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> by 1228, and Eleanor of Brittany, niece of King John and cousin of Henry III with a better claim to the throne according to primogeniture and thus becoming a state prisoner, had been briefly imprisoned there during the reign of John, from 1222 to 1223, and from 1237 to 1238, and for the second time its prisoners had to be transferred to accommodate her.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Justice Stevens, {{speech that}} {{embodied}} a religious purpose fell into three categories. [...] One category included speech that approached a particular topic from a religious perspective. [...] Another category included speech that [...] "amounts to worship, or its equivalent." [...] Between these two categories, Stevens posited a third category—religious proselytizing. [...] This case, then, involved a government entity attempting {{to open its}} facilities to allow the first category of religious speech on its property but not the other two categories. [...] Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new members to join a political organization. [...] If a school decides to authorize afterschool discussions of current events in its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions. [...] But must it therefore allow organized political groups—for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan—to hold meetings, the principal purpose of {{which is not to}} discuss the current-events topic from their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their respective groups? [...] I think not. [...] Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine the school's educational mission. [...] School officials may reasonably believe that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith may pose the same risk. [...] Even if the Club's speech was not properly classified as religious worship, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> religious proselytism, and the school was within its rights to exclude the Club from campus.|$|E
