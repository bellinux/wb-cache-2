Sera showing apparent false positive and apparent <b>false</b> negative <b>reactions</b> were identified, and were subjected to supplementary testing as appropriate. The serum agglutination test (SAT) gave 35 % apparent <b>false</b> negative <b>reactions</b> and 5 % apparent false positives. The complement fixation test (CFT) gave 12 % apparent <b>false</b> negative <b>reactions</b> using warm fixation (CFTW) and at least 5 % using cold fixation (CFTC). The routine diagnostic system used in Victoria, in which the CFTW is supplemented by the CFTC and the SAT, gave 9 % apparent <b>false</b> negative <b>reactions</b> and 2 % apparent <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions.</b> The radioimmunoassay gave 1 % or 6 % apparent <b>false</b> negative <b>reactions,</b> depending on the minimum diagnostic value used.

We evaluated {{the performance of}} the LIFECODES HLA-DQB 1 typing kit (Immu-cor, USA) using sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe and Luminex platform (Lu-minex Corp., USA) on 100 samples tested by sequence-based typing (SBT) using the Al-leleSEQR HLA-DQB 1 kit (Abbott Molecular, USA) in Korean individuals. No sample showed ambiguity in the assignment of 4 -digit HLA-DQB 1 allele with the LIFECODES HLA-DQB 1 SSO typing kit, and the results were fully concordant with those of high-resolution typing of AlleleSEQR HLA-DQB 1 SBT up to 4 -digit level. Three samples required adjustment of <b>false</b> <b>reactions</b> (3 / 100, 3. 0 %) : two samples with DQB 1 * 03 : 03 /* 06 : 01 showed false-positive re-sult in probe 253, and 1 sample with DQB 1 * 04 : 02 /* 05 : 02 showed false-negative result in probe 217. We tested an additional sample with DQB 1 * 03 : 03 /* 06 : 01, which showed same false-positivity in probe 253 and 2 samples with DQB 1 * 04 : 02 /* 05 : 02, which showed no <b>false</b> <b>reaction.</b> The <b>false</b> <b>reactions</b> did not result in ambiguity or change in the HLA allele assignment. We could assign HLA-DQB 1 alleles to 4 digit-level without ambiguity, with 100 % concordance with the SBT results. Thus, LIFECODES HLA-DQB 1 SSO typing ki...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>tests</b> {{are typical}} tests {{from the field}} of {{psychological}} research and communication science in which a test person is presented some stimulus like a photo, a sound, or written words. The individual has to evaluate the stimulus as fast as possible in a predefined manner and has to react by presenting the result of the evaluation. This could be by pushing a button in simple <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> or by saying an answer in verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>reaction</b> time between the onset of the stimulus and the onset of the response {{can be used as a}} degree of difficulty for performing the given evaluation. Compared to simple <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> are very powerful since the individual can simply say the answer which is the most natural way of answering. The drawback for verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> is that today the reaction times still have to be determined manually. This means that a person has to listen through all audio recordings taken during test sessions and mark stimuli times and word beginnings one by one which is very time consuming and people-intensive. To replace the manual evaluation of <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> this article presents the REACTION (Reaction Time Determination) system which can automatically determine the reaction times of a test session by analyzing the audio recording of the session. The system automatically detects the onsets of stimuli as well as the onsets of answers. The recording is furthermore segmented into parts each containing one stimulus and the following reaction which further facilitates the transcription of the spoken words for a semantic evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{kidney disease}} (BKD), caused by Renibacterium salmoninarum, is classed as a {{notifiable}} disease under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937. It {{is a list}} III disease as specified in Annex A of Council Directive 91 / 67 /EEC (1991). The UK government has opted to maintain movement controls on fish farms and hatcheries found to be infected with R. salmoninarum, as {{it is believed that}} the bacterium is not widespread but poses a significant risk to farmed and wild fish populations. This study took a newly developed PCR technique, designed to detect the presence of R. salmoninarum in fish samples, and validated it for use in both wild fish and farmed fish surveys. Validation studies found that the technique gave <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions</b> when <b>tested</b> with high concentrations of Yersinia ruckeri, a common fish pathogen. The nature of the false cross-reaction was determined and the primers redesigned to ensure specificity. PCR reagents and cycling conditions were optimised to give the modified technique a sensitivity of between 10 ¹ and 10 ² R. salmoninarum cfu/mg head kidney material. A cross-sectional survey of R. salmoninarum infection in farmed rainbow trout, and wild fish populations, was carried out in ten farms and six rivers, respectively, using the validated PCR technique. Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) were the main wild species tested. Two fish, one grayling and one salmon (Salmo salar), were R. salmoninarum culture positive compared to 46 confirmed PCR positive fish. The highest prevalence of R. salmoninarum infection was found in grayling in rivers that had rainbow trout farms with a history of R. salmoninarum infection. One hundred and fifty fish were sampled from each rainbow trout farm, but none of the fish was found to be R. salmoninarum positive. Evidence was found, for the first time, for the presence of R. salmoninarum in an eel...|$|R

This study was designed to assess the role of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in producing <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions</b> in the Captia Syph G EIA. The role of rheumatoid factor (RF) as a potential source of false positives was also analysed. METHODS [...] Patients who attended a genitourinary medicine (GUM) department and gave a <b>false</b> positive <b>reaction</b> with the EIA between 1988 and 1990 were compared with women undergoing antenatal testing and with the control clinic population (EIA negative) over the same time period. The incidence of sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the clinic population and the false positive reactors was measured in relation to gonorrhoea, chlamydia, genital warts, candidiasis, "other conditions not requiring treatment" and "other conditions requiring treatment. " Male: female sex ratios were also compared. Ninety two RF positive sera were analysed with the EIA. RESULTS [...] The rate of <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions</b> did not differ with respect to the diagnosis within the GUM clinic population. The antenatal group of women, however, had a lower incidence of <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions</b> than the GUM clinic group. No RF positive sera were positive on Captia Syph G EIA testing. CONCLUSIONS [...] There is no cross reaction between Captia Syph G EIA and any specific STD or with RF positive sera. The lower incidence of <b>false</b> positive <b>reactions</b> in antenatal women is unexplained but may be related to physiological changes associated with pregnancy...|$|R

On the cognitive ability <b>test,</b> pretest <b>reactions</b> affected <b>test</b> performance and mediated the relationship between belief in tests and test performance. Test performance affected posttest reactions even after taking into account the effect of pretest reactions.

40|$|Since it {{was held}} in 1924 by Becher to be of value indetermining the degree of renal {{insufficiency}} and consequently in predicting the probable result of patients with renal disease xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> has had extensive clinical applications. In recent years, however, clearance test has established themselves as renal function <b>test,</b> and xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> has become somewhat outdated and less used than before. In order to review the value of xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> and to determine the position at present occupied by it among many renal function tests used as a diagnostic aid, various tests were performed {{and the results were}} compared. The normal value of plasma xanthoprotein reaction level was shown to be 17. 9 ± 0. 6; plasma xanthoprotein reaction was normal in acute nephritis; and it increased as renal function deteriorated in chronic and terminal nephritis. In renal diseases the increase in plasma xanthoprotein reaction levels occurred slightly after the increase in plasma urea-N and plasma creatinine levels. The increase in plasma xanthoprotein levels occurred when glomerulo-tubular unbalance took place, with the values of G. F. R., R. P. F., R. B.
