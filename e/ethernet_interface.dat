25|$|The Bandai ATMARK-EX was {{to feature}} a {{footprint}} {{similar to a}} Macintosh desktop unit. It was designed to include 8 MB of RAM (expandable to 40 MB,) {{and the ability to}} utilize standard 72-pin EDO-DRAM modules, instead of the proprietary memory modules used in the ATMARK and @WORLD. The chassis could handle a half-sized PCI card internally. The displayed unit contained a PCI card-based <b>Ethernet</b> <b>interface,</b> as well as a built-in analog modem. An infrared-based ADB interface was also designed into the prototype, which would have opened up a new line of peripherals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Evans & Sutherland (E) {{decoupled}} their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own display information transformable through a dataflow architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a serial line (e.g. 9600, 56K baud) or <b>Ethernet</b> <b>interface</b> and then manipulated without {{impact on the}} host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months trying to fit such activities into this architecture. E designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine {{in an attempt to}} simplify this process but it was so difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.|$|E

50|$|To {{connect the}} cable modem network to the Internet, a ComController {{had one or}} more network modules.

40|$|Abstract—Reducing {{the power}} {{consumption}} of network inter-faces contributes to lowering the overall power {{needs of the}} com-pute and communication infrastructure. Most modern <b>Ethernet</b> <b>interfaces</b> can operate at one of several data rates. In this paper, we present Queue Length Based Rate Adaptation (QLBRA), which can dynamically adapt the link rate for <b>Ethernet</b> <b>interfaces</b> at runtime using existing Ethernet standards. An implementation of the proposed rate adaptation functionality is demonstrated at runtime on a NetFPGA platform. Our {{results show that the}} rate adaptation approach can achieve significant energy savings {{and at the same time}} improve the throughput of TCP traffic due to the effect of packet pacing.
