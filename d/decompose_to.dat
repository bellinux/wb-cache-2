5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> eliminate a β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is {{the reaction of}} ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> {{steam and}} oxygen.Hydrazine <b>decomposes</b> energetically <b>to</b> nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia (2N2H4 → N2+H2+2NH3) {{and is the}} most widely used in space vehicles. Ammonia decomposition is endothermic and would decrease performance. Nitrous oxide <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> nitrogen and oxygen.Steam when externally heated gives a reasonably modest Isp of up to 190 seconds, depending on material corrosion and thermal limits.|$|R
25|$|Anhydrous AuCl3 {{begins to}} <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> AuCl at around 160°C; however, {{this in turn}} {{undergoes}} disproportionation at higher temperatures to give gold metal and AuCl3.|$|E
25|$|Heat and {{especially}} acids cause formic acid to <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> carbon monoxide (CO) and water (dehydration). Treatment of formic acid with sulfuric acid is a convenient laboratory source of CO.|$|E
25|$|Most metal nitrates {{thermally}} <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> {{the respective}} oxides, but silver oxide decomposes {{at a lower}} temperature than silver nitrate, so the decomposition of silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead.|$|E

50|$|Under laser {{irradiation}} at a {{wavelength of}} less than 520 nm, it <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> plutonium pentafluoride and fluorine; after more irradiation it <b>decomposes</b> further <b>to</b> plutonium tetrafluoride.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{stability}} of their complexation with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium ferrocyanide E535, Potassium ferrocyanide E536, and Calcium ferrocyanide E538) do not <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> lethal levels {{in the human body}} and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an anticaking agent in table salt.|$|E
25|$|Salt marshes {{are quite}} photosynthetically active and are {{extremely}} productive habitats. They serve as depositories {{for a large}} amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the halophytic plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds.|$|E
25|$|These {{transnational}} {{political and}} legal ramifications threw a veil of secrecy around the disaster and obstructed the discovery of vital medical and toxicologic information. The medical community was often frustrated in its attempts to understand the links between gas exposure and health and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, ignorance about whether the main poison, methyl isocyanate, could <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> deadly cyanide gas, led to years of acrimonious debate {{on the merits of}} treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Incongruent melting {{occurs when}} a solid {{substance}} does not melt uniformly, decomposing into another solid and a liquid with different compositions. For example, potassium feldspar (KAlSi3O8) <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> leucite (KAlSi2O6) when it melts. The decomposition is not complete, however. Most of the feldspar does melt, a portion of it <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> leucite and some quartz (SiO2) is left over, since the chemical formulas of potassium feldspar and leucite differ by SiO2. Another mineral that melts incongruently is enstatite (MgSiO3), which <b>decomposes</b> <b>to</b> forsterite (Mg2SiO4). Enstatite does melt congruently between pressures of 2.5 and 5.5 kilobars.|$|R

25|$|Rhodizonic {{acid and}} the rhodizonate anion can lose {{one of the}} CO units to yield croconic acid (CO)3(COH)2 and the croconate anion C5O52, respectively, by {{mechanisms}} that are still imperfectly known. In basic solutions (pH > 10), rhodizonic acid quickly converts to the THBQ anion (CO)64 {{in the absence of}} oxygen, and to croconic acid in its presence. At pH 8.3 and exposure to light, solutions are stable for days in the absence of oxygen, and <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> croconic acid and other products (possibly including cyclohexanehexone or dodecahydroxycyclohexane) in its presence.|$|E
25|$|Hexaborides, LnB6 {{have been}} {{reported}} {{for all of the}} lanthanides. They all have the CaB6 structure, containing B6 clusters. They are non-stoichiometric due to cation defects. The hexaborides of the lighter lanthanides (La – Sm) melt without decomposition, EuB6 decomposes to boron and metal and the heavier lanthanides <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> LnB4 with exception of YbB6 which decomposes forming YbB12. The stability has in part been correlated to differences in volatility between the lanthanide metals. In EuB6 and YbB6 the metals have an oxidation state of +2 whereas {{in the rest of the}} lanthanide hexaborides it is +3. This rationalises the differences in conductivity, the extra electrons in the LnIII hexaborides entering conduction bands. EuB6 is a semiconductor and the rest are good conductors. LaB6 and CeB6 are thermionic emitters, used, for example, in scanning electron microscopes.|$|E
25|$|All five {{chemically}} characterised pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form compounds with thorium. Three thorium nitrides are known: ThN, Th3N4, and Th2N3. The brass-coloured Th3N4 is {{most easily}} produced by heating thorium metal in a nitrogen atmosphere. Th3N4 and Th2N3 <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> the golden-yellow ThN, and indeed ThN {{can often be}} seen covering the surface of Th3N4 samples because Th3N4 is hygroscopic and water vapour in the air can decompose it: thin films of ThN are metallic in character and, like all other actinide mononitrides, has the sodium chloride structure. ThN is also a low-temperature superconductor. All three nitrides can react with thorium halides to form halide nitrides ThNX (X = F, Cl, Br, I). The heavier pnictogens also form analogous monopnictides, except ThBi which {{has not yet been}} structurally characterised. The other well-characterised thorium pnictides are Th3P4, Th2P11, ThP7, Th3As4, ThAs2, Th3Sb4, ThSb2, and ThBi2.|$|E

5|$|Gallane is {{unstable}} above −10°C, <b>decomposing</b> <b>to</b> elemental gallium and hydrogen.|$|R
25|$|The silanes {{comprise}} a homologous series of silicon hydrides {{with the general}} formula SinH2n+2. They are all strong reducing agents. Unbranched and branched trains are known up to n = 8, and the cycles Si5H10 and Si6H12 are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after eight months have passed). They <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> form polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen gas. As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more volatile than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitates nucleophilic attack at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si–H bond compared to the C–H bond, {{and the ability of}} silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's activation energy.|$|E
25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

5000|$|Early in decomposition, {{carbohydrates}} will {{be broken}} down by microorganisms. The process begins with the breakdown of glycogen into glucose monomers. [...] These sugar monomers can be completely <b>decomposed</b> <b>to</b> carbon dioxide and water or incompletely <b>decomposed</b> <b>to</b> various organic acids and alcohols, or other oxygenated species, such as ketones, aldehydes, esters and ethers.|$|R
500|$|There {{are some}} {{theoretical}} indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible. If {{they could be}} synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, {{that could be used}} as powerful propellants or explosives. This is because they should all <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (bond energy 946kJ⋅mol−1) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418kJ⋅mol−1) or the N–N single bond (160kJ⋅mol−1): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.) A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide (...) , pentazenium (...) , and pentazolide (cyclic aromatic [...] ). Under extremely high pressures (1.1millionatm) and high temperatures (2000K), as produced in a diamond anvil cell, nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure. This structure {{is similar to that of}} diamond, and both have extremely strong covalent bonds, resulting in its nickname [...] "nitrogen diamond".|$|E
2500|$|Because {{tetrafluoroethylene}} can explosively <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> tetrafluoromethane and carbon, special apparatus {{is required}} for the polymerization to prevent hot spots that might initiate this dangerous side reaction.

The 1:2 complex adopts a trigonal bipyramidal structure. [...] Some adducts (e.g. dimethylethylamine alane, NMe2Et · AlH3) thermally <b>decompose</b> <b>to</b> give aluminium metal and may have use in MOCVD applications.|$|E
