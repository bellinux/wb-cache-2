25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
40|$|Lean NOx Trap (LNT) {{catalysts}} {{are capable}} of reducing NOx in lean exhaust from diesel engines. NOx is stored on the catalyst during lean operation; then, under rich exhaust conditions, the NOx is released from and reduced by the catalyst. The process of NOx release and reduction is called regeneration. One method of obtaining the rich conditions for regeneration is to inject additional fuel into the engine cylinders while throttling the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> to effectively run the engine at rich air:fuel ratios; this method is called “in-cylinder” regeneration. In-cylinder regeneration of LNT catalysts has been demonstrated and is a candidate emission control technique for commercialization of light-duty diesel vehicles to meet future emission regulations. In the study presented here, a 1. 7 -liter diesel engine with a LNT catalyst system {{was used to evaluate}} in-cylinder regeneration techniques. Characterization of the exhaust reductant chemistry during in-cylinder regeneration was performed. The effects of various injection strategies and fuels and the resulting exhaust chemistry on the performance of the LNT catalyst were analyzed. In addition, exhaust species measurement of NOx and select reductants were performed inside of the catalyst cells with a capillary-based mass spectrometry technique. The effect of various injection parameters on exhaust chemistry species and LNT performance are discussed. Results indicate that fuel chemistry does affect engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) species, but not engine-out carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen (H 2) generation. Higher engine-out CO and H 2 correlate to improved NOx reduction, irrespective of HCs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} {{the effect of}} various lubricant and engine temperatures on the <b>intake</b> mass <b>air</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>engine</b> noise and lubricant pressure behaviour of a motor-driven spark ignition engine. The lubricant pressure, engine noise and mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> changes were recorded under a steady state operating condition with an increased engine speed in which both the volume and temperature of the lubricant remained unchanged for each sets of test. The engine was driven by an electric motor at a wide-open throttle and a constant speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. The lubricant and cooling water were set at 32 °C (unheated) and 90 °C (heated) for each run. In general, {{the pressure of the}} lubricant was found to decrease for either increased engine speed or lubricant temperature. It was found that high lubricant viscosity produced high overall engine friction and resulted to a higher engine noise. Heated lubricant started off with a very low pressure with 0. 996 bar compared to unheated lubricant with 2. 497 bar in 500 rpm. Unheated engine lubricant recorded a peak noise of 107. 2 dB at 1500 rpm before it dropped momentarily before increased linearly beyond this speed. The findings in this work are useful for researchers in the field of automotive technologies, environmental and triblogies.

It is a steady state simulation using Multiple Reference Frame model for the fan. The results are in a good agreement with the outsourced transient simulation which was used a reference. The performance of the fan model is better than expected and the system mass flow is higher than the one in the reference simulation. When compared to the Limiting Ambient Temperature test the results show moderate agreement.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the diesel engine {{performance}} and drivability have significantly improved with the latest technologic developments. Nevertheless, one of the disadvantageous of diesel engines {{is related to the}} difficulties for starting at cold conditions, particularly in the conditions where the ambient temperature is near or below 0 ºC. Additionally, the harmful exhaust emissions are also at significantly important levels during the cold start conditions. Most of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from diesel engines are produced during the engine warm-up period.   In order to improve cold start characteristics of diesel engines, many measures have been proposed, such as glow plugs and air heaters in <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> lines. In this study, in order to increase the cold start performance and improve the exhaust emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine, phase change materials (PCMs) have been used. PCMs have high heats of fusion and they can absorb latent energy before melting. During the phase change, temperature of PCMs remains nearly constant. In this study, a PCMs was used with the 45 - 51 ºC melting temperature band in a heat exchanger. Hot water from an external source was circulated in the exchanger to carry out the experiments in the same conditions and was used as heat source in order to melt the PCMs. <b>Engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> has been passed through the exchanger before <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> manifold.   During the engine cooling period, the PCM in the produced heat exchanger have increased the cooling time period of <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> An experimental setup has been established to observe the cold start characteristics of the two cylinder diesel engine with and without using the produced exchanger. Temperature measurements from different points, CO exhaust emissions, engine speed and in cylinder pressure measurements have been used to evaluate the contribution of exchanger and increasing the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature by using the PCMs. The experiments have been carried out at different PCMs and ambient temperatures. The increase in the temperature of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> at low ambient temperatures assists the engine cold start performance, decreases the starting time of engine and improves the engine exhaust emissions characteristics...|$|R
