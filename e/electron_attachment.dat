A plasmonic metallic core is employed for light capture and local electro-magnetic field enhancement.

To circumvent the re{{distribution of}} soluble or weakly bound elements, freeze-dried cryosections of spores, which had been rapidly frozen in 50 % aqueous polyvinyl pyrrolidone, were employed. The sections were examined by using a modified Philips EM 400 electron microscope fitted with a field emission gun, scanning transmission <b>electron</b> microscopy <b>attachment,</b> and a computer-linked energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis system.

40|$|Mars' dynamic {{atmosphere}} displays localized {{dust devils}} and larger, global dust storms. Based on terrestrial analog studies, electrostatic modeling, and laboratory work these features will contain large electrostatic fields formed via triboelectric processes. In the low-pressure Martian atmosphere, these fields may create an electron avalanche and collisional plasma {{due to an}} increase in electron density driven by the internal electrical forces. To test the hypothesis that an electron avalanche is sustained under these conditions, a self-consistent atmospheric process model is created including electron impact ionization sources and electron losses via dust absorption, <b>electron</b> dissociation <b>attachment,</b> and electron/ion recombination. This new model is called the Dust Devil Electron Avalanche Model (DDEAM). This model solves simultaneously nine continuity equations describing the evolution of the primary gaseous chemical species involved in the electrochemistry. DDEAM monitors the evolution of the electrons and primary gas constituents, including electron/water interactions. We especially focus on electron dynamics and follow the electrons as they evolve in the E field driven collisional gas. When sources and losses are self-consistently included in the electron continuity equation, the electron density grows exponentially with increasing electric field, reaching an equilibrium that forms a sustained time-stable collisional plasma. However, the character of this plasma differs depending upon the assumed growth rate saturation process (chemical saturation versus space charge). DDEAM also shows the possibility of the loss of atmospheric methane as a function of electric field due to <b>electron</b> dissociative <b>attachment</b> of the hydrocarbon. The methane destruction rates are presented and can be included in other larger atmospheric models...|$|R
50|$|Photoresists {{can also}} be exposed by {{electron}} beams, producing the same results as exposure by light. The main difference is that while photons are absorbed, depositing all their energy at once, electrons deposit their energy gradually, and scatter within the photoresist during this process. As with high-energy wavelengths, many transitions are excited by electron beams, and heating and outgassing are still a concern. The dissociation energy for a C-C bond is 3.6 eV. Secondary electrons generated by primary ionizing radiation have energies sufficient to dissociate this bond, causing scission. In addition, the low-energy electrons have a longer photoresist interaction time due to their lower speed; essentially the electron has to be at rest {{with respect to the}} molecule in order to react most strongly via dissociative <b>electron</b> <b>attachment,</b> where the electron comes to rest at the molecule, depositing all its kinetic energy. The resulting scission breaks the original polymer into segments of lower molecular weight, which are more readily dissolved in a solvent, or else releases other chemical species (acids) which catalyze further scission reactions (see the discussion on chemically amplified resists below).It is not common to select photoresists for electron-beam exposure. Electron beam lithography usually relies on resists dedicated specifically to electron-beam exposure.|$|E

Electron transfer from Geobacter sulfurreducens cells to electrodes or metal oxides requires proper expression and localization of redox-active proteins {{as well as}} attachment mechanisms that interface bacteria with surfaces and other cells. Type IV pili and c -type cytochromes have long been considered important components of this conductive network. In this work, a large-scale mutagenesis of G. sulfurreducens was performed and mutants were screened for extracellular <b>electron</b> transfer and <b>attachment</b> phenotypes, identifying new genes essential for a conductive Geobacter network. A mutant defective in polysaccharide export to the extracellular matrix (&# 916; 1501, &# 916; xapD::kan) was identified based on its altered surface attachment. Characterization of this mutant revealed the importance of extracellular polysaccharides for proper attachment and anchoring of the external c -type cytochromes necessary for a conductive biofilm network. Furthermore, decreased polysaccharide content was found in commonly studied cytochrome and type IV pili mutants, with defects in cell to cell and cell to surface attachment correlating with levels of extracellular polysaccharides.

The effect of various agents upon this interaction has been determined by monitoring the appearance of this protein by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination.

Our results reveal a comprehensive physical {{picture of the}} {{relaxation process}}, including the main plasma variables, after a perturbation up to the full recovery of the steady state. A strong influence of the photodetachment on the discharge is found, which results from an increase of the electron density, leading to a weaker bulk field, and hence to {{a drop in the}} high energy tail of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), a reduction of the reaction rates of <b>electron</b> impact <b>attachment</b> and ionization, and a subsequent decrease of the positive and negative ion densities.
