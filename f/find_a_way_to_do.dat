[...] "It does not seem possible, at least in the near future", he wrote, [...] "to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E

[...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if we are willing to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E

Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir I Dreamed of Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, {{and the importance of}} producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue to coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, [...] "Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. [...] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling. Deafening applause burst out from the crowd, while television crews {{from all over the world}} showed to every corner of the Earth this new sacrifice of Africa." ...|$|E

[...] Wallenda lives by the mantra [...] "Never Give Up". [...] He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. [...] "I think [...] what life is about", he remarks.

6000|$|Such separation, if ever {{effected}} at all, must be {{effected by}} colonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing anything directly for colonization. Party operations at present only favor or retard colonization incidentally. The enterprise {{is a difficult}} one; but [...] "where there is a will there is a way," [...] and what colonization needs most is a hearty will. Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and self-interest. Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, {{and at the same}} time favorable to, or at least not against, our interest to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, however great the task may be.

6000|$|Now, {{in regard}} to this matter of the Dred Scott {{decision}}, I wish {{to say a word}} or two. After all, the Judge will not say whether, if a decision is made holding that the people of the States cannot exclude slavery, he will support it or not. He obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case. The judges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject. Before this I reminded him that at Galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary, and you remember that in my Opening speech I told him I had the book containing that decision here, and I would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said. He has occupied his hour and a half, and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion. He never will. But he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott decision. Judge Douglas ought to know how. Did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the National Bank? Didn't they <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed, so far as its practical operation is concerned? ...|$|E

6000|$|So {{one might}} {{go on in}} regard to {{a vast number of}} things, petty and large alike; the list would seem {{overwhelming}} until the countervailing considerations came into play. But, as a matter of fact, there is hardly an age or a race that does not show us something better done than ever it was before or since, because at no time has human effort ceased and absolutely failed. Isolated eminence is no proof of general elevation. Always in this field or that, whether it was in the binding of books or the enamelling of metal, the refinement of language or the assertion of liberty, particular men have, by a sort of necessity, grasped at occasion, [...] "found themselves," [...] as the saying goes, and done the best that was in them. So always while man endures, whatever else betide, one may feel assured at this or that special thing some men will <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and get to the crown of endeavour. Such considerations of decline in particular things from the standard of the past do not really affect the general assertion of a continuous accumulating betterment in the lot of men, do not invalidate the hopes of those who believe in the power of men to end for ever many of the evils that now darken the world, who look to the reservoirs of human possibility as a supply as yet scarcely touched, who make of all the splendour and superiorities of the past no more than a bright promise and suggestion for the unborn future our every act builds up, into which, whether we care or no, all our achievements pour.|$|E
