5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect <b>for</b> <b>accuracy</b> on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{star was}} studied through the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph's (MIKE) {{ability to use}} Doppler {{spectroscopy}} to measure radial velocity. Twenty-four measurements were recorded for HD 205739.

30|$|As {{it can be}} observed, we {{have similar}} results as the ones {{obtained}} in intra-subject methodology. The highest 16 PF traits’ prediction accuracy is obtained when 63 subjects {{are used in the}} training phase, and the proposed architecture is tested on the remaining subject, in both phases using samples acquired in controlled scenarios. In this case, we obtain 84 % prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> sensitivity, 82.2 % prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> social boldness, 80.4 % prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> liveliness and warmth, 80.3 % prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> emotional stability, and over 75 % prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> vigilance and tension. Similarly, when samples acquired in random scenarios are used for training and testing, the prediction <b>accuracy</b> <b>for</b> all 16 PF traits decreases with up to 4 %.|$|R
5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination <b>for</b> <b>accuracy</b> and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived <b>for</b> <b>accuracy</b> and {{presented}} up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|Yet both {{reflect an}} inseparable {{integrity}} and regard <b>for</b> <b>accuracy</b> and truth, {{expressed in terms}} both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the Historia, felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and {{that as a result}} miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both <b>for</b> <b>accuracy</b> and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
