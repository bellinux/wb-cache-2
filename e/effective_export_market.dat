40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of the internationalization process of Croatian SME exporters. The traditional theory of internationalization suggests that the firm gradually develops an international presence. On the contrary, born global approach indicated that firms can internationalize instantly on a full scale by avoiding incremental steps. However the born global approach to internationalization confirmed that, besides informational and resource based perspective, intangible assets (capabilities) should be assessed. Global mindset represents a viable latent capability of exporting firm, especially the SME. The findings suggest that a significant relationship between global mindset and <b>export</b> <b>market</b> orientation exists suggesting that managerial cognition fosters <b>effective</b> <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop and {{estimate}} an integrated empirical model of export performance. The paper aims to adopt an eclectic approach, which synthesises the literature to identify key determinants and then applies the model to Greek food and beverage exporters. Design/methodology/approach – This paper identifies the determinants of export performance from a literature review. An integrated structural equation model is then developed to estimate the directions and magnitudes of their interdependencies. Findings – Results show that the determinants of export performance are the <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> mix, entrepreneurial orientation, trade barriers and export problems. In turn, the <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> mix is indirectly determined by <b>export</b> <b>market</b> attractiveness, <b>export</b> competencies, and management. Practical implications – The multidimensional approach of this paper provides for a more integrated understanding of export performance than many of the partial studies found in the literature hitherto. Originality/value – The paper identifies generic factors that are important for successful <b>export</b> <b>marketing.</b> These are incorporated into a structural equation model, which estimates their impacts and interdependencies on export performance simultaneously. The findings can aid Greek food and beverage exporters to formulate <b>effective</b> <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies...|$|R

While France, Italy, and Portugal have experienced substantial <b>export</b> <b>market</b> share losses, Greece and Spain performed relatively well. <b>Export</b> <b>market</b> share losses appear associated with rigidities in resource allocation (sectoral, geographical, technological) relative to peers and lower productivity gains in high value-added sectors.

The author adopts a discrete-time survival model in his empirical investigation and further executes several extensions and robustness checks to the baseline results. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows: First, an exchange rate appreciation {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>export</b> <b>market</b> exit, reduces the capability of <b>export</b> <b>market</b> survival and decreases the probability of <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry. Second, high productivity firms are less likely to exit from <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> and more likely to enter and survive in <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> in the period of exchange rate appreciation. Third, exchange rate appreciation decreases the likelihood of <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entering and increases the likelihood of <b>export</b> <b>market</b> exiting more for private-owned firms, young firms and non-eastern firms.

The effects of governmental <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> support on firms' exporting activity is found a limited researched issue in international marketing, particularly the measurement of the effects of export promotion programmes (EPPs). Such programmes specifically are directed at assisting exporters' <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry.;The study addresses the role and effectiveness of <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> support as the acquisition of such support is influenced by management's orientation and information search and use behaviour (Reid, 1984; Katiskeas and Piercy, 1993). The analysis involves:; 1 - A comparison of the sample groups of programmes' users (UEP) and programmes' non-users (NUEP).; 2 - A detailed investigation of the export promotion programmes (EPPs) in <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry.;Overall, the thesis findings suggest that certain behavioural differences exist between firms using export promotion programmes (EPPs) in their <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry and the firms not using EPPs.

However, users of programmes seem more organised and proactive in <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> activity.;Measurement of the effectiveness of export promotion programmes (EPPs), however, appears complicated by a variety of factors which could not be clearly attributed to the use of EPPs.

30|$|As {{we see in}} Fig.  9, Turkey’s HH market {{concentration}} index was highest in 2008, during the global financial crisis. As mentioned, Turkey has diversified its <b>export</b> <b>market</b> to MENA countries to compensate for a decreasing share of European Union markets.
