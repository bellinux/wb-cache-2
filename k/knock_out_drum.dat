5000|$|March 23, 2005: Texas City Refinery {{explosion}}. An explosion {{occurred at}} a BP refinery in Texas City, Texas. It is the third largest refinery in the United States {{and one of the}} largest in the world, processing 433,000 barrels of crude oil per day and accounting for 3% of that nations gasoline supply. Over 100 were injured, and 15 were confirmed dead, including employees of Jacobs Engineering and the Fluor Corporation as well as BP. BP has since accepted that its employees contributed to the accident. Several level indicators failed, leading to overfilling of a <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> <b>drum,</b> and light hydrocarbons concentrated at ground level throughout the area. A nearby running diesel truck set off the explosion.|$|E
40|$|Process {{safety is}} a disciplined {{framework}} {{for managing the}} integrity of operating systems and processes handling hazardous substances. It is achieved by applying good design principles, engineering, and operating and maintenance practices. Flare systems {{play an important role}} in the safety of Oil and Gas installations by serving as outlets for emergency pressure relief in case of process upsets. Accurate and reliable estimation of system thermo-hydraulic parameters, especially system back-pressure is critical to the integrity of a flare system design. Accurate design of the flare system plays a key role in containing possible process safety hazards on the oil and gas installation, especially oil and gas offshore platforms. In order to enable uniformity and consistency, design guidelines and constraints are provided within the industry, both national and international standards - NORSOK, API and ISO - which serve as recommended practice in process and flare system design. This thesis is focused on analyzing the back-pressure build-up in the high pressure flare system at Kollsnes gas processing plant. The relief scenario considered in this thesis is pool fire case in condensate system in Kollsnes gas processing plant. The simulation tool used to model the flare system in this case is Aspen Tech's Flare system analyzer (known as FLARENET), is a steady state simulation tool. The FLARENET model includes the pressure safety valves (PSV), downstream tail pipes, flare header, flare <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> <b>drum</b> and flare stack. All the actual plant data are given as input to the model so as to get the more practical result. After running the simulation model, it emerges that for a total relieving rate of 108. 33 kg/sec (Vapor flow) in pool fire scenario, the back-pressure generated at some of the PSV's in the relief network is 10. 6 Barg against their set pressure of 10 Barg. This raises serious process safety concern as the relieving rate from the PSVs is drastically reduced due to very high back-pressure, which in turn will increase the pressure inside the process equipment exposed to fire. This concern has been conveyed to the Kollsnes plant operations group. To verify the results obtained from FLARENET simulation, I had undertaken actual plant verification. This was carried out in co-ordination with the Kollsnes plant operations group during September 2012, just before annual maintenance shutdown of the plant. The back-pressure results obtained as a result of controlled blow-down from the plant matched well with the FLARENET simulation results. Further follow up tasks is being under taken by Statoil ASA to alleviate the back-pressure problem. This thesis suggests two options for solving the problems. Further evaluation of the suggestion and its implementation in the plant is going on in the company. This thesis also opens door for further research on high back-pressure in flare system and analyze the problem dynamically. This will reduce the conservative steady state assumptions and will have much wider industrial acceptability with respect to cost savings potential...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo-phase gas-liquid flow along {{pipeline}} {{will tend}} to unavoidable non-stable condition e. g. slugging flow. Slug flow can pose serious problems to the equipments and operator of these flow systems. High fluctuating rates of gas and liquid can severely reduce the production and in the worst case shutdown or damage topside equipments like free water <b>knock</b> <b>out</b> <b>drums.</b> The modelling of two-phase flow systems over recent years become commonplace. This has been {{a direct result of}} stringent requirements to adopt the latest technology in health, safety and pipeline integrity analysis. In recent study, the carbon steel sub-sea pipeline with outer diameter 32 inch (ID. 30 inch) in order to transfer sour gas from South Pars gas field to a gas refinery with capacity 2000 MMSCFD for two phases (each phase 1000 MMSCFD) in south of Iran which has approximate length of 87 km is considered to simulate with PIPESIM software based on Beggs & Brill correlation for slug prediction in both vertical and horizontal pipes as well as Peng-Robinson equation of state to estimate gas physical properties. Based on our studies by increasing flow rate the amount of holdup and slug is decreased so that from 200 MMSCFD up to 1000 MMSCFD this value is almost decreased 32 % in the riser. In such simulation, care must be taken during the gathering of data for the parameters like pipeline elevation changes, flow and composition of fluids and pipeline operational pressure and ambient temperature...|$|R
