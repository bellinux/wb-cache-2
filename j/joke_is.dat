5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|Viola <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> a {{category}} of <b>jokes</b> which <b>are</b> directed towards violas and viola players. The <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> thought to have originated from the 18th century when {{the part of the}} viola was very uncomplicated and often just a filler part, thus attracting musicians who were not usually very talented musically.|$|R

25|$|Agents may modify schemas {{even though}} their use does not predictably {{accumulate}} resources. For example, {{the effect of a}} <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it based on the amount of laughter it garners regardless of this variability.|$|E
50|$|Identified {{as one of}} {{the simple}} forms of oral {{literature}} by the Dutch linguist , <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of <b>jokes</b> <b>is</b> told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. <b>Jokes</b> <b>are</b> also passed along in written form or, more recently, through the internet.|$|R
50|$|His famous <b>jokes</b> <b>were</b> {{available}} as three booklets but some pirated versions were also published.

In 1985 he was screened for about two minutes in a popular Nepali movie Kusume Rumal and it cleared that he is not just an imaginary character.|$|R
50|$|Especially {{during the}} {{communist}} regime, political <b>jokes</b> <b>were</b> very popular, {{although they were}} illegal and dangerous to tell. In the democratic Romania, these <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> still popular, although the themes changed: now the politicians are seen either, as hopelessly corrupt, greedy, or as nationalist madmen.|$|R
25|$|Intuitively, two {{spaces are}} homeomorphic {{if one can}} be {{deformed}} into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, a {{topological space}} is a {{geometric}} object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending {{of the object}} into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. An often-repeated mathematical <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> that topologists can't {{tell the difference between}} a coffee cup and a donut, since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cup's handle.|$|E

500|$|Batman: The Killing <b>Joke</b> <b>is</b> a 1988 DC Comics {{one-shot}} graphic novel {{featuring the}} characters Batman and the Joker written by Alan Moore {{and illustrated by}} Brian Bolland. The Killing Joke provides an origin story for the supervillain the Joker, loosely adapted from the 1951 story arc [...] "The Man Behind the Red Hood!". Taking place over two timelines, The Killing Joke depicts the Joker attempting to drive Jim Gordon insane and Batman's desperate attempt to stop him.|$|E

The Simpsons writer George Meyer, who enjoys writing jokes that involve anagrams {{or any other}} forms of word play, {{came up with the}} idea for this {{particular}} joke.

500|$|The Killing <b>Joke</b> <b>is</b> a {{story about}} Batman and the Joker; it isn't about {{anything}} that you're ever going to encounter in real life, because Batman and the Joker are not like any human beings that have ever lived.

It was just about a couple of licensed DC characters that didn't really relate to the real world in any way.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{various kinds}} of jokes {{in the framework of}} relevance theory (henceforth RT). RT can explain the workings of the brain and give more explicit and exhaustive argumentation about on-line joke interpretations. Topics include ad hoc concept construction, enrichment, reference assignment, six kinds of implicature-based jokes, definition jokes, metalinguistic jokes, three kinds of resemblance-based jokes, and frame-related ethnic <b>jokes.</b> Implicature-based <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> classified into four classes: a joke which comes from two contradictory implicatures; a joke which comes from an absurd assumption; a <b>joke</b> which <b>is</b> from an absurd implicature; and a <b>joke</b> which <b>is</b> from two contradictory assumptions. Resemblance-based <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> captured by a variety of resemblance relations: resemblance in sound, resemblance in syntactic and lexical forms and resemblance in propositional forms. I argue that jokes create two relevant interpretations in many ways, and the hearer appreciates the gap or difference between the two. Processing <b>jokes</b> <b>is</b> less economical than processing plain, explicit messages. Certain effort-demanding interpretive paths of <b>jokes</b> <b>are</b> favored in exchange for an increase in humorous effects. Key words: jokes, Relevance Theory, implicature-based jokes, resemblance-based jokes, metalinguistic jokes, definition jokes...|$|R

500|$|Speaking of {{the fifth}} season and Castiel's more {{frequent}} interactions with humans, Collins commented, [...] "Obviously the big <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> that he doesn't understand human beings and how they behave. And there is something inherently funny in that, especially if he's the straight man." [...] The actor noted {{he was a little}} hesitant at making the character into [...] "the funny guy", and was apprehensive about some moments in the early episodes of the season. However, he believes the writers have found [...] "the line", allowing for the jokes to be [...] "more subtle" [...] and [...] "a little more believable".|$|E

She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times.
