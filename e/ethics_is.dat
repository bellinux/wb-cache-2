Ethics are taught in accounting courses at higher education institutions as well as by companies training accountants and auditors.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|Medical <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> {{a system}} of moral {{principles}} that apply values {{to the practice of}} clinical medicine and in scientific research. Medical ethics allow for people, regardless of background, to be guaranteed quality and principled care. This applies to both the living and nonliving, such as medical research on cadavers. It creates an obvious guideline to follow. Medical <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. These tenets allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal without any conflict. It {{is important to note that}} these four values are of equal worth.|$|E
50|$|Hacker <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> a {{term for}} the moral values and {{philosophy}} that are common in hacker culture. In other words, those who possess positive hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is very beneficial and helpful. Whilst the philosophy originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s-1960s, the term hacker <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> attributed to journalist Steven Levy as described in his 1984 book titled Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. The key points within this <b>ethic</b> <b>are</b> access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life. While some tenets of hacker <b>ethic</b> <b>were</b> described in other texts like Computer Lib/Dream Machines (1974) by Ted Nelson, Levy {{appears to have been}} the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy.|$|R

25|$|The term {{medical ethics}} first {{dates back to}} 1803, when English author and {{physician}} Thomas Percival published a document describing the requirements and expectations of medical professionals within medical facilities. The Code of Ethics was then adapted in 1847, relying heavily on Percival’s words. Over the years in 1903, 1912, and 1947, revisions {{have been made to}} the original document. The practice of Medical <b>Ethics</b> <b>is</b> widely accepted and practiced throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{mainstream}} medical <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals are not free to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject to the ability to pay. Because the welfare state typically provides a high proportion of medical care, and because there are legal restrictions on what treatment may be provided and by whom, an automatic divergence may exist between patient wishes and the preferences of medical practitioners and other parties.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{have criticized}} Objectivist ethics. The philosopher Robert Nozick argues that Rand's foundational argument in <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> unsound {{because it does}} not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of begging the question. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to David Hume's famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers Douglas B. Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.|$|E

25|$|Jewish <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> {{the moral}} {{philosophy}} particular {{to one or}} both of the Jewish religion and peoples. Serving as a convergence of Judaism and the Western philosophical tradition of ethics, the diverse literature of Jewish ethics's broad range of moral concern classifies it as a type of normative ethics. For two millennia, Jewish thought has focussed on the interplay of ethics with the rule of law. The tradition of rabbinic religious law - Halakhah - addresses several problems associated with ethics, including its semi-permeable relation with duties that are usually not punished under law.|$|E
25|$|Jewish medical <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the major}} spheres of {{contemporary}} Jewish ethics. Beginning primarily as an applied ethics based on halakhah, more recently it has broadened to bioethics, weaving together issues in biology, science, medicine and ethics, philosophy and theology. Jewish bioethicists are usually rabbis who have been trained in medical science and philosophy, but may also be experts in medicine and ethics who have received training in Jewish texts. The goal of Jewish medical ethics and bioethics is to use Jewish law and tradition and Jewish ethical thought to determine which medical treatments or technological innovations are moral, when treatments {{may or may not be}} used, etc.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases such as Jew lawyer or Jew <b>ethics,</b> <b>is</b> both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.|$|E

25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> more concerned with developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E
25|$|As a {{theoretical}} or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated {{on the one}} hand to physical science and on the other to history. Its method is {{the same as that of}} physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of <b>ethics</b> <b>is</b> the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol and organ of mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his <b>Ethics</b> <b>is</b> scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

5000|$|The {{security}} <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> {{based in}} the oldest part of the brain, involving the R-complex or the extrapyrimidal action nervous system. [...] The security <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> triggered by the stress response which activates primal instincts and fight or flight responses. These are concerned or centered on safety, survival, and thriving in an environment (or biological system). With these systems present at birth, the security <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> conditioned during sensitive periods of development (such as infancy), life experience, and trauma. Studies have shown that a dearth of touch in early years result in an underdevelopment of serotonin receptors. Children with faulty serotonin receptors are susceptible to somatosensory affectional deprivation (SAD), a condition related to depression, violent behavior, and stimulus seeking. As an adult, if serotonin receptors are not properly functioning, an individual is more prone to depression and anxiety. If receptor are damaged, and one becomes fixated at this <b>ethic,</b> they can <b>be</b> seen as cold, closed-minded, and aggressive. This <b>ethic</b> <b>is</b> most responsible for racism and hate towards outside groups.|$|R
