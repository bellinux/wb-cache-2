40|$|The {{interest}} in flavour stability has strongly {{increased in the}} last years due to its relation with the quality and acceptability of food products. Fixation or encapsulation of flavour compounds protects flavours from loss, migration or oxidation during processing or storage. Class II hydrophobins are interesting microbial biosurfactants with potential for encapsulating hydrophobic molecules in aqueous environments. Their characteristics are based on their ability to form highly ordered monolayers at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces. In this study, the feasibility of Class II hydrophobins as fixation agents were studied in order to extend the presence of hop compounds such as ocimene and myrcene in solution with the purpose of stabilizing volatile flavour compounds. Class II hydrophobins of high purity were produced using Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography (RP-LC). Identification of hydrophobins was performed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF). As hop compounds, ocimene (assay ≥ 90 %, Sigma-Aldrich) and myrcene (technical grade, Sigma-Aldrich) were investigated. Using Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID), it was possible to quantify the hop components which remained in solution. By Modified Carlsberg Test (MCT), the quantity of hop compounds that interacted with the hydrophobins, was determined. The droplet size of the complexes formed in liquid samples was measured using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Nano-flex 180 ·, Microtrac, Germany). The quantification of hop compounds was performed at different hours in order to know the rate of evaporation of those compounds in the presence and absence of class II hydrophobins. It was observed that when 0. 12 mg/ml - 1 of pure HFBII was present in an ocimene solution of 0. 04 mg/ml- 1 contained in an open flask, after 3 days, 37. 5 % of the ocimene dispersed was still present in comparison with the samples without HFBII where any ocimene remained. Using Modified Carlsberg Test, the quantity of hop compounds able to interact with the hydrophobic patch of three different types of class II hydrophobins, namely HFBI and HFBII from Trichoderma Reesei and HFB- 2 a 2 from Trichoderma Harzianum was determined, finding that 10 µl/L of ocimene is sufficient to interact with 0. 2 mg/L- 1 of HFBI, HFBII and HFB- 2 a 2 in presence of CO 2. The results clearly demonstrate that the presence of class II hydrophobins in solutions that contain apolar molecules, such as the hop compounds used in this study, promotes the interaction of those compounds with the hydrophobic patch of the proteins, giving as a result new complexes that postpone the release of those volatile molecules to the gas phase. The use of class II hydrophobins as a <b>flavour</b> <b>carrier</b> in aqueous solutions can be an important alternative to maintain flavour and aroma in beverages. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to study `functionalised' calcium carbonates (FCCs) {{for use as a}} carrier for the {{controlled}} release of `actives,' by permeation and diffusion, and is being proposed as an environmentally friendly and non-toxic pharmaceutical excipient, nutraceutical, and <b>flavour</b> <b>carrier.</b> The delivery of a drug to its target site in the appropriate amount and time-frame in order for it to have a controlled release effect whilst achieving the maximum therapeutic effect remains a topic of design and development for novel drug delivery systems. FCCs encompass a family of new pharmaceutical excipients in which the conditions of manufacture follow strict process regulations with respect to the grade of reagents that are employed and the microbiological environment under which they are produced, and include freedom from organic polymers. Adjustments to the FCC production process can be used to produce a wide range of different morphologies, and raise the possibility of tailoring the void structures of the particles to provide controlled release delivery vehicles for actives across many fields, including drugs and flavours. However, such tailoring can only be fully optimised by a fundamental characterisation {{of the way in which}} a drug, loaded into an FCC, then flows and diffuses out over a period of time to provide the delayed release. It was found that adsorption on the FCC surface is selective, for example, saccharin does not become adsorbed from 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) piperazine- 1 -ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer solution, and neither does anethole from ethanol. FCC also does not adsorb the cationic probe benzyltrimethylammonium bromide (BTMAB) or the anionic probe sodium 2 -naphthalenesulphonate (Na 2 NS). However, it was found that vanillin adsorbs onto the FCC in an amount of 2. 00 ± 0. 59 mg g^- 1. Aspirin and vanillin adsorption from ethanolic solutions with various additions of water onto FCC TP was investigated and fitted with the Tóth isotherm. It was estimated that vanillin adsorbed onto around 17 %, and aspirin onto around 39 %, of the overall FCC TP surface area without the addition of any water. An equation was formulated in order to approximate the adsorption as a function of the FCC's surface coverage by the water. This is discussed in Chapter 4 and has also been published in a peer-reviewed academic journal (Levy et al., 2017). Chapter 5 discusses the preliminary steps of the loading of vanillin and saccharin into FCC, and the results were inconclusive for a majority of samples, concluding that the loading and analysis methods need refining. The modelling of the diffusion profiles of vanillin loaded FCC S 07 and S 10 was successful, and resulted in diffusion coefficients of 231. 9 x 10 ^- 16 m^ 2 s^- 1 and 248. 44 x 10 ^- 16 m^ s^- 1, respectively. This is outlined in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 describes the `zero length column' (ZLC) technique, which was used as a way to characterise the diffusivity of the intraparticle pores of each FCC grade. However, it was established that there are many experimental artefacts present with such a method. This work outlines the development of the novel `finite length column' (FLC), which was developed as a means to overcome the limitations of the ZLC (Levy et al., 2015). Effective diffusivity coefficients in the long-term region of the diffusion curves of the FCC samples range from 1. 06 - 106 x 10 ^- 16 m ^ 2 s^- 1. The FLC was then used in preliminary trials to dilute FCC with an inert solid in order to further refine the ZLC technique, and is discussed in Chapter 8. Two mathematical methods were also developed to aid in the refinement. The reported effective diffusivity coefficient for FCC 03 in the long-term region of the diffusion curve is 49. 5 x 10 ^- 16 m^ 2 s^- 1. In conclusion, this work confirms that FCC has potential for use as a carrier for the controlled release of `actives' by diffusion. The utilisation of mathematical modelling in conjunction with experimental methods in the study of drug release and delivery is steadily increasing due to its enormous future potential; it will enable the optimisation of novel dosage forms and the elucidation of release mechanisms at a major reduction in cost and time compared with the number of experimental studies required to do so...|$|E

40|$|Insects {{are highly}} valued as food in many {{cultures}} but {{have only recently}} gained interest in the West as a sustainable alternative to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} meat production. Despite the growing consumer interest in insect consumption, there is still a great disparity between curious trying and actual acceptance. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how the product preparation, familiarity and individual traits (e. g. food neophobia) influence the consumer acceptance of insects as food. Dutch consumers (n = 976) evaluated 8 mealworm product images on 4 acceptability measures (product appropriateness, expected sensory-liking, willingness to buy, willingness to try). Product images varied according to mealworm visibility (visible/invisible), <b>carrier</b> <b>flavour</b> (savoury/sweet) and <b>carrier</b> origin (Western/Asian). High product acceptability was not simply achieved by adding mealworms to familiar foods. Acceptability depended very much on the perceived appropriateness of mealworms as food and the perceived appropriateness of the product combination. However, mealworm products were always expected to be inferior to the carrier products, even when visually identical. Familiarity with mealworms and individual traits played a relatively minor role, and influenced the willingness to try more than the other acceptability measures. We conclude that appropriate product design is important but insufficient to achieve consumer acceptance of insects as food in the West. Additional incentives are required to encourage acceptance beyond the mere willingness to try. We discuss the complexities underlying the consumer acceptance of insects as food and reflect on how acceptance might be increased in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{review the}} {{available}} evidence evaluating the chemicals in refill solutions, cartridges, aerosols and environmental emissions of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted to identify research related to e-cigarettes and chemistry using 5 reference databases and 11 search terms. The search date range was January 2007 to September 2013. The search yielded 36 articles, of which 29 were deemed relevant for analysis. Results The levels of nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), aldehydes, metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), <b>flavours,</b> solvent <b>carriers</b> and tobacco alkaloids in e-cigarette refill solutions, cartridges, aerosols and environmental emissions vary considerably. The delivery of nicotine {{and the release of}} TSNAs, aldehydes and metals are not consistent across products. Furthermore, the nicotine level listed on the labels of e-cigarette cartridges and refill solutions is often significantly different from measured values. Phenolic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and drugs have also been reported in e-cigarette refill solutions, cartridges and aerosols. Varying results in particle size distributions of particular matter emissions from e-cigarettes across studies have been observed. Methods applied for the generation and chemical analyses of aerosols differ across studies. Performance characteristics of e-cigarette devices also vary across and within brands. Conclusions Additional studies based on knowledge of e-cigarette user behaviours and scientifically validated aerosol generation and chemical analysis methods would be helpful in generating reliable measures of chemical quantities. This would allow comparisons of e-cigarette aerosol and traditional smoke constituent levels and would inform an evaluation of the toxicity potential of e-cigarettes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractE-liquids {{generally}} contain {{four main}} components: nicotine, <b>flavours,</b> water and <b>carrier</b> liquids. The <b>carrier</b> liquid dissolves <b>flavours</b> and nicotine and vaporises {{at a certain}} temperature on the atomizer of the e-cigarette. Propylene glycol and glycerol, the principal carriers used in e-liquids, undergo decomposition {{in contact with the}} atomizer heating-coil forming volatile carbonyls. Some of these, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, are of concern due to their adverse impact on human health when inhaled at sufficient concentrations. The aim {{of this study was to}} correlate the yield of volatile carbonyls emitted by e-cigarettes with the temperature of the heating coil. For this purpose, a popular commercial e-liquid was machine-vaped on a third generation e-cigarette which allowed the variation of the output wattage (5 – 25 W) and therefore the heat generated on the atomizer heating-coil. The temperature of the heating-coil was determined by infrared thermography and the vapour generated at each temperature underwent subjective sensorial quality evaluation by an experienced vaper. A steep increase in the generated carbonyls was observed when applying a battery-output of at least 15 W corresponding to 200 – 250 °C on the heating coil. However, when considering concentrations in each inhaled puff, the short-term indoor air guideline value for formaldehyde was already exceeded at the lowest wattage of 5 W, which is the wattage applied in most 2 nd generation e-cigarettes. Concentrations of acetaldehyde in each puff were several times below the short-term irritation threshold value for humans. Acrolein was only detected from 20 W upwards. The negative sensorial quality evaluation by the volunteering vaper of the vapour generated at 20 W demonstrated the unlikelihood that such a wattage would be realistically set by a vaper. This study highlights the importance to develop standardised testing methods for the assessment of carbonyl-emissions and emissions of other potentially harmful compounds from e-cigarettes. The wide variety and variability of products available on the market make the development of such methods and the associated standardised testing conditions particularly demanding...|$|R
