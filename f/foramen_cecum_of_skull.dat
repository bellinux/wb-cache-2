30|$|During embryogenesis, the bi-lobed thyroid migrates inferiorly {{from the}} <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum</b> <b>of</b> the tongue {{to the lower}} neck. Initially, the thyroid {{primordium}} passes anterior to the primordial hyoid bone, before it loops posteriorly and inferiorly to the hyoid bone. Then it continues its descent into the infra-hyoid portion of the neck, anterior to the trachea, thyroid cartilage, and thyroid membrane. Any thyroid residual along the descent course {{may lead to the}} development of ectopic thyroid glands. Thyroid carcinomas, thyroiditis, and goiter may develop within any ectopic thyroid tissue [1, 45 – 47].|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum</b> <b>of</b> the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|R
5000|$|An ectopic thyroid, {{also called}} {{accessory}} thyroid gland, {{is a form}} of thyroid dysgenesis in which an entire or parts of the thyroid located {{in another part of the}} body than what is the usual case. A completely ectopic thyroid gland may be located anywhere along the path of the descent of the thyroid during its embryological development, although it is most commonly located at the base of the tongue, just posterior to the <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. In this location, an aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland is known as a lingual thyroid. [...] If the thyroid fails to descend to even higher degree, then the resulting final resting point of the thyroid gland may be high in the neck, such as just below the hyoid bone. Parts of ectopic thyroid tissue ("accessory thyroid tissue") can also occur, and arises from remnants of the thyroglossal duct, and may appear anywhere along its original length. Accessory thyroid tissue may be functional, but is generally insufficient for normal function if the main thyroid gland is entirely removed.|$|R

40|$|A case of {{accessory}} thyroid in {{the anterior}} mediastinum, physically {{separated from the}} thy roid gland, is reported. The mediastinal thyroid was incidentally discovered during the preopera tive evaluation of a patient with breast carci noma. The extreme rarity of the case is out lined. continuity with structures in the neck. Biopsy of the mass showed normal thyroid tissue. DISCUSSION Mass lesions of the mediastinum discovered by a routine chest radiograph present a serious diagnostic Embryologically the human thyroid originates from an anlÃ¤geof the pharyngeal epithelium in the region <b>of</b> the <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. The an lÃ¤gemigrates in the neck, anterior to the first tra chea! ring. Thyroid tissue may arrest at any level during this progression, giving rise to a lingual, supra-hyoid, or infrahyoid thyroid gland. Infrequently the entire gland or part of it may descend into the chest (/). Usually, these intrathoracic remnants are small in size and their function is irrelevant. CASE REPORT A 59 -year-old woman was admitted with a lump in the right breast. At the inferior pole of the right lobe of the thyroid a 1 -cm soft nodule was palpated. Mammography and thermography confirmed a ma lignant lesion of the right breast. Bone survey and brain and liver scans were negative for metastatic lesions. Chest radiography (Fig. 1) revealed a round regular 8 -cm opacity in the anterior mediastinum. Fluoroscopy and serial tomograms gave no further information about the mass. Thyroid scan with ml showed an enlarged left lobe, a small cold nodule on the right lobe, and a concentration of radioactivity in the anterior mediastinum (Fig. 2) physically sepa rated from the normal gland. The scintigraphic mass correlated with that seen on the roentgenograph. The 131 Iuptake and serum T 3 and T, were normal. Needle biopsy of the cold nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid showed colloid-cystic degeneration.

50|$|The thyroid {{appears as}} an {{epithelial}} proliferation in the pharynx floor between the copula linguae and the tuberculum impar. This point later {{will be the}} <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum.</b> Later, the thyroid descends {{in front of the}} pharyngeal gut when it already has a belobed diverticulum shape. The thyroglossal duct keeps the thyroid joined to the tongue until it disappears. The thyroid keeps descending in front of the hyoid bone until finally it affixes {{to the front of the}} trachea in the seventh week. The thyroid starts working in the third month when the first follicles are visible and start producing colloid. The parafollicular cells come from the ultimobranchial body and produce calcitonin.|$|R
50|$|The tongue {{develops}} {{after the}} thyroid primordium so the <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum</b> becomes buried {{at the base}} of the tongue. The thyroglossal duct then continues through the neck and lies anterior to the laryngeal cartilage. The duct then passes anteriorly to the developing hyoid bone; however, as the bone continues to grow it can continue to grow posteriorly, become anterior, or even grow to surround the duct. The duct is found very close to the medial line of the neck. The duct continues in front of the thyrohyoid membrane, sternothyroid muscle, and sternohyoid muscle, before terminating in the inferior segment of the neck at the thyroid.|$|R
5000|$|Studies done on cadavers claim {{persistent}} thyroglossal ducts can {{be completely}} asymptomatic and found in 7% {{of the human}} adult population. However, the continued presence of the duct can often lead to complications due to infections and fluid buildup. The glands in the mucosa of the duct will continue their secretions until the fluid forms a cyst or exit the duct via the opening in the <b>foramen</b> <b>cecum.</b> Local infections, such as colds, tonsillitis, or inflammation of the lymph nodes in the area {{can also lead to}} the accumulation of fluid within the duct.
