Secretary of Education Ron Tomalis announced that 104 K-12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units, signed-up {{to participate in the}} new teacher and principal evaluation pilot program. The initiative is funded by a Gates Momentum grant. During the 2011-12 school year, more than 120 school districts, charter schools, intermediate units, and career and technology centers participated in the second <b>implementation</b> <b>phase</b> of the new teacher evaluation tool. This included more than 650 supervisors and nearly 5,000 teachers in 366 school buildings participating in the pilot project.|$|E

50|$|The {{power of}} DSDM {{is that the}} method uses the {{principles}} of iteration and incremental value, meaning that projects are carried out in repeating phases where each phase adds value to the project. In this way <b>implementation</b> <b>phases</b> {{can be carried out}} incrementally and add value to important project aspects such as the degree of acceptance, awareness and skills within every increment Von Meyenfeldt, Basiskennis project management, Academic Service 1999.In addition to the management of chance scope, increments are also usable in the process modeling scope of <b>implementation</b> <b>phases.</b> Using increments can align process models of business architectures and product software as adding more detail in every increment of the phase draws both models closer.The DSDM also has room for phased training, documentation and reviewing.|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{dispersal}} of flying units {{was not a}} problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. [...] This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. [...] To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. [...] This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its <b>implementation</b> <b>phase,</b> another partial mobilization, which included the 349th Wing and its flying squadrons, occurred for the Cuban missile crisis. [...] Only four hours after the first call to report for duty was made, 95 percent of the wing's flying personnel had checked in and were ready to move. [...] In addition to its four squadrons, the 733d Troop Carrier Squadron was also activated and assigned to the wing during this mobilization. [...] During the mobilization, they served for one month to airlift troops and supplies to the buildup of military forces in the south Florida area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: UNITE is an {{e-learning}} {{research project}} (partially {{funded by the}} EU, under FP 6), where a number of e-learning scenarios have been developed, covering different educational contexts, pedagogical concepts and subjects (e. g. Environmental Studies, Mathematics, Information and Communication Technologies, and many other), bridging thus the gap between formal and informal learning settings. The various scenarios have been designed by secondary school teachers (with {{the help of the}} project’s domain experts) baring in mind the corresponding diverse cultural and educational backgrounds of the school environments they would be implemented in. All scenarios were supported by relevant electronic resources, material, or in other words content that was either developed from scratch, or adapted from existing sample resources. There were two consecutive e-learning scenario <b>implementation</b> <b>phases</b> in the project. After both <b>implementation</b> <b>phases,</b> the teachers were asked to complete questionnaires in order to capture facts {{on the one hand and}} their personal beliefs on the other. Therefore, this paper constitutes a study of the entire content development process within the course of UNITE, presents a summary of the guidelines that were given to the participating teachers and examines the results of the process separately in the two scenario <b>implementation</b> <b>phases,</b> comparing the two, presenting findings and drawing conclusions. Special emphasis is placed on the factors that might have influenced the teacher’s performance in content development...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} theorizes employee grumbling as a {{user resistance}} phenomenon observed during early information system (IS) <b>implementation</b> <b>phases.</b> When {{the usage of}} new IS is mandatory, user resistance cannot be observed when focusing technology usage, instead, employees protest against the IS implementation, or spoke rather negatively of it. This form of user resistance behavior is conceptualized by the newly proposed variable employee grumbling, which {{provides a different perspective}} on user resistance that can be used especially in early <b>implementation</b> <b>phases</b> to observe resistance behaviors. Perceived ease of use and usefulness, affective and cognitive resistance to change, and individual differences and basic tendencies are analyzed as antecedents based on study with 106 employees during an IS implementation. The results of the analysis reveal that especially affective resistance to change determine employee grumbling, and technology perceptions are less important in early implementation...|$|R
