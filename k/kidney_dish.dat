5000|$|Generally, {{the volume}} of a pulp <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> (or [...] "vomit dish") is 700 ml. Its length is 25 cm-26 cm, its width 11 cm. Each year more than 100 million pulp kidney dishes are used in {{hospital}} or family care.|$|E
50|$|A <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> (British English) or emesis basin (American English) is {{a shallow}} basin with a {{kidney-shaped}} footprint and sloping walls (hence its alternate name) used in medical and surgical wards to receive soiled dressings {{and other medical}} waste. Reusable kidney dishes are usually made of stainless steel, while disposable ones may be made of paper pulp or plastic. The shape of the dish allows it to be held against the patient's body to catch any falling fluids or debris.Various sizes of emesis basin are a common sight in healthcare settings, including facilities such as nursing homes that may have bedridden patients. The disposable version of the <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> was invented by Bessie Virginia Blount.|$|E

According to a 1997 UNICEF delegation, hospitals were clean but wards were devoid {{of even the most}} rudimentary supplies and equipment; sphygmomanometers, thermometers, scales, <b>kidney</b> <b>dishes,</b> spatulas, IV giving sets, etc. The mission saw numerous patients being treated with home made beer bottle IV sets, clearly unsterile. There was an absence of ORS (oral rehydration solution) and even the most basic drugs such as analgesics and antibiotics.|$|R
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of intravenous oxytocin 10 IU and oral misoprostol tablet 600 ug {{in the prevention of}} PPH. A randomised approach was used to recruit 1800 consenting pregnant women whom were randomly allocated at term to two medication groups of 10 IU oxytocin intravenously at delivery of the anterior shoulder and oral misoprostol group; 600 μg (3 x 200 μg) tablets within three minutes of the delivery of baby. Blood loss by each patient was collected using precalibrated <b>kidney</b> <b>dishes.</b> Haemoglobin level was measured at term and 24 h after delivery. The study indicated higher occurrences of PPH (17. 9 VS 8. 9 %) and higher MBL (388. 04 ± 5. 910 ml VS 327. 68 ± 3. 953 ml) in the oxytocin medication group. Drop in the mean haemoglobin levels in the oxytocin group (0. 708 ± 0. 0340) was significantly (p < 0. 001) higher than in the misoprostol group (0. 549 ± 0. 0276). The proportion of enrolees that needed additional oxytocic agents was significantly (ρ < 0. 05) higher in the oxytocin group (16. 4 %) than in the misoprostol group (3. 6 %). None of the enrolees in either of the two medication groups had indication for blood transfusion. In Maiduguri metropolis, oral misoprostol tablet 600 μg has demonstrated better prevention of PPH than intravenous oxytocin 10 IU. The two medication approaches are safe and could be inter changed if need arises...|$|R

They clearly like each other, but are too shy to admit it. Bernie urges Oliver to admit how he really feels about her. Bernie's manager Ginger (Michael Medwin) comes to visit him and tells him that he must try {{to be more of}} a showman and not simply go for broke with every match. Nurse Dawson comes in early to sterilise some rubber catheters, but is interrupted by the demanding Colonel. The catheters are put in a <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> to boil on the stove. Oliver is furious when the ward has to be cleared and tidied up for Matron's rounds as it upsets his schedule for no obvious purpose.

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{wound healing}} {{has been a}} problem which causes high {{mortality}} in the developing world; postoperative wound has been reported to cause devastating consequences and a measurable mortality. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess nursing practice on postoperative wound care in surgical wards at Muhimbili National Hospital. Methodology: A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. Data was collected using a checklist from a convenient sample of 71 nurses in surgical wards at Muhimbili National Hospital. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and permission to conduct the study was granted by Muhimbili National Hospital. Data was analyzed using SPSS program version 19. Results were summarized using frequencies, percentages, and presented using figures, tables and text. Results The result shows that majority of the participants were female 76. 5 % and 40. 8 % of the participants aged 25 – 34 years. More than half of the participants were observed to have poor post operative wound care practice 57. 7 %. Male participants scored higher, and had better practice compared to female however there was no significant difference between the scores (P= 0. 803). In the preparation phase, hand washing before and after the procedure was observed by less than half of the participants 49. 3 %. None of the participants ensured cleanliness of the environment and patient’s privacy by screening or closing the room. The study findings revealed that nurses use clean gloves when removing the old dressing 99 %, while use of sterile gloves during wound dressing was not observed by 63 % of participants. Good practice was observed in applying dressing solution as prescribed 85 % participants, dry sterile dressing applied 90 %, arrangement of dressing forceps and other items by order to their application using forceps 20 %, usage of forceps to dip gauze into antiseptic solution 35 % and cleaning of the wound from least contaminated to most contaminated area 34 %. Post-operative counseling and instructing the patient not to temper with the wound was done by only 15 % of the participants. None of the participant documented wound changes, reported patient comfort, and recorded date or time after the procedure. Conclusion Majority of the participants in surgical wards do not follow the postoperative wound care checklist provided by MNH although they know its importance. Assessment of the wound and documentation continues to be a problem in the nursing profession. Participants were reasonably knowledgeable about the principal of wound dressing; however lack of knowledge on some of the key principles of wound dressing is worth noting. Almost half of the participants did not wash hands before and after the procedures, they did not use single gauze in one direction only, nor cleaned from least contaminated to most contaminated area, which can lead to wound contamination. Recommendation Ministry of health and social welfare should ensure that nurses are more trained at least to undergraduate level of nursing education. This can be achieved by providing more learning opportunities to nurses accompanied by sponsorships from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and sophisticated access to loan from Higher Education Loan Board (HELBS) Muhimbili National Hospital should recruits adequate number of nurses to cope with workload and number of patients. Adequate number of nurses will enable nurses to have more time to prepare equipments and to assess, plan, implement and evaluate care of patients with wound. Ministry of health and social welfare should also ensure that nurses caring for patients with wounds have refresher course to update them on issues of personal and patient protection from infection through infection control and prevention seminars. Increase economic power of the MNH to purchase items to ensure adequate supply of dressing materials including dressing packs, toothed forceps, cotton swabs, gauze, <b>kidney</b> <b>dishes,</b> dressing towels, artery forceps, eusol solution and Hydrogen peroxide solution, normal saline and Spirit...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although nursing {{students}} are {{at greater risk}} for needlestick injuries (NSIs) and sharps injuries (SIs) than staff nurses, {{there is a lack of}} research on NSIs and SIs in students, especially in different years of study. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for and prevalence of NSIs and SIs among nursing students in different years of study. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey study using a questionnaire confirmed to be valid and reliable, with a content validity index of 0. 96 and reliability index of 0. 82. Results: A total of 878 nursing students (response rate, 76. 61 %), participated in the study. NSIs/SIs, NSIs, and SIs were significantly increased by year of study (P <. 001) in both the study period and 12 -month prevalence. Four predictors for NSIs/SIs were final-year study (odds ratio [OR], 11. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 9 - 36. 7), perception of not receiving prevention training (OR, 2. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 7. 5), perception of not using a <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> to contain used needles and sharps (OR, 4. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 7 - 10. 3), and perception of not immediately discarding used needles and syringes into a sharps box (OR, 2. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 7. 4). Conclusions: Preclinical training, reinforcement of <b>kidney</b> <b>dish</b> use, immediate discarding of used needles, and adequate clinical supervision are essential elements in reducing the risk of NSIs and SIs.

40|$|Background: Research {{has shown}} that nursing {{personnel}} {{are exposed to the}} serious risk of contracting bloodborne diseases from needlestick and sharps injuries (NSIs). Only a few studies have examined the problem among nursing students. In Hong Kong, there is an equal lack of research in this area. Methods: A review of accident reports in one university was employed to determine the injury rate, causation, and epidemiological profile of NSIs. Descriptive statistics, prevalence, incidence density, cumulative incidence, and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the data. Results: From January 2002 to December 2006, there were a total of 51 reported cases of NSIs (43 needlestick injuries and 8 sharps injuries). The annual prevalence of NSIs in four academic years from 2002 - 2003 to 2005 - 2006 ranged from 0. 6 to 1. 6 cases while the incidence rate was one new case per 100 nursing students per academic year. The cumulative incidence of NSIs for year-one, year-two and year-three students were 0, 0. 03 and 0. 004 respectively. The majority of needlestick injuries (n- 25; 58. 14 %) were from contaminated needles. Procedures involved in the needlestick injuries were giving injection (n = 22; 51. 16 %), collecting urine specimen (n= 5; 11. 63 %), removal of urinary catheter (n= 4; 9. 30 %), and checking blood glucose usingglucometer(n= 3; 6. 98 %). Giving injection (n= 5; 62. 50 %) also accounted for the highest percentage of sharps injuries. Specific activities that were identified were opening the needle cap, opening ampoules, inserting the needle and mixing dirty and clean material in one <b>kidney</b> <b>dish.</b> Conclusions: Results showed that nursing students are at high risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens because of NSIs. A hierarchy control involving engineering, administrative and personal behavioral activities is recommended to reduce the occurrence of NSIs among nursing students. School of Nursin...|$|E
