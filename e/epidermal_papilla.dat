40|$|AbstractThe surface {{architecture}} of the buccal cavity of the omnivorous fish Clarias gariepinus was studied in relation to its food and feeding habits. The buccal cavity of the present fish was investigated {{by means of a}} scanning electron microscope. This cavity may be distinguished into the roof and the floor. Papilliform and molariform teeth which are located in the buccal cavity are associated with seizing, grasping, holding of the prey, crushing and grinding of various food items. Three types of taste buds (Types I, II & III) were found at different levels in the buccal cavity. Type I taste buds were found in relatively high <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae.</b> Type II taste buds were mostly found in low <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae.</b> Type III taste buds never raise above the normal level of the epithelium. These types may be useful for ensuring full utilization of the gustatory ability of the fish. A firm consistency or rigidity of the free surface of the epithelial cells may be attributed to compactly arranged microridges. These structures protect against physical abrasions potentially caused during food maneuvering and swallowing. Furthermore, protection of the epithelium from abrasion is enhanced with mucous cell secretions which lubricate ingested food items...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{new species}} have been {{proposed}} in the following genera: Gluta (5), Swintonia (1), and Melanochyla to- Seventeen new combinations {{have been made in}} the following genera: Gluta (11), Melanochyla (3), Semecarpus (1), Drimycarpus (1), and Nothopegia (1). Abaxial <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> of leaves occur in seven genera. Their patterns (as observed under low magnification), which can be used sometimes as diagnostic characters, are grouped and representative species listed. The genus Drimycarpus is newly recorded for the flora of Malesia. The generic delimitation of Gluta and Melanorrhoea has been reviewed, and reasons are given why the latter is merged with the former. Coalescent cotyledons, recorded until now only for Gluta renghas, have been found occurring also in other species of the genus Gluta. An Indian species described as Ficus (Moraceae), suggested to be an Anacardiaceous plant, belongs to Nothopegia (extra-Malesian genus). A historical review and typification for the subdivisions of Mangifera have been made; two sections of this genus have been accepted and their representatives listed.

40|$|The leaf {{anatomy of}} Kokoona and Lophopetalum is {{described}} in detail. Separation of the two genera as effectuated by Hou (1963) is supported by differences in vascular anatomy of the distal end of the petiole, which is invariably more complex in Lophopetalum than in Kokoona. Other differential characters (p. ooo) only apply to part of the species of Lophopetalum. As based on leaf anatomy {{it is impossible to}} define groups of closely related species within the genera {{because of a lack of}} mutual correlation between the different leaf anatomical characters. Lophopetalum in particular shows some striking anatomical features such as a very variable and complex arrangement of vascular tissue in petiole and midrib, complex types of cyclocytic and anisocytic stomata, crystarque cells, and <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae.</b> Most of these characters occur in part of the genus only. The variability below the species level of characters such as epidermal wall thickness, number of subsidiary cells per stoma, dimension of guard cell pairs, presence or absence of stomata in upper epidermis etc. is reported for some species. Because of the great range of anatomical variation it is impossible to identify species, using leaf anatomical characters only...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} microprobe (EMP) {{analysis of}} silica (SiO 2) deposition in the epidermis of developing internodes of the perennial scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale var. affine) indicates that SiO 2 is first {{detected in the}} stomatal apparatus beginning with internode 3, then the <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> (internode 8), and finally in radial cell walls of the long epidermal cells (internode 10). This process is initiated in the intercalary growth regions at the bases of the elongating internodes. The deposition of SiO 2 in long epidermal cell walls occurs after internodal extension has ceased and should therefore be considered {{as one of the}} final stages in internodal differentiation that involves strengthening the cellulosic framework of the cell wall. EMP measurements indicate that SiO 2 in stomata is equivalent to 30 % of a pure SiO 2 standard and that SiO 2 in the radial walls of long epidermal cells averages twice that measured on the tangential walls of these same cells. This study supports the view that silicification {{plays a major role in}} strengthening the developing perennial scouring rush internodal system and that regulation of this process in this and other species of Equisetum, whose SiO 2 deposition patterns are markedly different, deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDetermining the {{authenticity}} {{and quality of}} plant raw materials used {{in the formulation of}} herbal medicines, teas and cosmetics is essential to ensure their safety and efficacy for clinical use. Some Passiflora species are officially recognized in the pharmaceutical compendia of various countries and have therapeutic uses, particularly as sedatives and anxiolytics. However, the large number of Passiflora species, coupled with the fact that most species are popularly known as passion fruit, increases the misidentification problem. The {{purpose of this study is}} to make a pharmacognostic comparison between various Passiflora species to establish a morpho-anatomical profile that could contribute to the quality control of herbal drug products that contain passion fruit. This was conducted by collecting samples of leaves from twelve Passiflora taxa (ten species and two forms of P. edulis) : P. actinia, P. alata, P. amethystina, P. capsularis, P. cincinnata, P. edulis f. flavicarpa, P. edulis f. edulis, P. incarnata, P. morifolia, P. urnifolia, P. coccinea and P. setacea, from different locations and their morpho-anatomical features were analyzed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Microscopic analysis allowed to indicate a set of characters that can help to differentiate species. These include midrib and petiole shape, midrib and petiole vascular pattern, medium vein shape, presence of trichomes, presence of blade <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> and sclerenchymatic cells adjoining the vascular bundles. These characters could be used to assist in the determination of herbal drug quality and authenticity derived from a species of Passiflora...|$|R
40|$|Floral nectar spurs {{are widely}} {{considered}} to influence pollinator behaviour in orchids. Spurs of 21 orchid species selected from within four molecularly circumscribed clades of subtribe Orchidinae (based on Platanthera s. l., Gymnadenia-Dactylorhiza s. l., Anacamptis s. l., Orchis s. s.) were examined under light and {{scanning electron microscopes}} in order to estimate correlations between nectar production (categorized as absent, trace, reservoir), interior <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> (categorized as absent, short, medium, long) and epidermal cell striations (categorized as apparently absent, weak, moderate, strong). Closely related congeneric species scored similarly, but more divergent species showed less evidence of phylogenetic constraints. Nectar secretion was negatively correlated with striations and positively correlated with papillae, which were especially frequent and large in species producing substantial reservoirs of nectar. We speculate that the primary function of the papillae is conserving energy through nectar resorption and explain the presence of large papillae in a minority of deceit-pollinated species by arguing that the papillae improve pollination because they are a tactile expectation of pollinating insects. In contrast, the prominence of striations may be a 'spandrel', simply reflecting {{the thickness of the}} overlying cuticle. Developmentally, the spur is an invagination of the labellum; it is primarily vascularized by a single 'U'-shaped primary strand, with smaller strands present in some species. Several suggestions are made for developing further, more targeted research programmes. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 160, 369 - 387...|$|R
40|$|Pandanus amaryllifolius, is {{the best}} {{available}} natural source of principal basmati aroma compound 2 acetyl- 1 -pyrroline (2 AP) and hence used widely to flavour various food dishes in south-east Asian countries. In this species, lower <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> {{have been identified as}} a site of 2 AP storage and its detailed SEM study has been carried out. Populations of P. amaryllifolius were collected from 37 localities of East and West coast of India, analyzed for 2 AP and other aroma volatiles using head space solid phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) coupled with GC-MS/GC-FID and an elite population containing 12. 24 ppm 2 AP has been identified from Palghar locality of Maharashtra. Genetic diversity of collected populations was assessed using ISSR and AFLP markers. The study revealed less than 3 % genetic variability confirming that the species has very low level of genetic variation and the genome is highly conserved. In order to address the high level of 2 AP expression, it was further attempted to characterize BADH 2 enzyme from leaves of P. amaryllifolius. BADH enzyme activity was found to be 0. 169 micro mol/min in P. amaryllifolius. Partial cDNA based sequence of BADH gene was obtained that showed more than 85 % homology with the rice BADH 2. By southern blot analysis two BADH isoforms were also detected. Thus, the study suggests similar kind of 2 AP synthesis mechanism, as found in scented rice, might exist in P. amaryllifolius. Further studies in this species are being made to reveal the mechanism of high levels of 2 AP biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structural}} {{organization of}} the epidermis, dermal/epidermal junction, and dermis from an unexposed site (upper inner arm) of elderly people was compared with the organization of a similar region of young people. Despite an overall thinning of the epidermis and focal areas of cytologic atypia, the characteristic morphological markers associated with the keratinization process are not markedly altered in appearance or amount. A well-formed stratum corneum consisting of flattened, enucleated horny cells enveloped by a thickened membrane, and intracellular spaces filled with electron-dense material provide structural evidence that barrier ability is not compromised in senile skin. The dermal/epidermal changes in aged skin are marked and have significant physiologic implications. The major change is a relatively flat dermal/epidermal junction resulting from the retraction of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> {{as well as the}} microprojections of basal cells into the dermis. This flattening results in a more fragile epidermal/dermal interface and, consequently, the epidermis is less resistant to shearing forces. Retraction of the epidermal downgrowths (preferential sites of the putative epidermal stem cell) may also explain the loss in proliferative capacity associated with the aged epidermis. The three-dimensional arrangements of collagen and elastic fibers showed marked alterations with age. Both fibrous components appear more compact because of a decrease in spaces between the fibers. Collagen bundles appear to unravel, and the individual elastic fibers show signs of elastosis. These changes may contribute to the loss of resilience {{that is one of the}} salient features of senile skin. J Invest Dermatol 88 : 44 s- 51 s, 198...|$|R
40|$|The floral and {{vegetative}} {{anatomy of}} the closely allied guttiferous genera Cratoxylum (Indo-Malesia) and Eliaea (Madagascar) is described. Although the two taxa have many features in common, differences are substantial enough to recognize them as distinct genera, as appears from the following survey: Cratoxylum Ovary with 12 or more ovules Ovary with 3 (or 4) incomplete true septa Styles and filaments glabrous Secondary xylem with scarcely pitted fibres Vessels solitary and in radial multiples Silica bodies present in ray cells of wood Eliaea Ovary with 6 (— 8) ovules Ovary with 6 (or 8) incomplete septa, three being true, three false Styles and filaments mostly villous Secondary xylem with densely pitted fibretracheids Vessels almost exclusively solitary Silica bodies absent The vascularization and insertion of the hypogynous scales in both genera favours the view that these structures may be interpreted as staminodial derivatives. In some species of Cratoxylum a further differentiation into taxa of lower rank {{is suggested by the}} presence or absence of abaxial <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> on the leaves; this is related to geographical distribution. Floral and xylem specialization of Cratoxylum and Eliaea are discussed. The xylem structure of Eliaea shows more primitive features than that of Cratoxylum, but the flowers seem to be more specialized. The possible implications of these findings for plant geography are discussed. In Cratoxylum the section Isopterygium (C. arborescens and C. glaucum) is very different in its wood anatomy from the other representatives of Cratoxylum. This difference (concerning parenchyma distribution) is correlated with the evergreen habit in the section Isopterygium. The other sections of Cratoxylum are deciduous. A comparison with some data from literature about other groups with deciduous and evergreen members is made...|$|R
40|$|The {{island of}} Rügen (Rugia), {{located in the}} Baltic sea, is the most northeastern (NE) part of Germany. Due to its {{particular}} geographic position at the border between scandinavian, middle european and continental european floral elements, Rügen harbours several hawkweed species (Hieracia) of the scandinavian area such as Hieracium fuscocinererum, H. subramosum, H. subrigidum and H. diaphanoides subsp. neoornatum and, at the same time, is the most northwestern location of H. echioides. Two endemic Hieracium species have been identified recently, i. e. H. muorum subsp. rugianum and H. caesium subsp. zabelianum (Gottschlich et al. 1998, Bot. Rundbr. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 31 : 1 - 94). In the present communication, two further novel endemic Hieracium taxa will be described, which are restricted to the chalk cliffs of Cape Arkona and Jasmund, i. e. H. swantevitii and H. lachenalii subsp. litocretaceum. H. swantevitii (Swantevit’s hawkweed) is intermediate between H. caesium/H. bifidum and H. lachenalii with hairy, modestly glandular involucre and slightly serrated elongated leaves. This view of an intermediate position of H. swantevitii between these species was further supported by the ultrastructure of <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> of the outer bracts of the involucre visualized by scanning electron microscopy. H. lachenalii subsp. litocretaceum (chalk cliff hawkweed) is characterized by its narrow anguste to almost linear denticulate leaves in combination with mode rately glandular heads. In addition to the description of these two new hawkweed taxa, the rediscovery of three further species will be reported for Rügen, i. e. H. echioides (W. Gager in SE Rügen), H. cymosum subsp. cymosum (close to Göhren in SE Rügen) and H. subrigidum E Glowe in N Rügen.

40|$|The sensorial {{function}} of the girdle of the Polyplacophora Carmen Salas 1, Antonio G. Checa 2, 3, Michael J. Vendrasco 2 1 Depto. Biología Animal, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Málaga, 29071 Málaga, Spain; 2 Departamento de Estratigrafía y Paleontología, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain, 3 Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra, CSIC-Universidad de Granada, 18100 Armilla, Spain. The polyplacophorans or chitons are characterized {{by the presence of}} eight dorsal overlapping shell plates that are embedded in a thick mantle tissue and surrounded by the girdle (also called perinotum). In chitons, the hard layers of plates consist of the uppermost tegmentum, the articulamentum whose projections form the sutural laminae and insertion plates, and the underlying hypostracum. The tegmentum, which is the visible layer of the chiton shell in life, is infiltrated with a complex, tissue-filled canal system that opens at the dorsal valve surface as sensory or secretory organs known as aesthetes. Structures secreted by the epidermis of the girdle have been mainly described as ornamentation or armature, such as numerous calcareous spines, scales, hairs or bristles, but other studies suggest that the girdle epidermis has other functions such as sensorial (Leise and Cloney, 1982; Leise, 1988). In chitons, epidermal sensory receptors have been mainly found around the mouth, on the subradular organ, in the buccal cavity, in the pallial grooves and in the shell. During a study of the formation of the cuticle in the mantle girdle of several species of chitons (Lepidozona pectinulata, Ischnochiton rissoi, Lepidochitona cinerea, Leptochiton algesirensis, Lepidopleurus cajetanus), we have observed several sensory structures in the mantle girdle. In the case of fully-grown scales and marginal spines, a group of cells differentiated from the papilla constitutes a stalked body or nodule, which progressively elevates and pushes the spine until it finally, pierces through the cuticle surface. The stalked nodules are more conspicuous in L. cinerea and L. pectinulata than in L. cajetanus. These projections arise from <b>epidermal</b> <b>papillae</b> and have been considered mechanoreceptors. Lens-like structures have been observed inside some stalked nodules in L. cinerea and L. algesirensis. The stalked nodules show dendritic structures underlying the lens-like structure, which point to a photoreception ability. The lens-like structure found in the nodule of L. cinerea seems to be a rigid, possibly mineralized structure. Aragonite lenses have been found in Acanthopleura granulata by Speiser et al. (2011). In L. algesirensis we have observed groups of long microvilli in the top margin of the papillae and in contact with the spines that we consider as mechanoreceptors. As in other chitons, dendritic processes are frequently found in association mainly with dorsal spicules, although not every spine is innervated. Universidad de Málaga.

Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology, 28 (4), 577 - 587 Tritordeum and agroticum amphiploids, derived from hybridization of Triticum species with Hordeum chilense or Agropyron cristatum, were assessed for resistance to Blumeria graminis. In glasshouse tests, all parental lines of H. chilense and A. cristatum showed complete resistance to wheat powdery mildew [Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici] while all Triticum parents, except one, were highly susceptible. The amphiploids were all resistant to B. graminis f. sp. tritici, allowing the development {{of only a few}} sporulating colonies on leaves. Microscopic examination of host-cell responses to B. graminis revealed that resistance in H. chilense and amphiploids was attributable to two major factors: (i) a significant reduction in successful fungal penetration by rapid deposition of papillae in the host epidermal cell wall and (ii) a significant increase in frequency of death of penetrated <b>epidermal</b> cells. <b>Papillae</b> formation was associated with localized autofluorescence in host epidermal cells. Cell death prevented further fungal growth and differentiation for the establishment of biotrophy.

40|$|In {{the adult}} hair {{follicle}} the dermal papilla plays {{a crucial role}} in the dermal-epidermal interactions that control hair production and events of the growth cycle. It has previously been shown that cultured cells from rat vibrissa follicle dermal papillae can stimulate hair growth when implanted into amputated follicles. This study investigated the effects of implanting low-passage cultured papilla cells into small incisional wounds in the rat ear pinna. The groups of fibers that emerged from wound sites were much larger than local hairs, and often had vibrissa-type characteristics. Later-passage papilla cells or cultured skin fibroblasts failed to elicit the same response. Histology revealed that big follicles were formed when papilla cells were trapped between the cut edges of the epidermis. Abnormally large follicles were seen at wound sites many months post-operatively. Independent of <b>epidermal</b> influence, cultured <b>papilla</b> cells in the wound dermis formed rounded papilla-like aggregates that also persisted until biopsy. A previously described method of wrapping papilla cells in glabrous epidermis was less successful in percentage terms but resulted in the production of one very large vibrissa-type follicle and fiber. These results further illustrate that the inductive powers and developmental information retained by cultured derma! papilla cells parallel the properties of their embryonic precursors; the findings may have implications for human hair growth...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{inspiration}} for the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces has come from nature, from plant such as the Sacred Lotus (Nulembo nucifera), where the micro-scale <b>papillae</b> <b>epidermal</b> cells on the surfaces of the leaves are covered with nano-scale epicuticular wax crystalloids. The combination of the surface roughness and the hydrophobic wax coating produces a superhydrophobic wetting state on the leaves allowing them to self-clean and easily shed water. Here a simple scale-up carbon nanoparticle spray coating is presented that mimics the surface of the Sacred Lotus leaves and can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} materials, complex structures, and flexible substrates, rendering them superhydrophobic, with contact angles above 160 °. The sprayable mixture is produced by combining toluene, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inherently hydrophobic rapeseed soot. The ability to spray the superhydrophobic coating allows for the hydrophobisation of complex structures such a metallic meshes, which allows for the production of flexible porous superhydrophobic materials that when formed into U-shape channels, can be used to direct flows. The porous meshes, whilst being superhydrophobic, are also oleophilic. Being both superhydrophobic and oleophilic allows oil to pass through the mesh, whilst water remains on the surface. The meshes were tested for their ability to separate mixtures of oil and water in a flow situation. When silicone oil/water mixtures were passed over the meshes, all meshes tested were capable of separating more than 93 % of the oil from the mixture...|$|R
