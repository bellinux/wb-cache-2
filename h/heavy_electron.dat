5000|$|In the 1930s special amplifying tubes were {{developed}} which deliberately [...] "folded" [...] the electron beam, by having it strike a dynode to be reflected into the anode. This {{had the effect}} of increasing the plate-grid distance for a given tube size, increasing the transconductance of the tube and reducing its noise figure. A typical such [...] "orbital beam hexode" [...] was the RCA 1630, introduced in 1939. Because the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> current in such tubes damaged the dynode surface rapidly, their lifetime tended to be very short compared to conventional tubes.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> is found theoretically in nano-structure clusters of disordered solids. The {{basis of the}} investigation is the electron band structures of disordered semiconductors previously determined by the author. The {{existence of}} electron energy pockets is found for the electrons in the conduction bands of these semiconductors that are nano-confining potential valleys of dimensions {{in the range of}} the primitive cell. The electron wave function of the confined electron is determined in when the electron interacts with local electrical field that is external for the energy pocket, and the average velocity of the electron is found. An expression for electron mass of an electron localized in pocket is derived. It is found that this electron mass is greater than the electron mass at rest and the confined <b>electrons</b> are designated <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons.</b> The possibility of interactions of protons with <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{remarkable}} experimental realizations of f-electron superlattices, e. g. CeIn_ 3 /LaIn_ 3 - and CeCoIn_ 5 /YbCoIn_ 5 - superlattices, we analyze {{the formation of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> in layered f-electron superlattices {{by means of the}} dynamical mean field theory. We show that the spectral function exhibits formation of <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> in the entire system below a temperature scale T_ 0. However, in terms of transport, two different coherence temperatures T_x and T_z are identified in the in-plane- and the out-of-plane-resistivity, respectively. Remarkably, we find T_z < T_x ∼ T_ 0 due to scatterings between different reduced Brillouin zones. The existence of these two distinct energy scales implies a crossover in the dimensionality of the <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> between two and three dimensions as temperature or layer geometry is tuned. This dimensional crossover would be responsible for the characteristic behaviors in the magnetic and superconducting properties observed in the experiments. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

50|$|Cosmic rays were {{discovered}} in 1912 by Victor Hess. He measured a difference in ionisation at different heights (using the Eiffel tower and a Hess-manned hot air balloon), {{an indication of the}} atmospheric thinning (so spreading) of a single ray. Influence of the Sun was ruled out by measuring during an eclipse. Many scientists researched the phenomenon, sometimes independently, and in 1937 Pierre Auger could conclude in detail that it was a single ray that interacted with air nuclei, causing an electron and photon air shower. At the same time, the third particle muon was discovered (behaving like a very <b>heavy</b> <b>electron).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of particles appearing in any {{quantum field theory}} are unstable, and they decay into other particles {{in a variety of}} reactions that must satisfy various conservation laws. Stable particles are stable because there are no lighter particles into which they can decay and still satisfy the conservation laws. For instance, the electron has a lepton number of one and an electric charge of one, and there are no lighter particles that conserve these values. On the other hand, the muon, essentially a <b>heavy</b> <b>electron,</b> can decay into the electron plus two quanta of energy, and hence it is not stable.|$|E
50|$|His current {{research}} concerns {{the search for}} the organizing principles responsible for emergent behavior in materials where unexpectedly new classes of behavior emerge in response to the strong and competing interactions among their elementary constituents. Some recent research results on correlated electron materials are the development of a consistent phenomenological description of protected magnetic behavior in the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprate superconductors and the discovery of the protected emergence of itinerancy in the Kondo lattice in <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> materials and its description using a two-fluid model.

40|$|Low energy nuclear {{reactions}} {{in the neighborhood}} of metallic hydride surfaces may be induced by ultra-low momentum neutrons. <b>Heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> are absorbed by protons or deuterons producing ultra low momentum neutrons and neutrinos. The required electron mass renormalization is provided by the interaction between surface electron plasma oscillations and surface proton oscillations. The resulting neutron catalyzed low energy nuclear reactions emit copious prompt gamma radiation. The <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> which induce the initially produced neutrons also strongly absorb the prompt nuclear gamma radiation, re-emitting soft photons. Nuclear hard photon radiation away from the metallic hydride surfaces is thereby strongly suppressed. Comment: ReVTeX format 6 pages no figure...|$|R

50|$|Frank Steglich {{discovered}} the first heavy fermion superconductor, CeCu2Si2, {{while working as}} a research associatein Cologne, Germany in 1979. CeCu2Si2 is the first metallic system to be discovered in which the superconductivity is drivenby electron-electron interactions, rather than the electron-phonon interaction that is responsible for conventional BCS superconductivity. The discovery of this material revolutionized research into superconductivity, establishingthe reality of electronically mediated superconductivity and foreshadowing the discovery {{of a wide range of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> superconductors, and the subsequent discovery of electronically mediated pairing in cuprates high temperature superconductors. The first published report of the phenomenon occurred in 1979, by which time Steglich had taken up a faculty position at the University of Darmstadt, and confirmed the existence of bulk superconductivity through the measurement of the specific heat anomaly at the transition temperature of Tc=0.5K.|$|E

An analysis of the $^{ 115 }$In nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_ 1 ^{- 1 }$ measurements under pressure reveals the presence of 2 d magnetic quantum critical fluctuations in the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> component that are a promising candidate for the pairing mechanism in this material.

40|$|A quantum {{critical}} point (QCP) develops in a material at absolute zero {{when a new}} form of order smoothly emerges in its ground state. QCPs are of great current interest because of their singular ability to influence the finite temperature properties of materials. Recently, heavy-fermion metals have {{played a key role in}} the study of antiferromagnetic QCPs. To accommodate the <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons,</b> the Fermi surface of the heavy-fermion paramagnet is larger than that of an antiferromagnet. An important unsolved question concerns whether the Fermi surface transformation at the QCP develops gradually, as expected if the magnetism is of spin density wave (SDW) type, or suddenly as expected if the <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> are abruptly localized by magnetism. Here we report measurements of the low-temperature Hall coefficient ($R_H$) - a measure of the Fermi surface volume - in the heavy-fermion metal YbRh 2 Si 2 upon field-tuning it from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. $R_H$ undergoes an increasingly rapid change near the QCP as the temperature is lowered, extrapolating to a sudden jump in the zero temperature limit. We interpret these results in terms of a collapse of the large Fermi surface and of the heavy-fermion state itself precisely at the QCP. Comment: 20 pages, 3 figures; to appear in Natur...|$|R

The e-ph thermalization time tau_{ep} increases below the Kondo temperature {{by more than}} two orders of magnitude as T = 0 K is approached. Analysis using the two-temperature model and numerical simulations based on Boltzmann's equations suggest that this anomalous slowing down of the e-ph thermalization derives from the large electronic specific heat and the suppresion of scattering between <b>heavy</b> <b>electrons</b> and phonons.

40|$|We {{discuss how}} Anderson's ideas of nominal and real valence can be {{incorporated}} into the current discussion of <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> quantum criticality. In the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> phase, the nominal valence of a screened magnetic ion differs from its real valence by one unit. We identify this discrepancy with the formation of a positively charged background we call the Kondo pseudo-potential. At the quantum critical point, the sudden collapse of the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> Fermi surface can be identified with the return of the nominal to the real valence. This leads to the interesting idea that the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> quantum critical point may involve locally critical charge degrees of freedom. We discuss how this might come about within a large N Schwinger boson scheme. Comment: Invited talk at SCES 2007, Houston, Texa...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the NMR Knight shift anomaly {{exhibited}} by {{a large number of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> materials can be understood in terms of the different hyperfine couplings of probe nuclei to localized spins and to conduction electrons. The onset of the anomaly is at a temperature T*, below which an itinerant component of the magnetic susceptibility develops. This second component characterizes the polarization of the conduction electrons by the local moments and is a signature of the emerging <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> state. The <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> component grows as log T below T*, and scales universally for all measured Ce, Yb and U based materials. Our results suggest that T* is not related to the single ion Kondo temperature, T_K, but rather represents a correlated Kondo temperature that provides a measure of the strength of the intersite coupling between the local moments.

40|$|Although the pairing glue for the {{attractive}} quasiparticle interaction responsible for unconventional superconductivity in <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> materials {{has been identified}} as the spin fluctuations that arise from their proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point, there has been no model to describe their superconducting transition at Tc that is comparable to that found by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) for conventional superconductors where phonons provide the pairing glue. Here we propose a phenomenological BCS-like expression for Tc in <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> materials, that is based on the unusual properties of the <b>heavy</b> <b>electron</b> normal state from which superconductivity emerges, and a simple model for the effective range and strength of the spin-fluctuation-induced quasiparticle interaction.
