5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. <b>Film</b> <b>projection,</b> which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|Merian Caldwell Cooper (October 24, 1893 – April 21, 1973) was an American aviator, United States Air Force and Polish Air Force officer, adventurer, screenwriter, film director, and producer. Cooper was {{the founder}} of the Kościuszko Squadron during the Polish–Soviet War and was a Soviet {{prisoner}} of war for a time. He was a notable movie producer, and got his start with film as part of the Explorers Club, traveling the world and documenting adventures. He {{was a member of the}} board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film always took priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is also credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama <b>film</b> <b>projection</b> process. Cooper's most famous film was the 1933 movie King Kong. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.|$|E

500|$|Continuous, short-arc, high {{pressure}} xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight {{and are used}} in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at {{the temperature of the}} Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical 35mm, IMAX, and digital <b>film</b> <b>projection</b> systems. They are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of 1895, {{it became clear that}} the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to {{projected}} motion pictures and, on the other, to a new [...] "peep show" [...] device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a <b>film</b> <b>projection</b> system. On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.|$|E
500|$|While on a {{break from}} recording, the band invited {{production}} designer Willie Williams to join them in Tenerife in February 1991. Williams had recently worked on David Bowie's Sound+Vision Tour, which used <b>film</b> <b>projection</b> and video content, and he was keen to [...] "take rock show video to a level as yet undreamed of". The band played Williams some of their new music—inspired by alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music—and they {{told him about the}} [...] "Zoo TV" [...] phrase that Bono liked. Williams also learned about the band's affection for the Trabant, an East German automobile that derisively became a symbol for the fall of Communism. Williams thought their fondness for the car was [...] "deeply, deeply bizarre", but nonetheless, he incorporated it into his ideas for the tour. In May, he brainstormed the idea to construct a lighting system using Trabants by hanging them from the ceiling and hollowing them to carry spotlights.|$|E

500|$|The man was Dickson; {{the little}} movie, {{approximately}} three seconds long, is now {{referred to as}} Dickson Greeting. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a [...] "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an [...] "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, [...] "I {{have been able to}} take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." [...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic <b>film</b> <b>projection</b> system that was apparently abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{combining}} motion pictures with recorded sound {{is nearly as}} old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, {{a couple of days after}} photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors privately met. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison's recorded-sound technology. No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a [...] "peep-show" [...] system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in <b>film</b> <b>projection.</b> In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition.|$|E
