5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and {{a small amount of}} history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Among the {{religious}} and Orthodox groups in Israel, many individuals chose to part <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> lifestyle and embrace a secular lifestyle (they {{are referred to as}} Yotz'im bish'ela). A research conducted in 2011 estimated that about 30 percent of the national religious youth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> lifestyle and embrace a secular lifestyle, but 75 percent of them go back to religion after a formation process of their self-identity, which usually lasts until age 28. Contrary to Baalei teshuva, the Orthodox Jews whom wish to embrace a secular lifestyle only have very few organizations whom assist them in parting from the Haredi world, and often they end up finding themselves destitute or struggling to complete the educational and social gaps. The most prominent organizations whom assist Yotz'im bish'ela are the NGO organizations Hillel and Dror.|$|E
