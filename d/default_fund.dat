40|$|Abstract: We analyse {{the range}} of <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> offered by UK {{stakeholder}} pension schemes, {{against the background of}} research that shows the majority of pension scheme members passively accept the default arrangements offered by the scheme sponsor. We find the <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> vary substantially in their strategic asset allocation and in their use of lifestyle profiles that switch the member’s assets to fixed-income investments as the planned retirement date approaches. We use a stochastic simulation model to demonstrate that the differences {{have a significant effect on}} the distribution of retirement income outcomes. We also find a wide range of outcomes for each type of fund, and that with commonly observed contribution rates defined-contribution pension schemes appear unlikely to replicate the levels of retirement income produced by typical defined benefit schemes.

50|$|Target-date {{funds were}} invented by Donald Luskin and Larry Tint of Wells Fargo Investment Advisors (later Barclays Global Investors), and first {{introduced}} in the early 1990s by BGI.

With the UK enacting auto-enrollment legislation in 2012, target-date funds are used by NEST National Employment Savings Trust, and are expected to become increasingly popular as their design should satisfy the DWP's eligible <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> criteria.|$|E
50|$|Saul {{and other}} board members {{discussed}} several future {{options for the}} TSP, including asking Congress to require automatic enrollment in the TSP for new hires, as Government employees now must {{sign up for a}} payroll deduction. Other proposals included asking Congress whether to designate a new <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> for FERS employees who do not enroll but receive a mandatory agency contribution of 1 percent of salary, since that money now goes into the government securities fund, but TSP officials think the L Funds would be a more appropriate, long-term investment. Saul also suggested adding Roth 401(k)-style feature to the TSP that is similar to Roth individual savings accounts, by allowing participants to make contributions with money that has been taxed, with the contributions growing tax-free and account balances being withdrawn tax-free. Employees now contribute pre-tax dollars to the TSP and pay taxes when they withdraw their savings. President Bush likened his social security privatization plan to the TSP, although it was never adopted. Bush believed that the TSP could {{serve as a model for}} his proposed personal accounts.|$|E
50|$|Businesses must {{consider}} all potential risk exposures when deciding whether liability insurance is needed, and, if so, how much coverage is appropriate and cost-effective.Those {{with the greatest}} public liability risk exposure are occupiers of premises where large numbers of third parties frequent at leisure including shopping centres, pubs, clubs, theatres, cinemas, sporting venues, markets, hotels and resorts. The risk increases dramatically when consumption of alcohol and sporting events are included. Certain industries such as security and cleaning are considered high risk by underwriters. In some cases underwriters even refuse to insure the liability of these industries or choose to apply a large deductible in order to minimise the potential compensations.Private individuals also occupy land and engage in potentially dangerous activities. For example, a rotten branch may fall from an old tree and injure a pedestrian, and many people ride bicycles and skateboards in public places. The majority of states require motorists to carry insurance and criminalise those who drive without a valid policy. Many also require insurance companies to provide a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> to offer compensation to those physically injured in accidents where the driver {{did not have a}} valid policy.|$|E

The financial market incompleteness {{arises from the}} inability to trade human capital claims. Using numerical methods to solve for equilibrium, we show first that default-free defined benefit pension plans are welfare-improving even in a dynamically efficient economy. Second, we show that {{in the presence of}} <b>default</b> risk <b>funding</b> regulations improve aggregate welfare by making larger size plans more attractive and that full funding is not necessarily the optimal policy.

40|$|Central {{counterparties}} (CCPs) {{have increasingly}} become {{a cornerstone of}} financial markets infrastructure. We present a model where trades are time-critical, liquidity is limited and there is limited enforcement of trades. We show a CCP novating trades implements efficient trading behaviour. It is optimal for the CCP to face default losses to achieve the efficient level of trade. To cover these losses, the CCP optimally uses margin calls, and, as the default problem becomes more severe, also requires <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> and then imposes position limits...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} against the potential losses {{in case of a}} participant's default and to contain systemic risk, central counterparties (CCPs) need to maintain sufficient financial resources. Typically, these financial resources consist of margin requirements and contributions to a collective <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> Based on a stylized model of CCP risk management, this article analyzes the main factors affecting the trade-off between margins and <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> The optimal balance between these two risk management instruments is found to depend on collateral costs, participants' default probability, {{and the extent to which}} margin requirements are associated with risk-mitigating incentives. Given the increasing role of CCPs in financial markets in general and for financial stability in particular, these considerations are not only important for CCPs themselves, but also for financial regulators.

40|$|Abstract: Most defined {{contribution}} (DC) {{pension schemes}} give their members {{a degree of}} choice over the investment strategy to be followed with their contributions. Many schemes also offer a ‘default ’ fund for members who are {{unable or unwilling to}} choose their own investment strategy. Previous research shows that where a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> exists, the majority of members adopt it as the path of least resistance, meaning the provider’s choice of <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> has the potential to {{have a significant effect on}} the welfare of the members. Given the importance of this decision by the pension scheme provider, we analyse the range of default funds offered by UK stakeholder pension schemes, which by law must offer a <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> We find the default funds vary substantially in their strategic asset allocation and in their use of lifestyle profiles that switch the member’s assets to fixed-income investments as the planned retirement date approaches.

5000|$|Another way {{to enhance}} credit {{protection}} is to issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate than the underlying mortgages. For example, if the weighted average interest {{rate of the}} mortgage pool is 7%, the CMO issuer could choose to issue bonds that pay a 5% coupon.

If some of the mortgage loans go delinquent or <b>default,</b> <b>funds</b> from the excess spread account can be used to pay the bondholders. Excess spread is a very effective mechanism for protecting bondholders from defaults that occur late in the life of the deal because by that time the funds in the excess spread account will be sufficient to cover almost any losses.|$|R
40|$|The UK Government's {{workplace}} pension reforms introduce {{major changes}} {{to the way in}} which employees save for retirement. Eligible employees will be automatically enrolled into a workplace-based pension scheme and, for the first time in the UK, employers will be legally required to contribute to employees’ pensions. This article critically examines the evidence from New Zealand and Australia, two countries that have undergone pension reforms similar in some ways to the UK reforms. We assess what we can learn from their experiences in two areas: firstly, how pension schemes are structured and, secondly, the outcomes for individuals. The evidence highlights the potential of automatic enrolment to overcome people's disinterest in pension saving. At the same time, relatively few UK employees are likely to choose where their pension savings are invested. As a result, <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> will play an important role in determining the pension outcomes for individuals...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) This study {{investigates the}} best measure of extreme {{losses in the}} South African equity {{derivatives}} market, and applies this to estimate {{the size of a}} <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> for Safcom, the central counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivatives in South Africa. The predictive abilities of historic simulation Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), Extreme VaR (EVaR) calculated using a Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and stress testing are compared during historic periods of stress in this market. The iterative cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) algorithm of Inclan and Tiao (1994) is applied to identify significant and large, positive shifts in the volatility of returns, thus indicating the start of a stress period. The FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index Future (known as the ALSI future) is used as a proxy for this market. Two key periods of stress are identified, namely the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. The maximum daily losses in the ALSI during these stress periods were observed on 28 October 1997 and 6 October 2008. For the VaR-based loss estimates, 2500 trading days’ returns up to 28 October 1997 and 2750 trading days’ returns up to 6 October 2008 is used. The study finds that Extreme VaR predicts extreme losses during these two historic periods of stress the most accurately and is consequently applied to the quantification of a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> for Safcom, using 2500 daily returns from 5 June 2003 to 31 May 2013. The EVaR-based estimation of a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> shows that the current Safcom <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> is sufficient to provide for market losses equivalent to what was suffered during the 2008 global financial crisis, but not sufficient for the magnitude of losses suffered during the 1997 Asian crisis...|$|E

The total cost of the clearance framework for a clearing member, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a CVA corresponding to the cost of its losses on the <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> in case of defaults of other member, an MVA corresponding to the cost of funding its margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital and also of the capital at risk that the member implicitly provides to the CCP through its <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> contribution. In the end the structure of the XVA equations for bilateral and cleared portfolios is similar, but the input data to these equations are not the same, reflecting different financial network structures. The resulting XVA numbers differ, but, interestingly enough, they become comparable after scaling by a suitable netting ratio...|$|E
