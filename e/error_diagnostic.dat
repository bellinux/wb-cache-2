40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this article, we {{describe}} {{some of the}} cognitive and system-based sources of detection and interpretation <b>errors</b> in <b>diagnostic</b> radiology and discuss potential approaches to help reduce misdiagnoses. CONCLUSION: Every radiologist worries about missing a diagnosis or giving a false-positive reading. The retrospective error rate among radiologic examinations is approximately 30 %, with real-time errors in daily radiology practice averaging 3 - 5 %. Nearly 75 % of all medical malpractice claims against radiologists are related to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors.</b> As medical reimbursement trends downward, radiologists attempt to compensate by undertaking additional responsibilities to increase productivity. The increased workload, rising quality expectations, cognitive biases, and poor system factors all contribute to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> in radiology. <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> are underrecognized and underappreciated in radiology practice. This {{is due to the}} inability to obtain reliable national estimates of the impact, the difficulty in evaluating effectiveness of potential interventions, and the poor response to systemwide solutions. Most of our clinical work is executed through type 1 processes to minimize cost, anxiety, and delay; however, type 1 processes are also vulnerable to errors. Instead of trying to completely eliminate cognitive shortcuts that serve us well most of the time, becoming aware of common biases and using metacognitive strategies to mitigate the effects have the potential to create sustainable improvement in <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} in detail a new method {{for the single}} gate-level design error diagnosis in combinational circuits. Distinctive features of the method are hierarchical approach (the localizing procedure starts at the macro level and finishes at the gate level), use of stuck-at fault model (it is mapped into design error domain only in the end), and design <b>error</b> <b>diagnostic</b> procedure that uses only test patterns generated by conventional gate-level stuck-at fault test pattern generators (ATPG). No special diagnostic tests are used because {{they are much more}} time consuming. Binary decision diagrams (BDD) are exploited for representing and localizing stuck-at faults on the higher signal path level. On the basis of detected faulty signal paths, suspected stuck-at faults at gate inputs are calculated, and then mapped into suspected design error(s). This method is enhanced compared to our previous work. It is applicable to redundant circuits and allows using incomplete tests for error diagnosis. Experimental data on ISCAS benchmark circuits shows the advantage of the proposed method compared to the known algorithms of design error diagnosis. 1...|$|E

A simple implementation of the system, its models, and inference engine are demonstrated. The concept of domain modeling means that information about a certain topic is utilized by a program {{in such a way that}} the program bases decisions on the contents of the data. It is also to be expected that this data will be undergoing continuous update, causing the aforementioned program to respond differently even when presented with the same inputs at different times between which changes have occured in the data associated with the domain model. This concept is not new but few systems have been built that utilize this idea in a robust manner to model a users knowledge, interests, and skill. In essence a system that is based on this concept would be identified as being part of the family of AI based, or Expert, systems. The use of modeling does not necessarily dictate that the resulting system is an AI system but it exhibits some of the properties associated with AI. Models can be created that are representative of topics in many areas. They are limited only in that the domain being modeled be expressible in quantitative terms i. e. equations or data structures that can be manipulated by a program...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Diagnostic errors have {{a natural}} complexity. Medical diagnoses make up a large {{proportion}} of all medical errors and cause much suffering and harm. Compared to other types of <b>error,</b> <b>diagnostic</b> errors receive little attention-a major factor in continuity of unacceptable rates of diagnostic error. Case: A 55 -year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of bone pain which has been started a month ago and increased gradually in the upper right thigh. Following the emergency evaluation she was sent home with pain medication. On the second visit, a femur neck fracture was seen in the x-ray. She underwent hemiarthroplasty and was discharged. Over several weeks she was reevaluated by many Physicians, because of her worsening pain. In the third visit after the surgery, her x-ray showed bone destruction and following bone biopsy, malignant paraganglioma was diagnosed. Discussion and solution: In all cases in which patient comes to us with skeletal pain, getting a comprehensive history and a full physical examination are prior to lab tests and x-rays. Bone metastasis which can develop severe pain and pathological fractures, is common in patients with malignant paraganglioma. Effective steps for diagnostic error prevention are: Considering the diagnostic error in the normal range of quality assurance surveillance and review, identifying the elements leading to diagnostic errors and getting feedback on the diagnoses Physicians make, in order to improve their skills.

40|$|The {{formation}} of leakages in the membrane in PEFC {{is a relatively}} frequent failure mode {{which leads to a}} significant loss of performance or loss of the fuel cell functionality. The leakages occur due to a malfunction during the manufacturing process of the membrane or the membrane-electrode-assembly (e. g. penetration of a carbon fiber from the GDL), the assembling the fuel cell (mechanical stress) or be dry-wet cycling of the membrane. Leakages in the membrane allow the reactant gases to cross the membrane and to react directly without generation of electricity. This reaction takes place on the catalyst surfaces like the electrochemical reactions. Consequently, at the leakage a local mixed potential will be formed. Caused by the electrical in-plane conductivity of the electrodes, gas diffusion layer, bipolar plates and membrane the local potential influences the residual electrode, and consequently, an electrochemical mass conversion depending on the local potentials starts. In current density measurements the local electrochemical mass conversion is measured. Alterations in the current density distributions are related to varying local operating conditions. For a cell at open circuit condition the total (integral) current is zero. However, in the cell at open circuit conditions different current directions will be occur in the cell in some areas. This can be clearly observed in the current density distribution measurements. Typically in the cell at open circuit conditions, the currents in the individual segments are all nearly zero, because the local conditions in the cell do not varies significantly. In contrast, if the cell has a leakage, at the leakage a mixed potential will be formed. Consequently, the local conditions in the cell at the leakage are significant changed compared with the undamaged areas. The lateral differences in the local potentials induce equalizing currents which can clearly detect in the current density measurement. In the current density measurement the equalizing current in the bipolar plate, which is the main equalizing current caused by the better in-plane conductivity compared with the in-plane conductivity of the membrane and the gas diffusion layer, is measured. Under load the current density distribution are changed with the cell voltages. If the cell has a leakage the changes are more significant as in an undamaged cell. The current density measurements on the cell with a leakage show clearly, that current density measurements are a powerful tool for <b>error</b> <b>diagnostic</b> in fuel cells...|$|E

There is {{an urgent need}} to improve education on clinical reasoning to reduce <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors.</b> However, {{little is known about}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> of medical students. In this study, the nature of the causes of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> made by medical students was analyzed. Methods In June 2016, 88 medical students worked on eight cases with the chief complaint dyspnea in a laboratory setting using an electronic learning platform, in summary 704 processed cases. The diagnostic steps of the students were tracked and analyzed. Furthermore, after each case the participants stated their presumed diagnosis and explained why they came to their diagnostic conclusion. The content of these explanations was analyzed qualitatively. Results Based on the diagnostic data gathering process and the students’ explanations, eight different causes could be identified of which the lack of diagnostic skills (24 %) and inadequate knowledge base (16 %) were the most common. Other causes that often contributed to a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>error</b> were faulty context generation (15 %) and premature closure (10 %). The causes of misdiagnosis varied per case.

We {{evaluated}} our {{quality assurance}} (QA) methods and QA consensus conference model for as-sessing {{the rate of}} interpretational <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> and trend of errors. Using monthly QA reports from review of frozen section- permanent section correlation and amended reports, all cases with interpretational <b>diagnostic</b> <b>errors</b> were identified. Retrospective blinded review of study cases were independently performed by all staff pathologist and subsequently discussed in QA conference sessions. 277 (. 07 %) interpretational errors were identified from 1993 - 2010. Errors with patient consequences com-prised 15 % of all errors, 4 % of which were major errors. More than half (57 %) of the errors were identified on review of frozen section- permanent section correlation and accounted for 64 % of all errors with patient consequence and 45 % of major errors. Comparison of errors between two equally divided time periods (1993 - 2001 and 2002 - 2010) showed significant error reduction (p< 0. 05). 64 % of all errors, 61 % of errors with patient consequence and 73 % of major errors were a consequence of incorrect interpretation of the biologic behavior of the neoplasm. To conclude, we propose this quality assurance model as an effective tool for assessing interpretational er-rors, particularly those with significant patient consequences, enhancing participation of pathologists and reducing errors.
