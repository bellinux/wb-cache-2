'' Zeta potential depends on the solution composition and the surface final conditions, The zeta potentials on AISI 304 stainless steel with 2 B and BA surface finishes were measured in KNO 3 -containing me dia for several cleaning treatments. Depending on the cleaning treatments and the <b>industrial</b> <b>finish</b> conditions, the zeta potentials range as follows: GRAPHICS Measurements were also performed in chloride-containing media after an ethanol cleaning, At pH higher than the isoelectric point, the zeta potential also depends on the finish conditions.

40|$|Polishing of {{tool steels}} for e. g. {{injection}} moulding of plastic parts or direct polishing of products {{is perhaps the}} most important <b>industrial</b> <b>finishing</b> process today. Polishing is often made manually to ensure the highest quality and nanometre roughness. This study compare steel samples prepared in different companies to study how different polishing sequences affect final surface qualities, i. e. trying to find crucial factors controlling high gloss appearance and defect levels. The samples were prepared in a way that every step of the polishing process could be studied quantitatively at nanometre level using phase shifting- and coherence scanning interferometry. In addition, all samples were qualitatively documented and judged visually by the polishers themselves. It could be concluded that a ‘several-step’ strategy in combination with short polishing time was advantageous. Also, guidelines for tool and abrasive selection is presented suggesting cotton as carrier and diamonds of 1 µm size for more time efficient final polishing.

40|$|The rising {{awareness}} of energy consumption {{and the environmental}} impact of manufacturing underline the need to implement structured approaches, such as a life cycle assessment, or metrics for process evaluation. Energy savings on their own are not sufficient to increase the process efficiency of <b>industrial</b> <b>finishing</b> operations, since the results, in terms of machined part quality, have to be accounted for. The research work presented in this paper applies sustainable development concepts to an industrial case study. A shaping grinding process (a flute grinding operation for tap manufacturing) has been assessed experimentally. The effects of variations in the process parameters have been discussed, with respect to processing time, energy consumption, and product quality/integrity. Whenever the optimization goals are in contrast, a trade-off between product requirements and process sustainability has to be introduced. In order to achieve energy savings, without altering the performance of the product, a specific efficiency sustainability indicator has been implemented and coupled to the life cycle inventory phase. The results provide a tool that can assist the decision-making stage and can be incorporated into a business strategy development framewor...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Autonomous robot-based {{finishing}} of surfaces with {{a reduction}} of the programming effort {{can be achieved by}} teaching the desired trajectory locally in the object reference frame. Thus, the flexibility of the programmed task increases and also moving surfaces can be finished. This paper aims to focus on this control concept. Design/methodology/approach - The developed concept relies both on the use of a new slip sensor which is able to measure relative motion between the robot end-effector and the machined object surface as well as on a continuous slip and force control algorithm. First experimental results were used to validate the concept. Findings - The presented results were promising enough to encourage the application of the proposed concept scheme in connection with the slip sensor in <b>industrial</b> <b>finishing</b> applications. Research limitations/implications - The first investigations provide a basis for the development of more accurate software solutions in order to optimise the performances of the slip sensor. Practical implications - The developed slip sensor provides a cheap and flexible solution for measuring relative motion between tool and surface. Combined {{with the use of a}} force sensor, the proposed scheme can be introduce more autonomy in industrial application like polishing or deburring. Originality/value - The paper introduces a novel slip and force control concept for coping with the industry requirement of introducing more automation in the finishing of surfaces. Such a control concept allows on one hand the finishing of moving parts and at the same time increases the flexibility of the programming and reduces the user effort...|$|R
