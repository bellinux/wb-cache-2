40|$|This paper {{reports the}} trial {{comparing}} N management in two crop systems: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) living mulch with subclover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) (field 1), and winter wheat pure standing with organic N fertilization (field 2). Subclover {{is supposed to}} fix N 2 and to release {{a part of it}} to wheat plants. Wheat grain yield <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 is 2227 kg/ha, <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2 is 2272 kg/ha, with no statistically-significant difference (95 % level). However, the wheat biomass accumulation at the start of heading <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 (2635 kg/ha) is significantly lower than that <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2 (3100 kg/ha). NPK content in wheat plant tissue is also obviously lower <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 than <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2 during the stem extension stage. Soil soluble N content <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 is also lower than that <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2 <b>in</b> the same period. DRIS (Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System method) is applied to illustrate N deficiency <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1. Although after heading soil N availability <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 is higher than that <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2, final N accumulation in wheat biomass is still 15 % lower than <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2. Subclover grows slowly during the early spring, while after winter wheat heading, it grows fast from 137. 2 kg/ha dry weight to 508. 7 kg/ha in 15 days. Soil soluble N content <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 1 is also higher than <b>in</b> <b>field</b> 2 during this period. However, when wheat plants start heading, the biomass accumulation is already nearly 90 % of maximum biomass yield. Evidence shows that the effect from sub clover fixed N 2 is lower...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>fields</b> such as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where {{direct observation}} or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, {{the scientific method}} instead relies on observation and logical inference.

When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
