The FDP well planning {{was based on a}} seismic amplitude "Qualitative Interpretation (QI) " study that recommended drilling the areas with high amplitudes as an indication for gas presence, and it ignored the low amplitude areas even if it is structurally high. A follow up study was conducted in 2010 for "H" area fields using the same seismic data and the well data <b>drilled</b> <b>post</b> FDP. The new static and dynamic work revealed the wrong aspect of the 2006 QI study, and proved with evidence from well logs and production data that low seismic amplitudes in high structural areas have sweet spots of good reservoir quality rock. This has led to changing the old appraisal strategy and planning more wells in low amplitude areas with high structure and hence discovering new blocks that increased the reserves of the fields. Furthermore, water production in these fields started much earlier than FDP expectation. The subsurface team have integrated deeply with the operation team and started a project to find new solutions to handle the water production and enhance the gas rate. The subsurface team also started drilling horizontal wells in the fields to increase the UR, delay the water production and also reduce the wells total CAPEX by drilling less horizontal wells compared to many vertical as they have higher production and recovery.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the bond strength of different root canal sealers to dentin. Material and Methods: Forty extracted single-rooted human teeth were examined and the coronal and middle thirds of the canals were prepared with a 1. 50 mm <b>post</b> <b>drill</b> (FibreKor <b>Post</b> System, Pentron). The teeth were allocated in two experimental groups, irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl+ 17 % EDTA or saline solution (control group) and instrumented using Race rotary files (FKG) to a size # 40 at the working length. Then, the groups were divided into four subgroups and filled with Epiphany sealer (Group 1), EndoREZ (Group 2), AH 26 (Group 3) and Grossman's Sealer (Group 4). After 2 weeks of storage in 100 % humidity at 37 degrees C, all teeth were sectioned transversally into 2 -mm-thick discs. Push-out tests were performed at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min using a universal testing machine. The maximum load at failure was recorded and expressed in MPa. Results: Means (+/- SD) in root canals irrigated with 2. 5 % NaOCl and 17 % EDTA were: G 1 (21. 6 +/- 6. 0), G 2 (15. 2 +/- 3. 7), G 3 (14. 6 +/- 4. 5) and G 4 (11. 7 +/- 4. 1).

After 1 week, teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups (n= 10) that differed for the drill type used for post space preparation: Group 1 : Calibrated drill; Group 2 : Largo drill; Group 3 : MTwo <b>drill.</b> Illusion <b>posts</b> were luted into the root canals using Gradia Core. After 24 hours, posted roots were transversally cut into 1 mm-thick slices for thin-slice post push-out testing. Two slices per apical, middle, and coronal thirds were obtained, resulting in a total of 6 slices per tooth. Thin-slice push-out test was conducted using a universal testing machine. Post push-out strength was measured in MPa. For the fracture analysis, the specimens were observed using a stereomicroscope at x 40 magnification and classified as adhesive [between post-cement (P-C) or dentin-cement (D-C) interface], cohesive (within the post or adhesive cement) and mixed (adhesive and cohesive fractures occurred simultaneously). Between-group differences in post retentive strength were statistically analyzed (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Dunn's Multiple Range test, P > 0. 05). Differences in push-out strength among root levels within each group (one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, depending on the normality of data distribution, P > 0. 05) and in failure mode distribution were also statistically evaluated (Fisher's Exact Test, P > 0. 05).

The bonded posts were experimentally loaded until failure and the maximum load to fracture was registered. Fracture patterns were qualitatively evaluated and SEM analysis was performed to assess the quality of endodontic treatments and cementation. Data were statistically analysed by means of one-way ANOVA. ResultsThe mean maximum load to fracture was 165. 05 ± 23. 46 N in G 1, 151. 52 ± 16. 23 N in G 2 and 129. 09 ± 15. 25 N in G 3. Statistically significant differences were pointed out between G 1 and G 3 (p< 0. 01) and G 2 and G 3 (p< 0. 05). No root fractures were evidenced. SEM analyses showed slightly thicker cement layers at the apical and middle thirds of single taper posts (G 2 and G 3). ConclusionsDT Light Post and SurgiPost Multiconical fibre posts showed similar properties in terms of mechanical resistance to fracture and {{higher than those of}} Tech ES Endoshape.

500|$|The {{meeting on}} 9 August was {{postponed}} after magistrates banned it {{to discourage the}} radicals but Hunt and his followers were determined to assemble and a meeting was organised for 16 August, with its declared aim solely [...] "to consider the propriety of adopting the most LEGAL and EFFECTUAL means of obtaining a reform in the Common House of Parliament". The press had mocked earlier meetings of working men because of their ragged, dirty appearance and disorganised conduct, but the organisers were determined that those attending the St Peter's Field meeting would be neatly turned out and march to the event in good order. Samuel Bamford, a local radical who led the Middleton contingent, wrote that [...] "It was deemed expedient that this meeting should be as morally effective as possible, and, that it should exhibit a spectacle such as {{had never before been}} witnessed in England." [...] Instructions were given to the various committees forming the contingents that [...] "Cleanliness, Sobriety, Order and Peace" [...] and a [...] "prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence" [...] were to be observed throughout the demonstration. Each contingent was drilled and rehearsed in the fields of the townships around Manchester adding to the concerns of the authorities. A royal proclamation forbidding the practice of <b>drilling</b> had been <b>posted</b> in Manchester on 3 August but on 9 August an informant reported to Rochdale magistrates that at Tandle Hill the previous day, 700 men were [...] "drilling in companies" [...] and [...] "going through the usual evolutions of a regiment" [...] and an onlooker had said the men [...] "were fit to contend with any regular troops, only they wanted arms" ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{in vitro}} the fracture resistance {{of two different}} post systems, a conventional one with post space preparation using a drill and an alternative one adapted to the canal shape. Methodology: After sample size calculation, the crowns of 26 single-rooted freshly-extracted teeth were removed with a disc 1 mm coronal to the cemento-enamel junction. The canals were shaped with Mtwo rotary files up to size 40, 0. 06 tpaer and filled with the continuous wave of condensation technique leaving the coronal 9 mm of the canal unfilled. After the post space preparation by a dedicated <b>drill,</b> double-tapered fibre <b>posts</b> (DT Light-Post) were cemented in half of the roots (G 1, n = 13). 0. 06 tapered fibre posts (Tech S Endoshape) were trimmed to fit the canal of the remaining roots (G 2, n = 13) and then cemented without post space preparation. A self- adhesive cement (RelyX Unicem) was used in both groups. The posts were cut 5 mm from the root coronal surface. The specimens were embedded in acrylic resin {{and the top of}} the post was loaded under continuous compressive force (45 °, 0. 75 mm/min) to measure the maximum breaking load (N). Data were statistically analyzed by using a Student’s t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean maximum breaking loads ±SD were G 1 = 164. 07 ± 21. 54 and G 2 = 151. 22 ± 14. 69. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 093). Only post fractures were detected, with all the roots remaining intact. Conclusions: Within the limitation of the study, conservative posts without post space preparation performed similarly to conventional ones. In order to avoid procedural errors during the post space preparation and to spare tooth structure a conservative approach seems advisable...|$|R
40|$|Background: With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} methods that could increase the fracture resistance of structurally compromised endodontically treated teeth, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the effect of three esthetic post systems on the fracture resistance and failure modes of structurally compromised and normal roots. Materials and Methods: Forty five extracted and endodontically treated maxillary central teeth were assigned to 5 experimental groups (n= 9). In two groups, the post spaces were prepared with the corresponding <b>drills</b> of the <b>post</b> systems to be restored with double taper light posts (DT. Light-Post) (group DT. N) and zirconia posts (Cosmopost) (group Zr. N). In other 3 groups thin wall canals were simulated to be restored with Double taper Light posts (DT. W), double taper Light posts and Ribbond fibers (DT+R. W) and Zirconia posts (Zr. W). After access cavity restoration and thermocycling, compressive load was applied and the fracture strength values and failure modes were evaluated. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Tukey and Fisher exact tests (P< 0. 05). Results: The mean failure loads (N) were 678. 56, 638. 22, 732. 44, 603. 44 and 573. 67 for groups DT. N, Zr. N, DT. W, DT+R. W and Zr. w respectively. Group DT+R. W exhibited significantly higher resistance to fracture compared to groups Zr. N, DT. W and Zr. w (P< 0. 05). A significant difference was detected between groups DT. N and Zr. W (P= 0. 027). Zirconia posts showed significantly higher root fracture compared to fiber posts (P= 0. 004). Conclusion: The structurally compromised teeth restored with double taper light posts and Ribbond fibers showed the most fracture resistance and their strengths were comparable to those of normal roots restored with double taper light posts. More desirable fracture patterns were observed in teeth restored with fiber posts...|$|R
40|$|In 1996 a {{geothermal}} energy project was initiated at Klaipėda, Lithuania, {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of using low enthalpy geothermal water as a renewable energy resource in district heating systems. The Klaipėda geothermal plant is situated within the West Lithuanian geothermal anomaly with a relatively high heat flow density of 70 - 90 mW/m 2 and contains two geothermal injectors and producers. The injectivity of the wells has been deteriorating ever since plant start-up due to chemical precipitation, fines mobilization and scaling. In November 2014, radial jetting technology {{was identified as a}} possible solution for enhancing injectivity of the wells. With radial jet drilling, several open hole laterals of 100 m maximum length and with a diameter of 0. 03 m to 0. 05 m are jetted from the main well bore in order to enhance the connectivity of the well to the rock and thereby the well productivity or injectivity. In one of the injection wells at Klaipėda, 12 horizontal laterals of around 40 m in length were jetted in a number of highly permeable layers present in the aquifer. Production data <b>post</b> <b>drilling</b> of the laterals suggest an improvement in injectivity of approximately 14 %. A base case scenario was constructed based on the specifications of the radial jetting job at Klaipėda. For the base case scenario, assuming the laterals were all jetted according to the specifications, the increase in injectivity was estimated at 56 %. An uncertainty analysis was carried out to investigate the impact of uncertainties in the length, positioning, diameter, inclination, and pre-existing near wellbore damage of the laterals on the water injection rate. The sensitivity of the injection rate to uncertainties in the lateral design parameters varies between 2. 2 % and 13. 4 % for the parameters evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} glass fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) posts of different diameters on the failure load of endodontically treated teeth with different remaining dentine and reinforcing resin composite (RRC) thicknesses and the mode of failure in each group. Methods: Fifty extracted intact human maxillary central incisors were decoronated 2 mm incisal to buccal CEJ and endodontically treated. The teeth were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the five groups (n= 10) : Group B (Blue), post space prepared with size 0 <b>post</b> <b>drill</b> (Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein) /size 0 FRC post/no RRC; Group W(White), size 1 post space/size 1 FRC post/no RRC; Group R(Red), size 3 post space/size 3 FRC post/no RRC; Group WR, size 3 post space/size 1 FRC post/RRC; Group BR, size 3 post space/size 0 FRC post/RRC. Ferrule of 2 mm and 0. 5 mm were prepared at facio-lingual and proximal margins respectively. All specimens were restored with Ni-Cr crowns, thermocycled and loaded at 135 ° from the long axis in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min until fracture. Data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) with α= 0. 05. Results: Mean failure loads (N) for Groups B, W, R, WR and BR were: 1406. 05 (SD= 376. 14), 1258. 76 (379. 35), 1084. 54 (528. 37), 958. 79 (199. 87) and 815. 91 (298. 31). Significant differences were found between Group B and BR. Group B has the highest favourable failure mode. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the remaining dentine is the most important factor in fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth and produces the most favourable fracture if failure occurs (Group B). Therefore, the use of smaller FRC post and RRC is recommended rather than enlargement of post spaces to fit accurately larger FRC posts as the enlargement of post spaces increases the risk of unfavourable failure...|$|R
40|$|As {{hotspots}} {{of local}} biodiversity {{in the deep}} sea, preservation of cold-water coral reef communities is of great importance. In European waters the most extensive reefs are found at depths of 300 - 500 m on the continental margin. In Norwegian waters many of these reefs are located in areas of interest {{for oil and gas}} exploration and production. In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small Lophelia pertusa coral reefs (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and > 1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There {{were no significant differences in}} Lophelia pertusa polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of > 25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material. From the video data collected, there were no observed degradations of reef structure over time, nor reductions of associate fauna abundance, regardless of modelled exposure concentration at any of the surveyed reefs. This study focused exclusively on adult fauna, and did not assess the potential hazard posed by waste drilling material to coral or other larvae. Video data was collected by various ROV's, using different camera and lighting setups throughout the survey campaign, making comparison of observations prior, during and <b>post</b> <b>drilling</b> problematic. A standardization of video monitoring in future monitoring campaigns is recommended...|$|R
40|$|As {{the modern}} day {{extended}} reached wells are getting {{longer and more}} complex, the torque and drag {{is one of the}} restraining aspects for achieving the target depth. Torque and drag becomes a precarious issue, for example {{it can be difficult to}} land the long completion string. Therefore, understanding the friction in the wellbore and how it affects hook load and torque is essential for well path design in planning phase as well as for real time monitoring analysis and post analysis. In planning phase the offset well torque and drag profiles will be used to better well planning. In real time monitoring the torque and drag roadmaps will be used as the well is drilling in order to warn us about upcoming potential <b>drilling</b> problems. In <b>post</b> analysis the torque and drag profiles will be analyzed in order to optimize the well path and drillstring design of new wells in the same area. There are some confusion about torque and drag software and validity of models that are used to characterize drilling operation, especially as the well trajectory is getting more complex. The objective of this study is to perform a sensitivity analysis on different parameters that affect torque and drag in drilling wellbores. The parameters that will be investigated in this project are those which are place of negotiation among individuals; in a way that some of them believe the effect of such parameters are negligible whereas some have opinion that effects of these parameters must be taken into account. These parameters are: Extra friction due to sheave Friction due to hydrodynamic viscous drag force Effect of weight on bit (WOB) on torque In order to carry out this study Landmark WellPlan software has been used. For the effect of viscous drag forces Kristian Gjesrstad’s medium-order flow model for dynamic pressure surges (Gjerstad, March 2013) was used to compare the results obtained from WellPlan. The Gjerstad’s model takes into account the effects of combined axial and rotational movement of pipe as well as the flow regimes...|$|R
40|$|There {{are over}} 602, 000 bridges in the United States, of which 12. 5 % are {{classified}} as functionally obsolete and 11. 2 % are structurally deficient. The functionally obsolete bridges will require expansion or replacement to increase the service capacity of the bridge. The structurally deficient bridges will either need remediation of the load carrying elements which are damaged or deteriorated or {{will need to be}} replaced completely. Replacement of the bridges means new construction; new construction means better design and quality assurance to meet the 100 + year service life requirement in place now. Rehabilitation of bridges will require better design and quality assurance to increase the current service life of the structure. This dissertation presents new design, testing, and repair methods developed to extend the life of new and existing bridges through pressure grouting, thermal integrity testing of drilled shafts, and the bond enhancement of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) repair materials bonded to concrete with vacuum bagging and pressure bagging, respectively. Pressure grouting of drilled shaft tips has been used for over five decades to improve the end bearing capacity, but no rational design procedure had ever been published until this study. The research outlined in this dissertation analyzed nine grouted shafts and compared them to standard design procedures to determine the improvement in end bearing. Improvements ranged from 60 % to 709 % increase in end bearing capacity. From these improvements, a design procedure was developed for pressure grouted <b>drilled</b> shafts. <b>Post</b> construction inspection of drilled shafts relies largely on non-visual techniques dealing with measured concrete quantities, acoustic wave speed or frequency, gamma radiation attenuation and now the internal temperature of the curing concrete. Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP), developed at USF, utilizes the heat of hydration of curing concrete to evaluate the concrete cover, foundation shape, cage alignment, and concrete mix design performance. This research developed standard test equipment and procedures for thermal integrity testing. Comparing the results of the different types of integrity tests is difficult due to the varied nature of the different tests. The dissertation looked at various shafts constructed across the nation which were tested with thermal and at least one other integrity test method. When compared to acoustic and gamma radiation test results, TIP agreed with 4 of 6 cases for acoustic and 2 of 5 cases using gamma radiation. In the one case were both sonic caliper and inclination data were available, TIP showed good agreement. Vacuum bagging and pressure bagging are techniques for improving the FRP-concrete bond in the repair of partially submerged piles. Prototype vacuum bagging and pressure bagging systems were developed and bond improvement assessed from results of pullout tests on full size piles repaired under simulated tidal exposures in the laboratory. Pressure bagging gave better bond and was found to be simpler because it did not require an airtight seal. A field demonstration project was conducted in which pressure bagging was used in combination with two different glass FRP systems to repair two corroding piles supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge across Tampa Bay. Inspection of the post-cured wrap showed no evidence of air voids...|$|R

Male (N= 40), atom-aged (2005 / 2006 birth years), hockey players were recruited to participate and assigned to one of three groups; PP (n= 16), PP+OL (n= 15) and control (n= 9). All groups completed one 50 -minute familiarization session and two assessment sessions [pre-training (Apre) and post-training (Apost) ] consisting of off- and on-ice assessments. The PP group received eight, 50 -minute on-ice SPC training sessions. The PP+OL group received the same on-ice training, plus an additional 10 -minute observational learning session before each on-ice session. Only PP and PP+OL completed a retention assessment (Aret) following a two-week period of no training. The off-ice assessment consisted of height (cm), weight (kg) and a modified Aggiss and Walsh (1986) coordination assessment (# of successful repetitions). The on-ice assessment consisted of two forward skating drills measuring execution time (s) and five SPC drills, measuring interval time (s), execution time (s) and execution competency. Execution competency was assessed on a 12 -point scale for each device within each SPC drill by an expert rater. Multiple two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant interactions between groups in execution time or competency on any of the five SPC drills, combined overall total time (COTT) or total competency (COTC). Significant main effects of training were revealed across the three assessments for execution time on 3 / 5 SPC drills and COTT, and execution competency on 1 / 5 SPC <b>drills.</b> A Bonferroni <b>post</b> hoc revealed execution time for Apost and Aret were significantly faster than Apre for 2 / 5 SPC drills and COTT, and execution time for Apost was significantly faster than Apre for 1 / 5 SPC drills (p≤. 05). The control group revealed no significant differences between Apre and Apost for execution time or competency. In summary, eight, 50 -minute on-ice SPC training sessions elicited an improvement in execution time while maintaining competency, however, the combination of PP+OL did not reveal further training benefits...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Stress {{transmission}} to {{the root}} through passive fitting dental posts is partly influenced by {{the thickness of the}} cement layer between the post and the prepared root canal surface as well as the fit of the post in the root canal. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the cement gap between the post surfaces and the root canals using five prefabricated, tapered, unthreaded titanium posts of different manufacturers, without and with cement. Methods. Following the endodontic treatment with hand instruments of 100 intact anterior teeth, post spaces were prepared using opening drills of the corresponding size of post. Fifty posts were cemented with zinc phosphate cement in{{to the root}}s for each system while another 50 posts were inserted into the canal without using the cement. After histological sectioning, the cement gap was measured at six sites for three times at the coronal, middle and apical regions between the root canal wall and the post surface under a light microscope before and after cementation. Results. Before cementation, the highest overall cement gap was observed with the Dr Mooser post system (R) (46 mu m) and the lowest with the Velva post system (R) and Cylindro-Conical system (R) (30 mu m). Significantly less (P 0. 001) compared with Velva-Post (R) (38, 20 mu m) at the coronal and middle part, respectively (Mann-Whitney U-test, Boneferroni correction). Significant differences (P < 0. 001) were observed between the cement gap at the coronal and apical part for the Cylindro-Conical system (R) (79, 46 mu m), Dr Mooser post system (R) (45, 56 mu m) and MP Pirec post system (R) (25, 52 mu m). After cementation, the highest cement gap at the coronal part was obtained with the Cylindro-Conical system (R) (79 +/- 21 mu m) and the lowest with the MP Pirec post system (R) (25 +/- 9 mu m). However, at the apical end, the MP Pirec post system (R) (52 +/- 89 gm) and Dr Mooser post system (R) (56 +/- 16 gm) revealed the highest gap. Significance. Form-congruence between the preparation <b>drill</b> and the <b>post</b> systems exhibited differences. The most consistent cement gap either at the coronal, middle or apical parts of the root canals was obtained with the Erlangen post system (R). (c) 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.
