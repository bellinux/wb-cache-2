5|$|The <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> {{there were}} three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber?

If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E

On April 28, the trial's presiding judge, Loretta Preska, ruled that the NBA must supply the internal documents about the possible relocation of the Sonics that the city of Seattle had requested. In addition, the <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that Stern could be deposed at a later day should the need arise.
