40|$|In this article, {{we address}} {{the current state}} and general role of {{replication}} in empirical sciences in general and music psychology in particular. We argue that replication should {{be an integral part}} of the quality management of science because it helps to improve and maintain the general benefit of empirical sciences by enhancing the confidence in scientific phenomena and theories. Replicating empirical experiments has two major benefits: (1) It increases the sheer number of observations and (2) it provides independent evidence which works as a safety net against methodological fallacies, causally influential but unknown (i. e., random) factors, researcher degrees of freedom, and outright fraud. Furthermore, we argue that for low-gain/low-cost sciences such as music psychology, measures to ensure quality standards, in particular the amount of replication experiments conducted, can be expected to be lower than in high gain/high cost sciences. These lower expectations stem from the <b>general</b> <b>acknowledgments</b> that in low-gain/lowcost sciences (1) research resources are normally scarce and (2) the consequences of inadequate theories are relatively harmless. We argue that the view of music psychology as a low-cost/low-gain science can explain the striking lack of replication studies and meta-analyses. We also discuss possible countermeasures to enhance the reliability of music-psychological knowledge...|$|E

40|$|The model {{developed}} for the nigh temperature CVD of TiB 2 appears applicable to CVD systems operated under conditions in which chemical kinetic processes are rapid in comparison to gaseous diffusion. Mass trans-port models, {{such as the one}} discussed in the present paper, can be quantitatively applied to other CVD sys-tems. The model presented here is simple, however, and involves a significant number of assumptions. The assumptions include the use of a simple expression for the binary diffusion coefficient, even though t e present system contains more than two gaseous pecies. Hydro-gen was generally present in excess, so the approxima-tion that he other species are diffusing through pure hydrogen is probably good. The model also considers the boundary layer thickness to vary in a manner simi-lar to that for flow across a semi-infinite fiat plate. The conclusions about the rate-l imiting mechanisms and the effect of the deposition parameters on the de-posit character made it possible to develop a prel imi-nary model of the deposition processes.

40|$|Despite the <b>general</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> of {{the role}} of niche and fitness {{differences}} in community dynamics, species abundance has been coined as a relevant feature not just regarding niche perspectives, but also according to neutral perspectives. Here we explore a minimum probabilistic stochastic model to evaluate the role of populations relative initial and total abundances on species chances to outcompete each other and their persistence in time (i. e., unstable coexistence). The present results show that taking into account the stochasticity in demographic properties and conservation of individuals in closed communities (zero-sum assumption), population initial abundance can strongly influence species chances to outcompete each other, and also influence the period of coexistence of these species in a particular time interval. Systems carrying capacity can have an important role in species coexistence by exacerbating fitness inequalities and affecting the size of the period of coexistence. This study also shows that populations initial abundances can act as an equalizing mechanism, reducing fitness inequalities, which can favor species coexistence and even make less fitted species to be more likely to outcompete better fitted species, and thus to dominate ecological communities in the absence of niche mechanisms.

The Health Measurement Questionnaire (HMQ) has been developed as a way of collecting self-report information from which a disability/distress rating could be derived on the Rosser Classification of Illness States. This discussion paper provides a fuller review of the data collected as part of a general population survey in which the HMQ was used as a self-report measure of health status alongside the GHQ and the NHP. The HMQ appears to have both construct and convergent validity. It has also discriminated between groups of the population which differ in terms of health status or in the degree of psychiatric morbidity.

The king of León, Alfonso V, decreed the Fuero de León (1017), considered the earliest laws governing territorial and local life, as it applied to the entire kingdom, with certain provisions {{for the city of}} León. The various Basque provinces also generally regarded their fueros also known as jauntxos as tantamount to a municipal constitution. This view was accepted by some others, including President of the United States John Adams. He cited the Biscayan fueros as a precedent for the United States Constitution. (Adams, A defense…, 1786) [...] This view regards fueros as granting or acknowledging rights. In the contrasting view, fueros were privileges granted by a monarch. In the letter Adams also commented on the substantial independence of the hereditary Basque Jauntxo families as the origin for their privileges. In practice, distinct fueros for specific classes, estates, towns, or regions usually arose out of feudal power politics.

To use growth as a component of formula evaluation, it is necessary to select a reference pop-ulation, and there is an ongoing debate about which of several reference populations is most suitable. On first consideration, the breastfed infant may seem a logical choice as a reference. It can be pointed out that the lactation process has been modified by evolutionary forces over millions of years, and hu-man milk is generally agreed to be the model for development of infant formulas. Nowhere is the su-periority of human milk over infant formula more clearly evident than in protection against infection. The major antiinfective components of human milk have not been incorporated into currently available infant formulas, and there is little likelihood that this will occur in the future. Nevertheless, based on an argument that will be presented, the overwhelming evidence that breastfeeding is the preferred way to nourish infants does not logically lead to the conclu-sion that data on growth of breastfed infants are suitable for assessment of growth of formula-fed in-fants...|$|R

In any community there are many different "publics" with many different informational needs and demands. The individual library user probably belongs to several groups, e. g., he is a citizen, a father of a family, a businessman, and an amateur musician. His need for information may vary from details of a purely factual type as a date or address, to a question which requires the use of the library's whole resources on a certain subject and the borrowing of material not in the library.

60|$|Among the {{impediments to}} the <b>general</b> <b>acknowledgment,</b> by {{thoughtful}} minds, of the subjection of historical facts to scientific laws, {{the most fundamental}} continues to be that which is grounded on the doctrine of Free Will, or, in other words, on the denial that the law of invariable Causation holds true of human volitions; for if it does not, the course of history, being the result of human volitions, {{can not be a}} subject of scientific laws, since the volitions on which it depends can neither be foreseen, nor reduced to any canon of regularity even after they have occurred. I have discussed this question, as far as seemed suitable to the occasion, in a former chapter; and I only think it necessary to repeat, that the doctrine of the Causation of human actions, improperly called the doctrine of Necessity, affirms no mysterious nexus, or overruling fatality: it asserts only that men’s actions are the joint result of the general laws and circumstances of human nature, and of their own particular characters; those characters again being the consequence of the natural and artificial circumstances that constituted their education, among which circumstances must be reckoned their own conscious efforts. Any one who is willing to take (if the expression may be permitted) the trouble of thinking himself into the doctrine as thus stated, will find it, I believe, not only a faithful interpretation of the universal experience of human conduct, but a correct representation of the mode in which he himself, in every particular case, spontaneously interprets his own experience of that conduct.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Due to {{the rising}} number of patient reports in pharmacovigilance, {{the manner in which}} {{feedback}} is provided to patients is an element to be considered. The objective is to explore the satisfaction of patients towards personalized and general feedback in response to their reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs). METHODS: Patients who reported an ADR to the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Centre {{for the first time in}} the period between October 2012 and April 2013 were included. Reporters received personalized feedback or a general acknowledgement letter. Satisfaction towards the received feedback, expressed on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 very good to 5 very poor), was studied using a web-based questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson Chi-square test and linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was based on p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 471 patient-reporters were contacted with a total response of 52. 5 %. Respondents of both groups were satisfied with the received feedback, average score 2 (good). Respondents of the personalized feedback-group were however more satisfied score 2. 0 versus 2. 5 (p < 0. 001) and considered the feedback more clear and useful compared with respondents of the acknowledgement letter-group, respectively score 1. 6 versus 1. 7 (p = 0. 01) and score 2. 1 versus 2. 5 (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Patients reporting ADRs are satisfied with feedback received from the pharmacovigilance centre, whether this is a personalized feedback or a <b>general</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> letter.
