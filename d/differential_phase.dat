25|$|By {{recording}} several images {{at different}} detuning angles, meaning at different {{positions on the}} rocking curve, a data set is gained which allows the retrieval of quantitative <b>differential</b> <b>phase</b> information.

25|$|In media termed birefringent, {{in which}} the amplitudes are {{unchanged}} but a <b>differential</b> <b>phase</b> delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a unitary matrix: |g1| = |g2| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or dichroic {{in the sense of}} polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a Hermitian matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since any matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.|$|E
40|$|Astronomical optical interferometers (OI) {{sample the}} Fourier {{transform}} of the intensity distribution of a source at the observation wavelength.

40|$|Considering {{multiple}} interferograms is {{a common}} practice in SAR differential interferometry. In fact, multitemporal SAR acquisitions are used for monitoring terrain displacements {{over a long period}} of time. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets can help reducing atmospheric artifacts in SAR interferometric measurements. Given a series of SAR acquisitions, when all the interferograms between consecutive dates are computed, consecutive <b>differential</b> <b>phases</b> (after phase unwrapping) can be simply summed to obtain the <b>differential</b> <b>phases</b> correspondent to all the possible time intervals (including the total one). More generally, to this goal it is not necessary that all the computed interferograms are time-consecutive, but it suffices that the <b>differential</b> <b>phases</b> of each possible time interval can be obtained through a linear combination of the computed ones, i. e. by the solution of a determined linear system of equations. It is common in typical cases (e. g. with ERS data), that not all the interferograms necessary to the goal above can be computed, unless one accepts that only few pixels (corresponding to point-like scatterers) remain coherent. In fact, spatial and temporal baselines can be very large. So, an under-determined linear system of equations is in generally available. Previous works proposed to solve this system by singular value decomposition, i. e., by assuming that the solution (i. e. the terrain displacement) has minimum velocity. In this work, a different assumption is exploited in order to find a determined solution to the problem of combining SAR multi-temporal differential interferometric measurements. The proposed approach is based on the idea that the solution should have minimum curvature. Tests performed on simulated and ERS real data confirm the validity of the method. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{birefringent}} media {{there is}} no attenuation but two modes accrue a <b>differential</b> <b>phase</b> delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical wave plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change unless its polarization direction is identical {{to one of those}} basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.|$|E
25|$|One can {{visualize}} {{the case of}} linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a <b>differential</b> <b>phase</b> starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.|$|E

40|$|Context. Spectrally {{resolved}} long-baseline optical/IR interferometry of rotating stars opens perspectives {{to investigate}} their fundamental parameters {{and the physical}} mechanisms that govern their interior, photosphere, and circumstellar envelope structures. Aims. Based on the signatures of stellar rotation on observed interferometric wavelength-differential phases, we aim to measure angular diameters, rotation velocities, and orientation of stellar rotation axes. Methods. We used the AMBER focal instrument at ESO-VLTI in its high-spectral resolution mode to record interferometric data on the fast rotator Achernar. <b>Differential</b> <b>phases</b> centered on the hydrogen Br gamma line (K band) were obtained during four almost consecutive nights with a continuous Earth-rotation synthesis during similar to 5 h/night, corresponding to similar to 60 degrees position angle coverage per baseline. These observations were interpreted with our numerical code dedicated to long-baseline interferometry of rotating stars. Results. By fitting our model to Achernar's <b>differential</b> <b>phases</b> from AMBER, we could measure its equatorial radius R-eq = 11. 6 +/- 0. 3 R-circle dot, equatorial rotation velocity V-eq = 298 +/- 9 km s(- 1), rotation axis inclination angle i = 101. 5 +/- 5. 2 degrees, and rotation axis position angle (from North to East) PA(rot) = 34. 9 +/- 1. 6 degrees. From these parameters and the stellar distance, the equatorial angular diameter circle divide(eq) of Achernar {{is found to be}} 2. 45 +/- 0. 09 mas, which is compatible with previous values derived from the commonly used visibility amplitude. In particular, circle divide(eq) and PA(rot) measured in this work with VLTI/AMBER are compatible with the values previously obtained with VLTI/VINCI. Conclusions. The present paper, based on real data, demonstrates the super-resolution potential of differential interferometry for measuring sizes, rotation velocities, and orientation of rotating stars in cases where visibility amplitudes are unavailable and/or when the star is partially or poorly resolved. In particular, we showed that <b>differential</b> <b>phases</b> allow the measurement of sizes up to similar to 4 times smaller than the diffraction-limited angular resolution of the interferometer.
