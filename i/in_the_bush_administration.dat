25|$|Rumsfeld's second {{tenure as}} Secretary of Defense {{cemented}} {{him as the}} most powerful Pentagon chief since Robert McNamara {{and one of the most}} influential Cabinet members <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b> His tenure would prove to be a pivotal and rocky one which led the United States military into the 21st century.
