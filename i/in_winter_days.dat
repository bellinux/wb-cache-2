60|$|For {{sounds in}} winter nights, and often <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days,</b> I heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a {{suitable}} plectrum, the very lingua vernacula of Walden Wood, and quite {{familiar to me}} at last, though I never saw the bird while it was making it. I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it; Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo, sounded sonorously, and the first three syllables accented somewhat like how der do; or sometimes hoo, hoo only. One night {{in the beginning of}} winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o'clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods, responded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from Hudson's Bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native, and boo-hoo him out of Concord horizon. What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself? Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!

6000|$|In like manner, {{there is}} {{throughout}} nature something mocking, something that leads us on and on, but arrives nowhere; keeps no faith with us. All promise outruns the performance. We {{live in a}} system of approximations. Every end is prospective of some other end, which is also temporary; a round and final success nowhere. We are encamped in nature, not domesticated. Hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink; but bread and wine, mix and cook them how you will, leave us hungry and thirsty, after the stomach is full. It is the same with all our arts and performances. Our music, our poetry, our language itself are not satisfactions, but suggestions. The hunger for wealth, which reduces the planet to a garden, fools the eager pursuer. What is the end sought? Plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty, from the intrusion of deformity or vulgarity of any kind. But what an operose method! What a train of means to secure a little conversation! This palace of brick and stone, these servants, this kitchen, these stables, horses and equipage, this bank-stock and file of mortgages; trade to all the world, country-house and cottage by the waterside, all for a little conversation, high, clear, and spiritual! Could it not be had as well by beggars on the highway? No, all these things came from successive efforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life, and give opportunity. Conversation, character, were the avowed ends; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney, silenced the creaking door, brought friends together in a warm and quiet room, and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment. Thought, virtue, beauty, were the ends; but it was known that men of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache, or wet feet, or could lose good time whilst the room was getting warm <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days.</b> Unluckily, in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences, the main attention has been diverted to this object; the old aims have been lost sight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end. That is the ridicule of rich men, and Boston, London, Vienna, and now the governments generally of the world are cities and governments of the rich; and the masses are not men, but poor men, that is, men who would be rich; this is the ridicule of the class, that they arrive with pains and sweat and fury nowhere; when all is done, it is for nothing. They are like one who has interrupted the conversation of a company to make his speech, and now has forgotten what he went to say. The appearance strikes the eye everywhere of an aimless society, of aimless nations. Were the ends of nature so great and cogent as to exact this immense sacrifice of men? ...|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid and}} {{unsustainable}} urbanization process causes a serious existing thermal environmental problem that aggravates climatic change and generates a higher temperature in urban area than in rural area. Based on literature review, {{this is the}} first research that uses field measurement methodology to investigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Hangzhou and Ningbo cities of Zhejiang Province. This study aims to investigate reciprocal interaction of UHI effect with urban building energy based on the air temperature and relative humidity measurement in research area. There are three main factors including vegetation cover, urban building configuration and surface material properties, and human activities, contributing to the UHI development. Through using ENVI-met simulation, the study has investigated how the West Lake and the Xixi Wetland ecological areas in the city act as passive thermal comfort systems in improving the outdoor built environment and mitigating UHI effect. However, according to the observation, the UHI effect in Hangzhou is still more intense than that in Ningbo. The monthly average UHII values in Hangzhou ranged between 1 ℃ and 4 ℃, whilst the highest monthly average UHII in Ningbo is only as high as 1. 5 ℃. Additionally, the study has evaluated that the UHI effect is most pronounce <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days,</b> because there is serious air pollution, high concentration of Particulate Matter (PM) and low wind speed <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days</b> in China. The result has also proved that the night time UHI effect is significantly more intense than the day time UHI effect. It has been validated in the study that UHI effect can be mitigated by three effective strategies, such as the application of cool materials on urban surfaces, modifying urban geometry to improve wind flow and expanding green space in urban areas. Owing to the hourly air temperature and relative humidity collected from strategically selected sites around the city, modified TMY weather dataset has been established. The research employed a case study of China Telecom Business Office Building in Hangzhou to evaluate the impact of UHI on urban building energy consumption. It implies that there is about 20...|$|E

Four experimental campaigns were organised in February, July, October and December, 2012. The sampling of 24 hour average concentration was performed by TECORA sampler on quartz filters according to the European Standards. ED-XRF technique was applied to determine more than 20 macro and micro elements from phosphorus to lead in the PM 10 filter samples. The measured PM 10 daily concentrations are, in general, higher in the winter season. In February they range from 17. 7 to 160. 1 μg. m- 3, compared to the lower summer values of 15. 5 - 42. 7 μg. m- 3 in July. In October PM 10 varies from 8. 43 to 78. 3 μg. m- 3.

40|$|The solar chimney {{power plant}} (SCPP) is {{dominated}} by the solar radiation, and therefore its discontinuous operation is an unavoidable problem. In this paper, low temperature geothermal water is introduced into the SCPP for overcoming this problem. Based on a developed transient model, theoretical analyses are carried out to investigate the performance of the geothermal-{{solar chimney power plant}} (GSCPP) with main dimensions the same as the Manzanares prototype in Spain. Three operation models, viz. the full solar model, the full geothernial model and the geothermal-solar combined model are compared in typical summer and winter days and throughout the year. It is found that the GSCPP can attractively run in the GSM to deliver power continuously. Due to the ambient-dependant geothermal water outlet temperature, introducing the geothermal water makes greater contribution <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days</b> than in summer days, in the night than in the daytime. Power generation under GSM is larger than the sum of FSM and FGM. GSM is not the simple superposition of FSM and FGM, but makes better utilization of solar and geothermal energy. In addition, introducing high temperature and mass flow rate geothermal water can doubled and redoubled improve the GSCPP's power capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In case of DMT standard deviations of summer days are less than of winter days, while in case of DTR spring and autumn days have greater values of this parameter. Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality tests reveal that in almost cases time series follow a normal distribution, but some other test (e. g. Shapiro-Wilk) show that in winter there are time series of days in which case one cannot assume normality. By far most outliers were found <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> <b>days</b> (e. g. 15 outliers were registered in 1985, {{which is one of}} the coldest years). Linear trend was analysed using Mann-Kendall test. In case of DMT statistical significant increasing trends are present in greater numbers in days of warm months (e. g. in August there are 10 such days), which is similar to monthly linear trends. In order to decide whether a time series have constant variance or not, range-mean plots were created. Mainly downward sloping lines are present, e. g. in January (DMT) there are 15 days when the variance is decreasing in the mean. Two parts regressions have different points (year) when the regression line is changing, but usually the second line has an upward slope. In case of extreme temperatures (TN and TX) 1 st and 3 rd quartiles were determined, and analysed how the number of values greater respectively less than the quartiles is distributed in time. So for example, in case of summer days (TN) two thirds of values greater than 3 rd quartile are placed in the second parts of studied periods, while in winter half parts of values greater than the 1 st quartile are placed in the last 32 years.

Foram coletados dados de fevereiro a novembro de 2005; utilizou-se coletor de dados computadorizado da Campbell Scientific INC., que possibilitou adquirir e armazenar os dados de irradiância solar no plano do painel, tensão e corrente gerada, temperatura no painel e vazão. Por meio de cálculos, obtiveram-se os valores de potência e eficiência do sistema. O solstício de inverno apresentou eficiência de 9, 58 % com bombeamento diário de 2. 056 litros, enquanto o solstício de verão apresentou eficiência de 9, 07 % com bombeamento diário de 2. 377 litros. A maior eficiência nos dias de inverno está ligada às menores temperaturas se comparada aos dias de verão, e o fator que provocou a maior vazão de água bombeada nos dias de verão está atrelado ao tempo de insolação, que é maior se comparado aos dias de inverno.
