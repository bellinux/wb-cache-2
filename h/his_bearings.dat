5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose <b>his</b> <b>bearings,</b> and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
25|$|On 21 December 1978, Cessna 188 pilot Jay Prochnow radioed in a Mayday call to {{air traffic}} control. Prochnow, {{previously}} a {{pilot in the}} United States Navy, had lost <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> on a flight from Pago Pago to Norfolk Island when his Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) malfunctioned. At the same time, Gordon Vette was serving as captain of ANZ Flight 103 from Fiji to Auckland (with his first officer Arthur Dovey and flight engineer Gordon Brooks), making him the closest person to Prochnow that air traffic control could find. Vette agreed {{to help in the}} search for the lost Cessna.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid is {{introduced}} in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house {{after they have been}} murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about {{the fact that it was}} Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher’s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron’s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.|$|E

500|$|The final {{replacement}} game {{featured a}} Vikings team {{with none of}} its regular players, facing a Buccaneers team with only center Dan Turk crossing the picket line. Tampa Bay took a 17–10 lead in the third quarter, after Kevin Walker's 30-yard interception return and Arthur Wells' end-zone fumble recovery. [...] The Buccaneers' offensive output was limited to two field goals. Jim Zorn had been signed to replace the struggling John Reaves. Zorn also struggled, committing three early turnovers, but got <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> and wound up 20–36 for 199yards. The week was marked by sluggish work during practices. The players, {{some of whom were}} facing pressure to return to their regular jobs, were uncertain over whether they would have a game to play in by the time Sunday arrived.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few months {{interest}} in the search waned, but Hindley's clue had directed the police to focus their efforts on a specific area. On the afternoon of 1 July 1987, after more than 100days of searching, they found a body buried [...] below the surface, only [...] from the place where Lesley Ann Downey had been found. Brady had been co-operating with the police for some time, and when news reached him that Reade's body had been discovered he made a formal confession to Topping. He also issued a statement to the press, through his solicitor, saying that he too was prepared to help the police in their search. Brady was taken to the moor on 3 July, but he seemed to lose <b>his</b> <b>bearings,</b> blaming changes that had taken place in the intervening years, and the search was called off at 3:00 pm, by which time a large crowd of press and television reporters had gathered on the moor.|$|E

For Lacan, with [...] "masculine knowledge irredeemably an erring", the individual [...] "must thus allow himself to be fooled by these signs {{to have a chance}} of getting <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> amidst them; he must place and maintain himself {{in the wake of a}} discourse... become the dupe of a discourse... les non-dupes errent".|$|E
2500|$|Keith (Bill Hader) {{writes a}} letter to his sister, as Dave (Andy Samberg) asks what he is doing. As Keith responds, {{explaining}} he hasn't seen his sister in a long time, Dave suddenly and inexplicably shoots him. In the following overly dramatic, slow-motion death overdubbed by a cue of [...] "Hide and Seek" [...] by Imogen Heap, Dave is seen visibly shaken as Keith, in shock, collapses. As Dave gathers <b>his</b> <b>bearings,</b> Keith suddenly shoots him in return, having recovered from his injury long enough to exact his revenge to the same music cue.|$|E
2500|$|The men marched [...] through forest before {{emerging}} into prairie. When a guide {{announced that}} he was lost, Clark suspected treachery and threatened to kill the man unless he found the way. The guide regained <b>his</b> <b>bearings,</b> and the trek resumed. They arrived outside Kaskaskia on the night of July 4. Thinking they would have arrived sooner, the men had carried only four days worth of rations; they had gone without food for the last two days of the six-day march. [...] "In our hungry condition," [...] wrote Joseph Bowman, [...] "we unanimously determined to take the town or die in the attempt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although various poems evoke Murcia, Oxford and Manhattan, [...] "Luz natal" [...] {{contains}} {{the only place}} name {{in the whole of}} Cántico, el cerro de San Cristóbal, a hill outside Valladolid which he visited in 1949 to see his sick father. [...] It is a meditation on the significance of this place, from which he began his journey towards reality and from which he still takes <b>his</b> <b>bearings.</b> [...] It adds a new dimension to Guillén’s poetry – history. [...] The protagonist is also a product of history and he has {{to come to terms with}} the good and the bad sides of his culture’s history, just as he has to accept the good and bad of the reality that faces him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company had}} managed to keep hold {{of two of the}} five {{surviving}} Drachen and managed to produce a new example at Tempelhof in February 1945. Almost immediately it was ordered on a [...] "special order from the Führer" [...] to fly to Danzig on 25 February. [...] Flown by Gerstenhauer and two copilots, the Drache took off from Tempelhof the next day. It first headed southwest in the direction of Würzburg. Gerstenhauer lost <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> in the bad weather and had to land at Crailsheim. Once the weather improved, they set off again and landed at Würzburg to refuel, reaching Meiningen, where it stopped overnight. [...] The next day it set off northeast the next day and flew to Werder, a distance of [...] On the third day the Drache continued towards Stettin-Altdamm, but the bad weather again forced them to land, this time at Prenzlau. They attempted to resume the flight the next day, but the weather remained bad and they had to stop at Stolp, west of Danzig, for the night.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1840, Colonel Harney {{finally got}} revenge for his humiliation on the Caloosahatchee River. He led ninety men into the Everglades from Fort Dallas on the Miami River, {{traveling}} in canoes {{borrowed from the}} Marines. They were guided by a black man named John {{who had been in}} Seminole captivity for a while. The column encountered some Indians in canoes and gave chase, catching some of them and promptly hanging the men. When John was having trouble finding the way, Harney tried to force the captured Seminole women to lead the way to the camp, reportedly by threatening to hang their children. However, John got <b>his</b> <b>bearings</b> again and the Harney party found the camp of Chakaika and the 'Spanish Indians'. Dressed as Indians, the soldiers approached the camp early in the morning, achieving surprise. Chakaika was outside the camp when the attack started. He started to run and then stopped and turned to face the soldiers, offering his hand, but one of the soldiers shot and killed him. There was a brief fight during which some of the Indians escaped. [...] Harney had two of the captured warriors hanged, and had Chakaika's body hung beside them. Harney and his men returned to Fort Dallas after twelve days in the Everglades. Harney had lost one soldier killed. His command had killed four Indians in action and hanged five more. The Legislative Council of Florida presented Harney with a commendation and a sword, and Harney was soon given command of the Second Dragoons.|$|E
