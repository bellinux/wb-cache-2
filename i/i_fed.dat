500|$|Hill contributed {{her voice}} to the soundtrack for What Happened, Miss Simone?, a 2015 {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>fed</b> on this music ... I believed I always had a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift." [...] NPR critically praised Hill's performance on the soundtrack, stating: [...] "This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill's breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill's comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998." ...|$|E
2500|$|American {{rock band}} Guns N' Roses {{recorded}} Manson's [...] "Look at Your Game, Girl", included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album [...] "The Spaghetti Incident?" [...] "My Monkey", which appears on Portrait of an American Family by Marilyn Manson (no relation, as is explained below), includes the lyrics [...] "I {{had a little}} monkey / I {{sent him to the}} country and <b>I</b> <b>fed</b> him on gingerbread / Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo / And now my monkey's dead." [...] These lyrics are from Manson's [...] "Mechanical Man", which is heard on [...] Crispin Glover covered [...] "Never Say 'Never' To Always" [...] on his album The Big Problem ≠ The Solution. The Solution = Let It Be released in 1989. Transgressive punk rock performance artist GG Allin covered [...] "Garbage Dump" [...] (from LIE) on his album You Give Love A Bad Name.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variant of}} {{redundancy}} theory is the disquotational theory {{which uses a}} modified form of Tarski's schema: To say that '"P" [...] is true' {{is to say that}} P. [...] A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams in his book What is Truth?. [...] Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. [...] They argue that sentences like [...] "That's true", when said in response to [...] "It's raining", are prosentences, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. [...] In the same way that it means the same as my dog in the sentence My dog was hungry, so <b>I</b> <b>fed</b> it, That's true is supposed to mean the same as It's raining—if you say the latter and I then say the former. [...] These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion [...] "P" [...] may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as [...] "that's true." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{find out}} how the ileum adapts to total {{parenteral}} feeding, two experiments were performed. In the first experiment rats were given total intravenous feeding for 10 days. The animals were injected with tritiated thymidine (1 muCi/g body weight) 1 hour before being killed. Portions of the ileum were used for (1) radioautography, (2) analysis of the tissue DNA content, (3) specific activity of the DNA, and (4) scanning electron microscopy. The DNA content of ileum was decreased 72 % while the specific activity of DNA was increased 289 % in the <b>i.</b> v. <b>fed</b> rats. In the second experiment rats were given total intravenous feeding for 10 days. The animal were injected with colchicine (1 mg/kg body weight) 3 hours before being killed. The number of labelled cell nuclei per ileal crypt section was significantly decreased by parenteral feeding as was the number of colchicine collected metaphase figures. Light microscopy revealed the crypt and the villus height to be shorter and the number of goblet cells per unit surface area to be increased in parenterally fed rats as compared to those fed solid food orally. Enterocytes of the exfoliative zone from the ileal villi of rats fed solid food showed three distinct types of surface architecture whereas those from <b>i.</b> v. <b>fed</b> rats all possessed abundant microvilli. No bacteria were seen in ilea of <b>i.</b> v. <b>fed</b> animals but many were seen embedded in enterocytes from orally fed rats. Because the amount of DNA per cell is known to be constant, we concluded that the overall number of cells in the lieum decreased about 72 % in the <b>i.</b> v. <b>fed</b> rats and that cell proliferation in the crypts, although significantly deceased, was still supporting an epithelial renewal process...|$|R
60|$|So {{it is not}} in the Desert. One came to me weeping-- The Avenger of Blood on his track--I {{took him}} in keeping. Demanding not whom he had slain, I {{refreshed}} him, <b>I</b> <b>fed</b> him As he were even a brother. But Eblis had bred him.|$|E
