Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as [...] "he is the best".

Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants [...] "to be a singer who can be good at both singing and rapping like [...] ".

500|$|Wonderland is {{a concept}} album loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. The album took the title from the book, and was created with the {{intention}} of taking listeners on a journey, as well as showcasing Smith's voice. She said that [...] "that's something I like to hear in music. Whether <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Beyonce or Vivaldi, music is supposed to transport you away, escape from the everyday."

500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a lot of pop, but <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think all that stuff shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute.

500|$|Public {{reaction}} to Yeezus, including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion {{as well as}} its brash and aggressive sound, was mixed. Yeezus was noted {{as one of the most}} anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications, but the lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move. Regardless, radio stations have still played tracks from Yeezus on air, despite it being a departure from the normal playlists found on hip-hop stations. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more," [...] stated West at his headlining June 9, 2013 Governor's Ball performance, where he unveiled several tracks from the record for the first time.

The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice.

[...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys.

[...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody wants to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} all that <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> and that is not all that I want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering.

[...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E

500|$|Treasury Secretary Mellon also {{recommended}} to Congress that {{income tax rates}} be cut. He asked that the excess profits tax on corporations be abolished. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who wanted to raise tax rates on corporations, fought the measure.

Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
500|$|Slap-Happy was {{considered}} more varied than previous L7 albums. Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous releases, {{as seen in the}} tracks [...] "On My Rockin' Machine", [...] "Long Green" [...] and [...] "Mantra Down", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like [...] "Livin' Large" [...] and [...] "Freezer Burn". The former song was described by Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone as [...] "a kind of rallying cry for the indie-rock underclass", while the latter was seen as a melodic song that [...] "juxtaposes harsh words delivered in mellow, floating vocals." [...] Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song [...] "Little One" [...] contains elements of both polka and country music. As Sparks noted, [...] "We're all into all kinds of music, but <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> very little rock, actually. Our approach was to pretty much do what we've always done, but we're not concerned with sticking with a particular style. There's diversity in our songwriting." ...|$|E
