25|$|There was a {{widespread}} feeling that emergency rooms were misused for non-emergency medical care (the misuse was and <b>is</b> <b>undeniable,</b> {{not unique to}} Massachusetts, and continues; the relation to healthcare insurance {{or lack of it}} was less clear and apparently did/does not exist).|$|E
25|$|Though there <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> {{proof of}} their {{existence}} {{and use of the}} cave, {{there is no evidence of}} further use past the archaic period. Experts and scientists have no answer as to why this is, making it one of the greatest mysteries of Mammoth Cave to this day.|$|E

25|$|Hopper's {{influence}} on the art world and pop culture <b>is</b> <b>undeniable.</b> Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including Willem de Kooning, Jim Dine, and Mark Rothko. An illustration of Hopper's influence is Rothko's early work Composition I (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper's Chop Suey.|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{problems}} were soluble has been contentious ever since. What <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> is that the PRR very soon did not care; the much easier solution of the diesel locomotive was taken within months of the production locomotives being delivered, and within 2 years all principal passenger trains were diesel-hauled. The T1s spent {{a few more years}} in lesser service before being withdrawn in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Soda Stereo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} and influential rock band in Spanish ever. The influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even 'business acumen' <b>is</b> <b>undeniable.</b> They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as The Police, Television, and Talking Heads, and by symphonic rockers Luis Alberto Spinetta and Aquelarre.|$|E

25|$|If the {{quicksilver}} {{is poured}} into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, {{and put on}} a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{linguists}} – Meillet, Klimas, Zinkevičius – {{oppose this}} view, providing arguments against a Balto-Slavic group, and explaining those similarities {{by one or}} several periods of close contacts. There exist a number of Baltic words {{that are similar to}} Sanskrit or Latin and which lack counterparts in Slavic languages. Latvian, Lithuanian, Armenian, Albanian, Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages are grouped as satem languages. While the possession of many archaic features <b>is</b> <b>undeniable,</b> the exact manner by which the Baltic languages have developed from the Proto-Indo-European language is not clear.|$|E
25|$|Scholars such as Ulrich Luz and {{separately}} Dale Allison {{view the}} pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians. Alan Robinson sees the pericope {{as important in}} establishing {{the belief in the}} early Church that the disciples viewed Jesus as the Son of God. Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that God the Father is willing to share divine power with his son and that the impact of this pericope on the affirmation of the divinity of Jesus in the ecumenical creeds <b>is</b> <b>undeniable.</b>|$|E

25|$|These {{elements}} of inaction tempered the information {{according to which}} the United States would have armed the Rwanda Patriotic Front of Paul Kagame. If it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> that Paul Kagame followed the military training of the United States {{in his capacity as}} an Ugandan officer, it is probable that he would have benefited from Anglo-American aid via Uganda, this endorsement {{does not appear to be}} as large or determined as that that was received from the outside of those who he fought: the army of the regime of President Habyarimana and then the interim government which led the genocide.|$|E
25|$|This {{difference}} {{is one of}} the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as Match.com, Yahoo Personals, and eHarmony.com are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like MySpace and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{was never}} a {{particularly}} attractive destination for migrants, owing to its remoteness and distance from Europe. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long journey through the Straits of Magellan or crossing the Andes. European migration {{did not result in}} a significant change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan. Spaniards were the only major European migrant group to Chile, and there was never large-scale immigration such as that to Argentina or Uruguay. Between 1851 and 1924, Chile only received 0.5% of European immigration to Latin America, compared to 46% to Argentina, 33% to Brazil, 14% to Cuba, and 4% to Uruguay. However, it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> that immigrants have {{played a significant role in}} Chilean society.|$|E

25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable,</b> the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina {{there are}} {{public and private}} medical schools, however the {{prestige}} of the public institutions <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> and the private institutions do not normally appear in international rankings. A person who can afford to attend a private university, quite expensive for the average Argentinian, will choose that option over public education because of the smaller groups of students in each class and {{because of the lack of}} strictness in course evaluation. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free to all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly forbidden from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in case, in 2016 La Universidad Nacional de la Plata was obligated by the governing bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a result, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its student population. When it comes to educational quality, la Universidad de Buenos Aires, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical school in the country.|$|E
25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) <b>is</b> <b>undeniable,</b> but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E
50|$|Writing for Exclaim, Calum Slingerland {{noted that}} while the record is more focused compositionally than its predecessor, Conditions of My Parole, the {{increased}} presence of vocalist Carina Round and the consistent desert-weary feel of the work <b>are</b> <b>undeniable</b> positives.|$|R
40|$|Pesticides are {{synthetic}} chemicals {{widely used}} for protecting crops from pests.

50|$|Mozart {{arrives in}} Vienna {{to perform at}} the request of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg (Nicholas Kepros). Salieri attends the {{performance}} to meet Mozart, only to be disappointed when he discovers Mozart to be obscene and immature. Despite this, Salieri finds Mozart's talent to <b>be</b> <b>undeniable.</b>|$|R
500|$|Billboard magazine's Jason Lipshutz {{described}} {{that the}} record [...] "succeeds in mixing its safer stylistic choices with its relatively bold ideas". BBC Music's Matthew Horton {{said that the}} captivating album showcases the singer's knack for songs with chart potential, while noting the incorporation of rock and soul styles. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe felt Mars [...] "is trying to rough up his image a bit" [...] as it <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> in [...] "his strong, if sometimes oddly lyrically aggressive, second album". Ryan Reed, writing in Paste, gave Unorthodox Jukebox a 7/10 rating, confessing that [...] "Mars still plays the sweetheart card well, but he's proven himself way more interesting as a badass".|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{called the}} {{performance}} [...] "jibe, {{but a more}} celebratory one," [...] while Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture named it [...] "a crowd-pleaser". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick praised {{the fact that the}} singer [...] "sound spontaneous and unscripted and her pleasure in performing <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> and infectious," [...] noticing that [...] "he delighted the London audience [...] for an absurdly improvised funky dance that seems likely to become a YouTube meme." [...] Reviewing the show for The Guardian, Peter Robinson called her performance [...] "relaxed and comfortable". The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena were recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E
500|$|Some {{prominent}} critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 {{review for}} Sur, Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film [...] "a labyrinth with no center" [...] and predicted that its legacy {{would be a}} film [...] "whose historical value <b>is</b> <b>undeniable</b> but which no one cares to see again." [...] The Argus Weekend Magazine critic Erle Cox called the film [...] "amazing" [...] but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was [...] "overdone." [...] Tatlers James Agate called it [...] "the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing one expects from high-brows" [...] and [...] "a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed." [...] Eileen Creelman of The New York Sun called it [...] "a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee.|$|E

60|$|I did so and {{promptly}} produced the brooch. Lord Porthoning's eyes seemed almost {{to start from}} his head. I {{could see that he}} suddenly became limp in Mr. Bundercombe's grasp.

60|$|At length, {{much to my}} relief, my {{aunt and}} Mr. Wickfield came back, after a pretty long absence.
