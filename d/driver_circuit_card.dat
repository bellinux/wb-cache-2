40|$|Low {{temperature}} polysilicon {{thin film}} transistors (Poly-Si TFT) {{have recently been}} used to design integrated <b>driver</b> <b>circuits</b> for active matrix liquid crystal display. Although the performance of Poly-Si TFT is inferior to the conventional single-crystal MOSFET, they have the important advantage of being compatible with fabrication on glass substrate. This can greatly reduce the system cost and increase the long-term reliability. At the present time, there are digital <b>driver</b> <b>circuits</b> realized with gray scale up to 6 bits or 8 bits resolution. This means the number of gray levels for each RGB pixel is limited to 256 levels only. In {{order to have a}} full gray scale colour display, analog <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> is a good candidate. One of the major building blocks in analog <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> is the operational amplifier (opamp). However, the large threshold voltage variation of Poly-Si TFT over a wafer creates the problem of non-uniformity in opamp. In addition, the poor saturation characteristic called “kink effect” also makes it difficult to design of an opamp with good performance. In this research, a new biasing method is introduced to eliminate the effect of threshold voltage variation in the performance of opamp. With the use of a novel “kink free” Poly-Si TFT structure, good performance opamp and other building blocks for analog <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> are designed. In order to predict the performance of the <b>driver</b> <b>circuit,</b> circuit simulation model is needed. However, there is no standardized Poly-Si TFT Spice model available. Therefore, a modified HSPICE model is also developed based on the characteristic of the Poly-Si TFT structure being used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This article {{presents}} a power-efficient low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) output <b>driver</b> <b>circuit.</b> The proposed approach helps {{to reduce the}} total input capacitance of the LVDS <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> and hence relaxes the tradeoffs in designing a low-power pre-driver stage. A slew control technique has also been introduced to reduce the impedance mismatch effect between the output <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> and the line. The pre-driver stage shows a total input capacitance of 50 fF and also controls the voltage swing and common-mode voltage at the input of the LVDS driver output stage. This makes the operation at low supply voltages using a conventional 0. 18 m CMOS technology feasible. The output <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> consumes 4. 5 mA while driving an external 100 resistor with an output voltage swing of 400 mV, achieving a normalized power dissipation of 3. 42 mW/Gbps. The area of the LVDS <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> is 0. 067 mm and the measured output jitter is 4. 5 ps.
