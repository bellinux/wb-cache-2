5|$|The {{original}} hotel tower had 680 rooms, {{and each}} featured {{a room with}} one wall which was fully mirrored <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling. The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, rosewood from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place.|$|E

His place {{was taken by}} Bas Maas, {{who had been the}} guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came <b>from</b> <b>Floor</b> Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.|$|E

25|$|The largest dome in {{the world}} for more than 1,700 years was the Pantheon in Rome. Its {{concrete}} dome spans an interior space of 43.45m, which corresponds exactly to its height <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to top. Its apex concludes with an 8.95m wide oculus. The structure remained unsurpassed until 1881 and stills holds the title of the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome {{in the world}}. The Pantheon has exercised an immense influence on Western dome construction to this day.|$|E
25|$|The spatial diagram {{created by}} TtEias (1979) {{is very similar}} to the sense of space and {{movement}} created in her earlier Tecelares series woodprints. Like Tecelares, the lines of TtEias (1979)are made with simple materials, include geometric shapes, and create movement through the intersection of lines and the creation of space. So too, there is a human element in the use of materials and the production of the work, in which each thread is pulled taut <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling by hand.|$|E
25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling, with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E

25|$|The City of San Mateo {{operates}} three libraries {{within the}} city. The Main Library, the Hillsdale Library, and the Marina Library {{are all part}} of the Peninsula Library System. The Main Library located near Central Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.|$|E
25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling, is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. <b>From</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E

25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling, to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E
25|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the road is Crannagh Park and Road, Rathfarnham Park and Ballytore Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named Tower Court in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of Lord Ely's occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to roof with holes for the pigeons. A floor of more recent date has been inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of one open space with access {{provided by a}} series of recent aluminium-framed doors with fixed glass panels in between. Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to ceiling and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E

25|$|RIMAC Arena is {{the name}} {{used to refer to}} the 186,000 square foot {{building}} that houses both the home arena of the Tritons and the adjacent auxiliary gym. The 44,000 square foot arena itself stands 52 feet tall (45 feet <b>from</b> <b>floor</b> to rafters) and contains six dressing rooms and a 60-by-40-foot-stage, among other facilities. It seats 4,200 spectators in the bleachers for Triton basketball and volleyball home games, expandable to 5,000 through the use of floor seats for concerts. Curtains can divide the facility into five basketball courts that use Robbins Bio-Cushion I flooring. The floor space can also be used for conventions, concerts, trade shows, and other events. In the past, it has hosted training camps for the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers, and Sacramento Kings. Since 2011, concerts have been exclusively booked by Nederlander Concerts.|$|E
