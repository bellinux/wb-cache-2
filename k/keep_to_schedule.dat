2500|$|During his {{preparation}} for The Maltese Falcon, first-time director John Huston planned each {{second of the}} film to the very last detail, tailoring the screenplay with instructions to himself for a shot-for-shot setup, with sketches for every scene, so filming could proceed fluently and professionally. [...] Huston was adamant that the film <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> <b>schedule,</b> and that everything be methodically planned to the fullest {{to ensure that the}} film never went over budget. By providing the cast with a highly detailed script, Huston was able to let them rehearse their scenes with very little intervention.|$|E

5000|$|From 1928 to 1935 {{he was in}} New Zealand making {{films about}} the Māori people. In 1928 he was sent by Carle Laemmle of Universal Studios {{to make a film}} he called Taranga, but did not <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> <b>schedule</b> or make any {{effective}} footage. So the film was made as Under the Southern Cross by Lew Collins.|$|E

500|$|This London {{engagement}} was a {{new experience}} for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production, {{and he had never}} had to memorise lines precisely or <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> <b>schedules</b> enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. The Bing Boys Are Here ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as [...] "the first actor of the halls". He made two films {{towards the end of the}} war: The Anti-frivolity League in 1916 and Doing His Bit the following year.|$|R

50|$|Timekeeper: The {{purpose of}} the {{timekeeper}} is to ensure the decision-making body <b>keeps</b> <b>to</b> the <b>schedule</b> set in the agenda. Effective timekeepers {{use a variety of}} techniques to ensure the meeting runs on time including: giving frequent time updates, ample warning of short time, and keeping individual speakers from taking an excessive amount of time.|$|R
2500|$|The 5700s {{were used}} on GWR for various duties {{including}} shunting, pilot work, and light to medium goods. They {{were also used}} on branch, commuter and shorter mainline passenger trains. They were also used on standby for more powerful locomotives, sometimes producing [...] "firework displays" [...] as they strived <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>schedule</b> with heavier loads.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{meetings}} of the membership. A tradition developed of meeting in both the Spring and Fall of each year, with individual members volunteering to organize and host each meeting. WAML managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> this <b>schedule</b> until recently, when the expense of travelling to meetings rose {{and the amount of}} travel funds from members' institutions was decreasing.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} commercially {{available}} train simulators was Southern Belle, released in 1985. The game simulated a journey of the Southern Belle steam passenger train from London Victoria to Brighton, {{while at the same}} time the player must comply with speed limits, not to go too fast on curves and <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>schedule.</b> It was followed with Evening Star in 1987.|$|R
5000|$|Optimized {{scheduling}} is advantageous {{only as long}} as {{the participants}} <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>schedule</b> by attending the meetings and starting and finishing on time. The latter can be achieved by a school bell or electronic voice-over message played over the school PA system, at each change of interview time (E.g. [...] "Please move to your next interview"), avoiding <b>to</b> <b>schedule</b> very short interview times that are harder <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> running on time, scheduling empty slots at intervals to assist in bringing events back onto time if they are running over. General time management techniques apply.|$|R
5000|$|In 1930 {{he played}} in a variety act {{featuring}} his hit songs with Irish tenor Tom Finglass. The act was a success, but Godfrey could not <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>schedule,</b> and the act soon folded. In the late 1930s his old-fashioned comic song style appealed to movie actor George Formby, Jr. and radio’s [...] "Gert and Daisy". Comedian Max Miller's 1938 film Everything Happens to Me featured two, including the title song.|$|R
50|$|In public transport, bus bunching, clumping, convoying, or {{platooning}} {{refers to}} a group of two or more transit vehicles (such as buses or trains), which were <b>scheduled</b> <b>to</b> be evenly spaced running along the same route, instead running in the same place at the same time. This occurs when {{at least one of the}} vehicles is unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> its <b>schedule</b> and therefore ends up in the same location as one or more other vehicles of the same route at the same time.|$|R
50|$|A work-conserving {{scheduler}} is a scheduler {{that always}} tries <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>scheduled</b> resources busy, {{if there are}} submitted jobs ready <b>to</b> be <b>scheduled.</b> In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle {{despite the presence of}} jobs ready <b>to</b> be <b>scheduled.</b>|$|R

50|$|The clipper {{domination}} {{was challenged}} when , designed by railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, began its first Atlantic service in 1837. She took 15 days {{to cross the}} Atlantic, as compared with two months by sail-powered ships. Unlike the clippers, steamers offered a consistent speed and the ability <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> a <b>schedule.</b> The early steamships still had sails as well, though, as engines at this time had very inefficient consumption of fuel. Having sails enabled vessels like the Great Western {{to take advantage of}} favourable weather conditions and minimise fuel consumption.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s his health declined, {{and he was}} unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> his {{previous}} <b>schedule.</b> He died {{at a hospital in}} nearby North Tarrytown late in 1990. By then the house was showing signs of neglect. The roof was failing, structural wood had begun to rot and the heating system was not running properly, among other problems.|$|R
50|$|Decline {{in the use}} of {{clippers}} {{started with}} the economic slump following the Panic of 1857 and continued with the gradual introduction of the steamship. Although clippers could be much faster than the early steamships, clippers were ultimately dependent on the vagaries of the wind, while steamers could reliably <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> a <b>schedule.</b> The steam clipper was developed around this time, and had auxiliary steam engines which could be used in the absence of wind. An example of this type was the Royal Charter, built in 1857 and wrecked on the coast of Anglesey in 1859.|$|R
5|$|Keene {{had been}} {{persistent}} in her efforts. In 1985 she broke her leg, but managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the feeding <b>schedule</b> even on crutches. In {{the winter of}} 1994 {{she was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and on her doctor's advice underwent a mastectomy. She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do it herself three days after surgery.|$|R
50|$|Azedine Berkane was {{eventually}} permitted {{to leave the}} psychiatric hospital {{where he had been}} a patient after his doctors no longer considered him a threat.

40|$|Music {{composition}} in Italian film {{production of the}} 1950 s demanded high levels of ‘performance’: composers had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> tight <b>schedules,</b> {{the whole process of}} scoring, recording and synchronizing taking approximately 4 - 6 weeks. A. F. Lavagnino developed special techniques aimed at speeding up and increasing the efficiency of his film scores. Drawing on archival music sources, I focus on Lavagnino’s synchronization techniques by discussing his approach to sync points. I focus on his score for the mainstream film The Naked Maja (H. Koster 1958), and on some sequences that were affected by production changes soliciting the composer for readjustments. The comparison with the working process in Othello (O. Welles 1952) allows me to pinpoint significant traits of the evolution in Lavagnino’s approach to film throughout the 1950 s. </p...|$|R
50|$|Like the Produce Express (the name {{given to}} the Grass Grubs used while Endeavour cars assumed duty on the NIMT) before it, steel box wagons built by Addington Workshops between 1978-1982 were towed along at the rear for parcels traffic. The buffet car did not return. As {{this had been a}} change from the red, then green {{carriages}} used since 1981, many in Hawke's Bay started referring to the Wellington-Napier express as the Endeavour once more, although it lacked any of the catering services that the previous Endeavour once provided. However, the train's reliability began to decline; by this stage, the DA class had been withdrawn or converted into the DC class, so under-powered DBR class locomotives hauled the train and struggled <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>scheduled</b> timetable.|$|R

50|$|The Professional Lacrosse League {{developed}} {{out of a}} rift in the North American Lacrosse League, {{which was}} originally <b>scheduled</b> <b>to</b> start play with five teams in January 2012. Weeks before the NALL season was to start, four of the teams - the Charlotte Copperheads, the Hershey Haymakers, the Jacksonville Bullies, and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks - announced that the NALL had relieved acting Commissioner Anthony Caruso of duty and would be switching from a winter <b>to</b> a fall <b>schedule.</b> In turn, Caruso responded that his removal was illegitimate and that he remained {{in charge of the}} NALL, which would <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the winter <b>schedule.</b> The dispute went to litigation, with the result that winter faction kept the NALL name and branding, while the fall faction formed the PLL.|$|R
500|$|Denning {{was also}} known for his long working schedule; when he served as Master of the Rolls he sat for five full days a week, and {{required}} reserved judgments (about one case in ten) to be written during the weekend. He expected the other justices <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the same <b>schedule</b> as him, and was repeatedly warned about overwork.

50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its <b>schedule</b> balanced, the American League {{season was}} {{extended}} by eight games. Previously, teams had played 154 games (22 games per opponent), but from 1961 AL teams would play opponents 18 times each {{for a total}} of 162 games. The National League played a 154 game schedule for the final time in 1961 before switching to 162 games when they also expanded to ten teams for the following season.|$|R
50|$|Dharani Dharan and Shirish, {{who made}} his acting debut with Metro (2016), {{announced}} that they would make a film together during September 2016. The following month, Yuvan Shankar Raja was signed on to work as the music composer, a move which raised {{the profile of the}} project. In late December 2016, Pooja Devariya was signed on to portray the lead female role, while the title was revealed to be Raja Ranguski, {{with the end of the}} name taken from writer Sujatha's pen name and the mosquito's name from Enthiran (2010). Production began during the first week of January, with the team suggesting that they would shoot for two straight months to wrap up filming work. A few days after the shoot began, Devariya was replaced by Chandini Tamilarasan after the former fell ill. The team were not able to delay the shoot and subsequently opted to sign on a new actress <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> their <b>schedule.</b> Anupama Kumar joined the team to essay an important role.|$|R
50|$|Ruth {{also taught}} the gospel groups {{to abide by}} {{theatrical}} rules, such as keeping firm to time limits on stage, as {{they were used to}} singing as long as the spirit hit them in the storefronts. Having to pay stage hands overtime was a major motivation in convincing the gospel groups to confine their performances to the time allotted to them. They also learned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> theatrical <b>schedules,</b> performing their act whether the spirit hit them or not.|$|R
5000|$|Coral Glades {{operated}} under a straight 7 schedule where every student had 7 classes each day. Recently in the 2016/2017 school year, Coral Glades had adopted a block schedule {{in where the}} students schedules are split by [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] days. Each day the students have 4 classes including a study hall period {{one of the two}} days. They have decided <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this <b>schedule</b> system.

50|$|The Greeks {{were unable}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>schedule</b> for 1910. On {{the one hand}} {{problems}} in the Balkans made things difficult, but on the other, the modern Greeks found out the ancient Greeks were right: A two-year interval was too short. Where {{there had been a}} gap of six years before Athens 1906 (because of the almost all-American nature of the 1904 St Louis games), a gap of two years after London 1908 did not leave people enough time to prepare.|$|R
5000|$|Not all demonstrations were {{agitating}} {{in opposition}} to some issue. At the 2005 Scotland summit, {{for the first time}} the tens of thousands of people protesting outside were actually supporting the summit's agenda of African aid; and some activists travelled to Hokkaido for the same purpose. Veteran British actor and Oxfam activist Bill Nighy in Sapporo explained succinctly: [...] "We want to achieve exactly what we wanted to achieve last time Heiligendamm,, which is <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the G8 leaders and their governments to their promise. The promise that they would fulfil the Millennium Development Goals: primary school education for everyone; HIV medicines for all the people that are requiring it; maternal health; sustainable environment.

2500|$|Sprecher {{also found}} that the {{requirement}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> names and addresses of paraphernalia buyers created the same issue, since it might well have been considered probable cause sufficient for a search warrant. The village had likened it to similar records pharmacists were required <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> of <b>Schedule</b> V controlled substances. But he distinguished it by noting that the Schedule V drugs were themselves otherwise illegal to possess, whereas the paraphernalia was perfectly legal.
