Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.|$|E
5|$|According to Bulgarian National Revival enlightener Stefan Zahariev from Pazardzhik, St Demetrius was not {{the first}} church in this location. In <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pazardzhik {{district}} (kaza) published in 1870, he writes that a previously existing church in roughly the same place was dedicated to Saint Pantaleon and had given its name to the village of Patalenitsa. The Church of St Pantaleon was, according to Zahariev, previously an Ancient Greek sanctuary of Asclepius. He writes that a column from this church with an inscription dedicated to Asclepius was preserved in the newer village church.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about {{his time in}} Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. <b>His</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book {{until his death in}} 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward.|$|E

25|$|Elisabeth of Bohemia also {{corresponded with}} Descartes on the Meditations.

25|$|Written around 1080, one of {{the oldest}} written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian {{religious}} practices is Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum. Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the Latinized name Fricco and mentions that an image of him at Skara was destroyed by the Christian missionary, Bishop Egino. <b>His</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple at Uppsala gives some details on the god.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of Heraclea Minoa was first {{identified by the}} 16th century historian Tommaso Fazello. It was situated {{a few hundred yards}} to the southeast of the mouth of the river Platani (the ancient Halycus), atop the conspicuous promontory now called Capo Bianco, with gently sloping sides down to the Platani valley to the north, and sheer white cliffs to the ocean on the south side. This is evidently the one called by Strabo, in <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coasts of Sicily, the Heraclean promontory which he correctly gives as 20miles distant from the port of Agrigentum.|$|E

25|$|By {{the third}} century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, Ursa Minor, to navigate. In the mid-1st century AD Lucan writes of Pompey who {{questions}} a sailor {{about the use of}} stars in navigation. The sailor replies with <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of circumpolar stars to navigate by. To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a circumpolar star above that degree in the sky. For example, Apollonius would have used β Draconis to navigate as he traveled west {{from the mouth of the}} Alpheus River to Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|Socrates' {{idea that}} reality is {{unavailable}} {{to those who}} use their senses is what puts him {{at odds with the}} common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his Allegory of the Cave, and more explicitly in <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divided line. The Allegory of the Cave (begins Republic 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.|$|E
25|$|Daublebsky von Sterneck {{was named}} to succeed Friedrich von Pöck as Marinekommandant (Navy Commander) and Chef der Marinesektion (Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry) in November 1883 with the rank of Vizeadmiral. His efforts to {{modernize}} the Navy were hamstrung by interminable political friction between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. When Sir Edward J. Reed published {{the second half of}} his profile of the Continental navies in Harper's in February 1887, he dismissed the Austro-Hungarian Navy as antiquated and omitted any tabulation of information about the fleet's ships—in sharp contrast to <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet of Austria-Hungary's principal ally, Germany.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of these polemics, Brandes began to issue volumes {{of the most ambitious}} of his works, Main Currents in the Literature of the Nineteenth Century, of which four volumes {{appeared}} between 1872 and 1875 (English translation, 1901–1905). The brilliant novelty of this criticism of the literature of major European countries {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century, and <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general revolt against the pseudo-classicism of the 18th century, at once attracted attention outside Denmark. The tumult which gathered round the person of the critic increased the success of the work, and the reputation of Brandes grew apace, especially in Germany and Russia.|$|E
25|$|The {{style was}} given its name, many years later, by Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book, Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica, in <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jerónimos Monastery. Varnhagen named the style after King Manuel I, whose reign (1495–1521) coincided with its development. The style was much {{influenced}} by the astonishing successes of the voyages of discovery of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa {{to the discovery of}} Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East, drawing heavily on the style and decorations of East Indian temples.|$|E
25|$|Scelophysa trimeni is {{classified}} under the genus Scelophysa in the tribe Hopliini of the subfamily Rutelinae in the scarab beetle family Scarabaeidae.

He published <b>his</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species in the journal of the South African Philosophical Society (now the Royal Society of South Africa). Roland Trimen, another notable entomologist, was a contemporary of Péringuey, preceding him as director of the museum, and it is presumed that the specific epithet trimeni is in honour of Trimen. This may be confirmed by the text of Péringuey's paper, which is not accessible at present.|$|E
