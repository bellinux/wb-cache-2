40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{causes of}} small clutch sizes in tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions are poorly understood. Alexander Skutch proposed 50 {{years ago that}} higher nest predation in the south constrains {{the rate at which}} parent birds can deliver food to young and thereby constrains clutch size by limiting the number of young that parents can feed. This hypothesis for explaining differences in clutch size and parental behaviors between latitudes has remained untested. Here, a detailed study of bird species in Arizona and Argentina shows that Skutch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> explains clutch size variation within North and South America. However, neither Skutch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> nor two major alternatives explain differences between latitudes...|$|R

The study also tested Richard Easterlin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> cohort <b>hypothesis</b> utilizing forcible rape arrest-rate statistics from the U. S. Uniform Crime Reports. Easterlin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> suggests that crime rates will fluctate according to the relative size of age cohort. In short, large cohorts generate higher arrest rates than small cohorts. We tested this hypothesis as it is applied to forcible rape arrest rates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to examine the role of crosslinguistic {{influence}} in the acquisition of wh-questions by Korean-English bilingual children. Specifically, the goal is to test Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) syntax-pragmatics interface hypothesis, which advocates the existence of crosslinguistic influence and suggests that the syntax-pragmatics interface, or the C(omplementizer) -domain, is an area that is most vulnerable to influence. They predict that crosslinguistic influence is likely to occur if (a) the construction in question is relevant to the syntax-pragmatics interface, and (b) if there is surface overlap between the two features. The present study looks at the production of wh -questions by Korean-English bilingual children to test Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Since wh-questions in these languages involve the C-domain and show a surface overlap, the hypothesis predicts that Korean will influence English. In the bilinguals 2 ̆ 7 English, we should expect to see more wh-in-situ constructions than for monolingual English speakers. ^ Seven Korean-English bilingual children who reside in the U. S. Midwest were observed for the present study. Their ages ranged from 3; 4 to 5; 5 at the onset of the study, and the children were recorded every 2 - 4 weeks for approximately 11 months in spontaneous play interactions. Contrary to what Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts, the results show no wh-in-situ constructions from the bilingual children. All utterances containing wh-words, both in the main clause and in embedded clauses, have undergone movement. Hulk and Müller 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> fails to explain the data that we observe for these Korean-English bilingual children. Rather than applying wh-in-situ to English question formation, these children all satisfy the movement required in English. Possible explanations of results, as well as additional findings, will be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in individuals being treated for eating disorder at the residential level of care. The objective {{of this study was to}} inform collectively the multiple paradigms that have power in the treatment decisions for individual 2 ̆ 7 s seeking clinical care for an eating disorder, i. e. clinicians, payers, policy-makers, friends and family, and the afflicted person. Residential treatment is often overlooked or dismissed as a primary level of care, due to a lack of insurance and other third-party payment. The intension of this research study is to build support for a 360 -degree assessment including physical, behavioral, mental, emotional, and existential transformation with this population. Method: Data collection began in August 2011 and concluded August 2012. There were three unique test-times, (1) admission, (2) discharge, and (3) three-month post-discharge follow-up. The researcher analyzed the change in HRQOL between these three test times as well as correlational relationships between the change in HRQOL and change in depressive and eating disorder symptomatology, utilizing the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition and the Eating Disorder Inventory, third edition. Finally, the research investigated the relationship between duration of illness and HRQOL. Results: Preliminary data support the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypotheses</b> that residential treatment is an effective model for treating individuals with severe eating disorders as evidenced by HRQOL at discharge and three month follow-up. Furthermore, there were negative correlational relationships between the change in HRQOL and change in symptoms from admission to discharge, ultimately supporting the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that during the course of residential treatment subjects 2 ̆ 7 HRQOL improves and symptoms decrease. Contrary to the researcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> duration of illness did not have any relationship with the subjects 2 ̆ 7 change in quality of life from admission to discharge.

A 360 -degree approach is warranted in assessment and evaluation of treatment and discharge readiness. This study, though preliminary, provides significant data that can be used to inform multidisciplinary clinicians, policy-makers, third-party payers, and friends and family seeking counsel...|$|R

40|$|Milton Friedman {{proposed}} {{that there is}} a positive relationship between inflation and uncertainty about the future path of inflation. In contrast to previous studies of this hypothesis, we find strong statistical evidence that higher levels of inflation are less predictable, although innovations in inflation are somewhat better predictors of future volatility than the actual level of inflation. We argue that previous failures to find an inflation-uncertainty relationship are due to two factors. First, none of the previous work directly tested Friedman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> by including the level of inflation in the model of the conditional variance. Second, these studies also used symmetric models, which appears inconsistent with Friedman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Our results are robust to different sample periods and to assumptions about the presence of a unit root in inflation. To test the inflation-uncertainty hypothesis, we use state-dependent models (SDM 2 ̆ 7 s) of conditional moments to estimate the time-varying conditional variance of inflation. SDM 2 ̆ 7 s have three distinct advantages for this application: (1) They include the inflation rate in the model of the conditional variance, (2) they allow for asymmetric relationships, and (3) they nest several alternative, but symmetric, models such as ARCH, GARCH, and Rx models of conditional heteroscedasticity. For completeness, we compare our estimates of conditional variance to estimates using EGARCH models, an alternative to SDM models that also allows for asymmetric relationships but that does not nest ARCH, GARCH, and Rx models...|$|R

One {{of the most prominent}} theories in both academic and policy circles is Samuel Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s argument that professional militaries do not become involved in politics. We engage this premise in the Thai context. Utilizing data from a new and unique survey of 569 Thai military officers as well as results from focus groups and interviews with military officers, we evaluate the attitudes of Thai servicemen and develop a test of Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> We demonstrate that increasing levels of professionalism are generally poor predictors {{as to whether or not}} a Thai military officer prefers an apolitical military.

First, the survey allows us to operationalize and measure professionalism at the individual level. Second, using these measures we are able to empirically test Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that more professional soldiers should prefer to remain apolitical. Finally, we provide an uncommon glimpse at the opinions of Thai military officers regarding military interventions, adding to the relatively sparse body of literature on factors internal to the Thai military which push officers toward politics...|$|R
