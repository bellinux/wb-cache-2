5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which <b>depresses</b> the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} was to compare Forgiveness in normal, non-{{clinical}} <b>depressed</b> and clinical <b>depressed</b> people. 151 individuals including 31 clinical <b>depressed,</b> 60 non-clinical <b>depressed</b> and 60 normal people were asked to complete Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI; Enright et al., 1991) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, 1979). Result revealed that normal group have been more forgiving than non-clinical <b>depressed</b> group. There was no significant difference between non- clinical <b>depressed</b> and clinical <b>depressed</b> group in forgiveness.

5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter <b>depresses</b> him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was the {{comparison}} of personal behavior styles in clinical <b>depressed,</b> non-clinical <b>depressed</b> and normal people. 151 persons including 31 clinical <b>depressed,</b> 60 non-clinical <b>depressed</b> persons and 60 normal persons were asked to complete questionnaires assessing Personal Behavior Style (PBI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Result revealed that Non-clinical <b>depressed</b> group has used inner control more than clinical <b>depressed</b> group but used other control style less than them. Normal group has used inner control style of behavior more than non-clinical <b>depressed</b> group but they have used other control style less than them. In response to study questions, results showed non-clinical <b>depressed</b> people had more lack of constraints and predictability in compare with clinical <b>depressed</b> people. Inner control style which has a positive relation with depression is a powerful predictor for depression. People who have Inner control style of behavior believe that their efforts are effective and they try to reach their goals. This kind of attitude protects them against depression...|$|R
40|$|The term <b>depressed</b> classes used in {{official}} records between 1920 and 1935 by the British, denotes the people those who socially, economically and politically oppressed by the dominated castes. These <b>depressed</b> classes realized their degradable position {{due to the}} introduction of English education which allowed all people in schools irrespective of their castes. In addition their organisations and leaders kindled them to fight for their rights. In the first half of 20 th century it shaped into a movement called <b>depressed</b> class movement. The liberating sense of <b>depressed</b> classes infuriated the dominated castes especially Brahmins and non-brahmin caste-Hindus. Though Brahmins opposed the movement of <b>depressed</b> classes they did not attack them directly. They used non-brahmin caste-Hindus as a weapon to attack <b>depressed</b> classes. Consequently heavy violent outburst started throughout Tamilnadu. Strict rules imposed on <b>depressed</b> classes and compelled to obey that order.

40|$|The {{activity}} of frog isolated hearts was <b>depressed</b> by altering the perfusing Ringer solution in five different ways: {{by reducing the}} calcium content, by increasing the potassium content, and by adding ether, thiopentone or acetylcholine. <b>Depressed</b> hearts were perfused with Ringer solution containing the following stimulant drugs: paullinia tannin, tannic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium oleate, sodium caprylate and ouabain. All these stimulant drugs had similar actions on hearts <b>depressed</b> by calcium lack, ether and thiopentone; hearts <b>depressed</b> by acetylcholine were, however, only weakly stimulated. Hearts <b>depressed</b> by potassium were readily stimulated by oleate, caprylate and paullinia tannin; ouabain and hydrogen peroxide had weak stimulant actions on hearts <b>depressed</b> by potassium, and tannic acid had a negative inotropic action. The differing actions on hearts <b>depressed</b> by potassium are probably related to differences in the degrees of fixation of the stimulant drugs.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of infant rearing {{on the behavior of}} <b>depressed</b> adult female Macaca fascicularis and {{the influence of}} <b>depressed</b> infant-rearing adult female Macaca fascicularis on their infants in a free enclosure environment. Methods: Here, 20 <b>depressed</b> subjects and then 20 healthy subjects were randomly selected from a total population of 1007 adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects. Four <b>depressed</b> subjects and eight healthy subjects were rearing infants. By focal observation, three trained observers video-recorded the selected subjects over a total observational period of 560 hours. The video footage was analyzed by qualified blinded analysts that coded the raw footage into quantitative behavioral data (i. e., durations of 53 pre-defined behavioral items across 12 behavioral categories) for statistical analysis. Results: Between infant-rearing and non-rearing healthy subjects, ten differential behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing and non-rearing <b>depressed</b> subjects, nine behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing healthy and infant-rearing <b>depressed</b> subjects, fifteen behaviors distributed across six behavioral categories were identified. Conclusion: Infant-rearing <b>depressed</b> adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects may have a worse psychological status as compared to non-rearing <b>depressed</b> counterparts. Infant rearing may negatively influence <b>depressed</b> Macaca fascicularis mothers. Infant-rearing <b>depressed</b> subjects were less adequate at raising infants as compared to infant-rearing health...|$|R

25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it <b>depresses</b> excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the boiling}} point for aqueous {{ethylene}} glycol increases monotonically with increasing ethylene-glycol fraction. Thus, the use of ethylene glycol not only <b>depresses</b> the freezing point, but also elevates {{the boiling point}} such that the operating range for the heat-transfer fluid is broadened {{on both ends of}} the temperature scale. The increase in boiling temperature is due to pure ethylene glycol having a much higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure than pure water; there is no chemical stabilization against boiling of the liquid phase at intermediate compositions, as there is against freezing.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} active {{metabolites}} of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, which, contrary to buprenorphine itself, is a full agonist of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly <b>depresses</b> respiration (10-fold more than buprenorphine). This {{can be explained by}} very poor brain penetration of norbuprenorphine due to a high affinity of the compound for P-glycoprotein. In contrast to norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine and its glucuronide metabolites are negligibly transported by P-glycoprotein.|$|E
40|$|Adolescent <b>depressed</b> mood {{is related}} to the {{development}} of subsequent mental health problems, and family problems have been linked to adolescent depression. Longitudinal research on adolescent <b>depressed</b> mood is needed to establish the unique impact of family problems independent of other potential drivers. This study tested the extent to which family conflict exacerbates <b>depressed</b> mood during adolescence, independent of changes in <b>depressed</b> mood over time, academic performance, bullying victimization, negative cognitive style, and gender. Students (13  years old) participated in a three-wave bi-national study (n =  961 from the State of Washington, United States, n =  981 from Victoria, Australia; 98  % retention, 51  % female in each sample). The model was cross-lagged and controlled for the autocorrelation of <b>depressed</b> mood, negative cognitive style, academic failure, and bullying victimization. Family conflict partially predicted changes in <b>depressed</b> mood independent of changes in <b>depressed</b> mood over time and the other controls. There was also evidence that family conflict and adolescent <b>depressed</b> mood are reciprocally related over time. The findings were closely replicated across the two samples. The study identifies potential points of intervention to interrupt the progression of <b>depressed</b> mood in early to middle adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Depression is a {{significant}} problem among adolescents, especially females. The current study investigated interaction patterns along the dimensions of autonomy and relatedness in families of <b>depressed</b> adolescents. Externalizing adolescents and nonclinic adolescents were included as controls. Family interaction was assessed by observational coding of a mother-adolescents problem-solving task, {{as well as by}} mother and adolescent reports of family functioning. Adolescent self-concept was also assessed as a potential mediator in the link between family interaction and adolescent depression. Results suggest that <b>depressed</b> adolescents perceive the quality of their relationships with their parents to be significantly impaired. Mothers of <b>depressed</b> adolescents reported heightened conflict with their <b>depressed</b> adolescents, but not in the general home environment. Observation of <b>depressed</b> adolescents and their mothers during the problem-solving task revealed that although mothers showed normal levels of warmth and involvement, they tended to ignore or cut-off statements made by their adolescents. Several interesting gender differences emerged within the <b>depressed</b> group. During the observation task, <b>depressed</b> girls and their mothers showed higher levels of autonomy and a more positive connection relative to <b>depressed</b> boys and their mothers. Similarly, homes of <b>depressed</b> boys were perceived by mothers as especially low in cohesion and expressiveness and as high in control. It appeared that <b>depressed</b> girls seemed caught between wanting their autonomy and their desire for positive relatedness. <b>Depressed</b> boys appeared to be more resigned and passive in the face of high levels of control in the home. Finally, self-concept was significantly impaired in the <b>depressed</b> adolescents although it did not mediate the relationship between family interaction and adolescent depression...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} differences between <b>depressed</b> and non- <b>depressed</b> adolescents (12 to 20 years), in decoding emotion intensity and perceived rejection and acceptance in both non- basic facial expressions and postures. The {{effect of the}} gender of the poser as well as the gender and the age of the participant were also of interest. Confirming earlier studies, girls decoded more anger than boys in non-basic facial expressions, but this gender difference was only found in the nondepressed group. <b>Depressed</b> boys decoded anger with the same high intensity as girls, and within girls no effect of depression was found. Contrary to expectations, female and male facial expressions were not decoded with different emotional intensity in general. Nevertheless, in decoding signs of rejection in the same facial expressions, the non-depressed group tended to decode more rejection in female faces, whereas the <b>depressed</b> group did not distinguish between male and female faces. An unexpected finding was that <b>depressed</b> adolescents also decoded more happiness in non-basic facial expressions than non- <b>depressed</b> adolescents. Also, and particularly in <b>depressed</b> boys, they decoded more acceptance in positive postural displays. In conclusion, <b>depressed</b> adolescents decode both more negative and more positive emotional and interpersonal meaning in subtle nonverbal cues, and these effects appear stronger for <b>depressed</b> boys than <b>depressed</b> girls. Implications of these findings will be discussed...|$|R
