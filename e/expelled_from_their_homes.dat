The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were <b>expelled</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living.

Since that time, the Palestinians have demanded full implementation of the right of return, meaning that each refugee would be granted the option of returning to his or her home, with property restored, and receive compensation. Israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to Israel proper, rather than to the newly created Palestinian state, would mean an influx of Palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of Israel, jeopardizing Israel's Jewish character and its existence as a whole.|$|E

25|$|In October 1641, after a bad {{harvest and}} in a {{threatening}} political climate, Phelim O'Neill launched a rebellion, hoping to rectify various grievances of Irish Catholic landowners. However, once the rebellion was underway, the resentment of the native Irish in Ulster boiled over into indiscriminate attacks on the settler population in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Irish Catholics attacked the plantations all around the country, but especially in Ulster. English writers at the time put the Protestant victims at over 100,000. William Petty, in his survey of the 1650s, estimated the death toll at around 30,000. More recent research, however, based on close examination of the depositions of the Protestant refugees collected in 1642, suggests a figure of 4,000 settlers were killed directly; and up to 12,000 may have died of causes also related to disease (always a cause of high fatalities during wartime) or privation after being <b>expelled</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{began in}} Belfast in July 1920. On 21 July 1920, rioting {{broke out in}} the city, starting in the shipyards and later spreading to residential areas. The violence was partly in response to the IRA killing of a northern RIC police officer Gerald Smyth, in Cork, and partly because of competition over jobs due to the high unemployment rate. loyalists marched on the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast and forced over 7,000 Catholic and left-wing Protestant workers from their jobs. Sectarian rioting broke out in response in Belfast resulting in about 20 deaths in just three days. Both Catholics and Protestants were also <b>expelled</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> in the trouble. The IRA assassination of an RIC Detective, Swanzy, in nearby Lisburn on 22 August prompted another round of clashes, in which 33 people died in the city over the following 10 days. The violence led to the reviving of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a unionist militia first formed in 1912. Thereafter there were recurring cycles of violence until the summer of 1922.|$|E
40|$|The narrators of Roughing It in the Bush and Obasan {{struggle}} {{with the notion of}} home and how to reinvent it in situations of exile.

Naomi reinvents home by questioning official, exclusionary discourse and testifying to the Japanese Canadian history of internment and dispersal. Both narrators negotiate borders between private experience and public discourse and in the process, explore the question: "What is the meaning of home?...|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of the inner German border {{took place in a}} number of stages between 1945 and the mid-1980s. After its establishment in 1945 as the dividing line between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of Germany, in 1949 the inner German border became the frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany). The border remained relatively easy to cross until it was abruptly closed by the GDR in 1952 in response to the large-scale emigration of East Germans to the West. Barbed-wire fences and minefields were installed and draconian restrictions were placed on East German citizens living near the border. Thousands were <b>expelled</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> with several thousand more fleeing to the West. From the late 1960s, the border fortifications were greatly strengthened through the installation of new fences, detectors, watchtowers and booby-traps designed to prevent attempts to escape from East Germany. The improved border defences succeeded in reducing the scale of unauthorised emigration to a trickle.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In extreme {{life events}} basic {{assumptions}} are frequently reassessed and changed. Therefore, trauma requires re-education. Effective coping strategies enable individual to tolerate, minimize, accept or ignore what one cannot manage and to moder­ate {{the consequences of}} stressful, traumatic events. Materials and Methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate coping strategies in refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder prior and after group cognitive-behavioural therapy. The sample included 70 refu­gees who experienced multiple stressors such as organized violence, ethnic conflicts, bombing, <b>expelling</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and life in exile. Impact Event Scales-Revised, Ways of Coping-Revised, Scale of Cognitive Self-regulation and Scale of Coping Strategies were administered before and after six months of group cognitive-behavioural therapy. Results. Post-traumatic stress disorder in refugees after therapy significantly decreased. Cognitive self-regulation was improved by moving locus of control from external to internal resources. Coping was qualitatively different, with a wider repertoire of adaptive strategies. Discussion. Cognitive group work facilitates processes of grieving, working-through of traumatic material, increasing emotional awareness and developing creativity in coping. Conclusion. Our findings highlight the positive impact of cognitive-behavioural treatment on post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic adjustment. ...|$|R
