50|$|Where {{hide glue}} is in {{occasional}} use, <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> may {{be held in}} a freezer, to prevent spoilage from the growth of microorganisms. Hide glue has some gap filling properties, although modern gap-filling adhesives such as epoxy resin are better in this regard.|$|E
50|$|The veneer {{is pushed}} into the glue with the wide blade, and the hammer is pushed or pulled, forcing out the excess hide glue. The sheer bulk of the metal head helps to cool the glue, causing it to grab and hold the veneer in place. The glue cures as it cools. The {{procedure}} is to work from the center, out towards the edges, forcing the hot <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> {{out from under the}} veneer.|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperienced peeling {{operators}} {{are able to}} adjust the settings of their device by hearing the sound coming from the process. Based on this idea, a research program was undertaken to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} acoustic or vibration measurements supplying a support decision system to assist untrained operators. The present paper deals with lathe check phenomenon {{which is one of the}} most critical defects of veneer (leading to handling difficulties, <b>excess</b> of <b>glue</b> consumption, poor veneer surface quality, etc.). Several signal processing techniques giving a spectral representation of sensors measurements are compared. Finally, an original procedure based on Power Spectral Density ratio is proposed to measure the average lathe check frequency of the veneer during the process...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} online lathe checks measurement. It {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} defects of veneer (leading to handling difficulties, <b>excess</b> of <b>glue</b> consumption, poor veneer surface quality, etc.). It could be characterized by lathe checks depth or frequency but these indicators require tedious measurements of the veneers. The objective of this work is to get an estimation of veneer lathe check indicators from vibratory and acoustical measurements. This approach is inspired by operators who are able to adapt the lathe settings “at the noise”. Acoustic and vibratory measurements during the peeling process were performed. Several signal processing techniques giving a spectral representation of sensors measurements are compared. Finally, an analysis of spectrum is proposed to measure the average lathe check frequency of the veneer during the process. Xylomat Scientific Network funded by ANR- 10 -EQPX- 16 XYLOFOREST.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} four field-of-view (FOV) metrics that, {{when applied to}} a low-resolution image of a {{microscope}} slide, are capable of both accurately delineating the specimen and selecting a subset of focus candidate FOVs required for construction of high-resolution focus map. The metrics evaluated are: threshold index (TI) that measures image intensity; normalised auto-correlation index (NACI) that measures spatial image similarity; auto-phase correlation index (APCI) that measures image phase diversity; and entropy index (EI) that measures the predictability of image intensities. Experiments are undertaken on a data set of forty slides including PAP stained Thin-prep cervical cytology and breast fine-needle aspiration slides and haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained histology slides. These slides were scanned on an automated bright-field microscope and chosen to be indicative of a variety pathology specimens, containing artefacts such as <b>excess</b> coverslip <b>glue</b> and ink markers. Results are presented {{on the performance of}} each metric for correct ranking/segmentation of foreground (specimen) from background, and subsequently selecting focus candidate FOVs characteristic of the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s focal plane(s). The experimental results demonstrate that while NACI, APCI and EI are all effective at specimen delineation, only APCI is capable of effectively selecting superior focus candidates and ignoring artefacts...|$|R
5000|$|Planning {{for wood}} {{finishing}} also involves {{being aware of}} how the finishing process influences the end result. Careful handling of the wood is needed to avoid dents, scratches and soiling with dirt. Wood should be marked for cutting using pencil rather than ink; however, avoid hard or soft pencil. HB is recommend for face work and 2H for joint work. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid squeeze-out of glue from joints because the glue will reduce absorption of stain and finish. Any <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> should be carefully removed to avoid further damage to the wood.|$|E
50|$|The LMC {{works from}} underneath, using {{high-speed}} techniques to machine each layer in turn. As each layer is roughed and finished a new plate is bonded, {{ready for the}} next machining operation, this continues until the finished part is built up. WorkNC-LMP automates this process starting from the CAD model, firstly splitting it into layers, and then generating both the roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer. This technique is ideal for high speed machining enabling the use of short and rigid cutters, and eliminates the possibility of a collision. WorkNC-LMP allows to select the material from a materials library and controls factors such as surface roughening prior to bonding, cutting adhesive channels to control <b>excess</b> <b>glue,</b> overlapping of cutter paths to remove traces of glue, and paths for the application of adhesive between layers. It provides the visual control of all toolpaths and the calculation of the estimated total machining time.|$|E
5000|$|When dowels are glued into blind holes, a {{very common}} case in dowel-based joinery, {{there must be a}} path for air and <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> to escape when the dowel is pressed into place. If no {{provision}} is made to relieve the hydraulic pressure of air and glue, hammering the dowel home or clamping the joint can split the wood. An old solution to this problem is to plane a flat {{on the side of the}} dowel; some sources suggest planing the flat on the rough stock before the final shaping of the round dowel. [...] Some dowel plates solve the problem by cutting a groove in the side of the dowel as it is forced through; this is done by a groove screw, a pointed screw intruding from the side into the dowel cutting opening. Some dowel pins are [...] with multiple parallel grooves along their length to serve the same purpose.|$|E
40|$|The {{repair of}} fetal bodies after {{dissection}} {{is extremely difficult}} because of the delicacy of the skin. A tissue adhesive, Histoacryl blue, was used to repair bodies that had been dissected either before or after immersion in formalin. The repairs were achieved rapidly and neatly. The technique was easy to learn and, providing the method of repair described was followed, there was no breakdown subsequently. The body cavities and reflected skin surfaces were lightly dried with absorbent paper towels and the body loosely packed with cotton wool. "Holding lines" of glue were made and a mid-line strip of glue {{was applied to the}} sternum, abdomen, and skull vault, allowing the skin edges to align neatly. Care must be taken to avoid using <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> as this produces an exothermic reaction. It is recommended that if a fetus has to be repaired after dissection Histoacryl blue will give a good result...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) uses {{commercial}} waveguide {{windows on}} the output waveguide of Ka-band (32 GHz) low-noise amplifiers. Mechanical failure of these windows resulted in an unacceptable loss in tracking time. To address this issue, a new Ka-band WR- 28 waveguide window has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The window uses a slab of low-loss, low-dielectric constant foam that is bonded into a 1 / 2 -wave-thick waveguide/flange. The foam is a commercially available, rigid, closed-cell polymethacrylimide. It has excellent electrical properties with a dielectric constant of 1. 04, and a loss tangent of 0. 01. It is relatively strong with a tensile strength of 1 MPa. The material is virtually impermeable to helium. The finished window exhibits a leak rate of less than 3 x 10 (exp - 3) cu cm/s with helium. The material is also chemically resistant and can be cleaned with acetone. The window is constructed by fabricating a window body by brazing a short length of WR- 28 copper waveguide into a standard rectangular flange, and machining the resulting part to a thickness of 4. 6 mm. The foam is machined to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 7. 06 x 3. 53 mm. The foam is bonded into the body with a two-part epoxy. After curing, the <b>excess</b> <b>glue</b> and foam are knife-trimmed by hand. The finished window has a loss of less than 0. 08 dB (2 %) and a return loss of greater than 25 dB at 32 GHz. This meets the requirements for the DSN application. The window is usable for most applications over the entire 26 -to- 40 -GHz waveguide band. The window return loss can be tuned to a required frequency by var y in g {{the thickness of the}} window slightly. Most standard waveguide windows use a thin membrane of material bonded into a recess in a waveguide flange, or sandwiched between two flanges with a polymer seal. Designs using the recessed window are prone to mechanical failure over time due to constraints on the dimensions of the recess that allow the bond to fail. Designs using the sandwich method are often permeable to helium, which prohibits the use of helium leak detection. At the time of this reporting, 40 windows have been produced. Twelve are in operation with a combined operating time of over 30, 000 hours without a failure...|$|E
