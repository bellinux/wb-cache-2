Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance. Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, [...] "there is a thin line between Jason and the pimp...both characters are struggling with power and how they use it." [...] Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it [...] "is not just somebody else's problem over there...but that it's us, and it's in our country and <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>backyard</b> and in our suburbs". Jason has in this way been considered an everyman.

500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I was my mother and [...] was me. We were playing <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>backyard</b> again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

[...] He later added {{in an article in}} The Guardian that:Observers compared it to the toppling of Russian domains in 1989, but there are important differences. Crucially, no Mikhail Gorbachev exists among the great powers that support the Arab dictators. Rather, Washington and its allies keep to the well-established principle that democracy is acceptable only insofar as it conforms to strategic and economic objectives: fine in enemy territory (up to a point), but not <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>backyard,</b> please, unless properly tamed. One 1989 comparison has some validity: Romania, where Washington maintained its support for Nicolae Ceaușescu, the most vicious of the east European dictators, until the allegiance became untenable. Then Washington hailed his overthrow while the past was erased. That is a standard pattern: Ferdinand Marcos, Jean-Claude Duvalier, Chun Doo-hwan, Suharto and many other useful gangsters. It may be under way in the case of Hosni Mubarak, along with routine efforts to try to ensure a successor regime will not veer far from the approved path.|$|E
