5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, the Glazers were {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> Credit Suisse {{in preparation for a}} $1billion (approx. £600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1554, Wyatt's {{rebellion}} broke out; it {{was soon}} suppressed. Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence. Though {{it is unlikely that}} she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador Simon Renard, argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, worked to have Elizabeth put on trial. Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including Lord Paget, convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to Woodstock, where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfield. Crowds cheered her all along the way.|$|E

5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E
25|$|Voyager 1 was {{launched}} in 1977, passed the orbit of Pluto in 1990, and left the solar system (in the sense of passing the termination shock) in November 2004.

In about 40,000 years, it and Voyager 2 will each come to within about 1.8 light-years of two separate stars: Voyager 1 will <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> star Gliese 445, located in the constellation Camelopardalis; and Voyager 2 will <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> star Ross 248, located in the constellation of Andromeda.|$|E

With Major League Baseball {{moving from the}} four-man pitching rotation of McLain's era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on relief pitchers, some observers believe that another 30-game winner may not occur {{because of the way}} the game is played today.|$|E

25|$|On October 13, 1971, the World Series held a {{night game}} {{for the very first}} time.

25|$|Williams {{likely would}} <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> or {{exceeded}} Babe Ruth's home run record {{if he had}} not served in the military, and might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.|$|E
25|$|Carl Sagan in {{his book}} Comet (1985) reproduces Han period Chinese {{manuscript}} (the Book of Silk, 2nd century BC) that shows comet tail varieties: most are variations on simple comet tails, but the last shows the comet nucleus with four bent arms extending from it, recalling a swastika. Sagan suggests that in antiquity a comet could <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> so close to Earth that the jets of gas streaming from it, bent by the comet's rotation, became visible, leading {{to the adoption of}} the swastika as a symbol across the world.|$|E

H. Harriman attempted to meet with Cassidy through his old ally Matt Warner. On August 29, 1900, Cassidy, Longabaugh and others robbed Union Pacific train No. 3 near Tipton, Wyoming, violating Cassidy's earlier promise to the Governor of Wyoming and ending any chance for amnesty.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{gradually}} increasing, the female literacy rate in India {{is less than}} the male literacy rate. Far fewer girls than boys are enrolled in school, and many girls drop out.

According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of Kerala and Mizoram <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements in the social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the American Chemical Society {{have further}} {{suggested}} that aquaponics, {{would be an}} ideal socially-acceptable solution in the post-contamination environment as it does not use soil to grow fish and vegetables, thus completely alleviating the radiophobia surrounding food that always follows long-lived contamination incidents. While others who <b>have</b> <b>approached</b> the problem from a far more extreme view, assuming far worse events such as comet impacts, have suggested, fossil gas-digesting bacteria larger scale mushroom cultivation as {{they do not need}} sunlight or soil to grow, along with the expansion of less popular food production methods, such as Leaf protein concentrate, as detailed in the 2014 book Feeding Everyone No Matter What.|$|E
