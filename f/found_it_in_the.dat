5|$|Between being {{commissioned}} in 1896 and {{the outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Massachusetts conducted training exercises off the eastern coast of the United States. During the war, she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Schley went searching for Cervera's Spanish squadron and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> port of Santiago. The battleship was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, because she had steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, the battleship came back to Santiago, where she and Texas fired at the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} A.abrupta grow on the ground, {{typically}} solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn. The {{frequency with which}} fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom {{has been described as}} common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A.abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south as Mexico. Orson K. Miller claims to have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A.abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long time}} the most {{detailed}} study of Odysseus's travels {{was that of the}} French Homeric scholar Victor Bérard. Although adopting the general frame of reference of the ancient commentators, Bérard differed from them in some details. For Bérard the land of the Lotus-Eaters was Djerba off southern Tunisia; the land of the Cyclopes was at Posillipo in Italy; the island of Aeolus was Stromboli; the Laestrygonians were in northern Sardinia; Circe's home was Monte Circeo in Lazio; the entrance to the Underworld was near Cumae, just where Aeneas <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Aeneid; the Sirens were on the coast of Lucania; Scylla and Charybdis were at the Strait of Messina; the Island of the Sun was Sicily; the homeland of Calypso was at the Straits of Gibraltar. From there Odysseus's route took him to Scherie, which Bérard, like so many of his ancient predecessors, identified with Corcyra.|$|E

500|$|Allward had {{initially}} hoped to use white marble for the memorial's facing stone, but Percy Nobbs suggested {{this would be}} a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a [...] "ghost like" [...] appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ruins of Diocletian's Palace at Split, Croatia; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone's durability. His choice—Seget limestone—came from an ancient Roman quarry located near Seget, Croatia. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, delayed delivery of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.|$|E

500|$|The Parthian Empire ( [...] ; 247BC – 224AD), {{also known}} as the Arsacid Empire (...) , was a major Iranian {{political}} and cultural power in ancient Iran and Iraq.

She <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fantasy film [...] (2016), co-starring Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt. The film served as both a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman. She {{was drawn to the}} idea of playing a female warrior whose abilities were on par with those of the lead male character, but the film generated negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Also that year, Chastain launched a production company named Freckle Films, headed by a team of female executives. She then starred as the title character, a lobbyist, in the gun control thriller Miss Sloane, which reunited her with John Madden. Chastain read the novel Capitol Punishment by Jack Abramoff to research the practice of lobbying in America, and met with female lobbyists to study their mannerisms and sense of style. Hailing her {{as one of the best}} actresses on the planet, Peter Travers commended Chastain for successfully drawing the audience into Sloane's life.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind {{proved to be a}} modest financial success and received acclaim, with several critics terming it {{as one of the best}} films of the 21st century. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone considered it to be a [...] "uniquely funny, unpredictably tender and unapologetically twisted romance" [...] and thought that Winslet was [...] "electrifying and bruisingly vulnerable" [...] in it. A journalist for Premire magazine wrote that she had favourably abandoned [...] "her corseted English rose persona in favor of a drunken, motormouthed bohemian" [...] and listed it as the 81st greatest film performance of all time. Winslet considers it to be a favourite among her roles, and she received Best Actress nominations at the Oscar and BAFTA award ceremonies.
