5000|$|A 2009 {{article in}} Artforum about Murata's art noted that [...] "the {{artificial}} palette, flashing lights, abstract patterns, and coarsely pixelated texture of Pink Dot and other works by Murata locate {{him in the}} tradition of <b>electronic</b> <b>animation</b> pioneered by John Whitney and Lillian Schwartz. But while his predecessors were testing the computer's ability to replicate the cinematic illusion of movement, Murata uses the tools of consumer-level film-editing software to undo that illusion, with trails of pixel dust tracking the changing positions of the image from frame to frame.".|$|E

5000|$|Tockar {{was born}} in Kelowna, British Columbia on February 11, 1969. At the age of five, Tockar told his mother {{that he wanted to}} [...] "grow up to be a cartoon". Tockar did not {{initially}} understand the concept of a cartoon when he made the statement. At the age of ten, Tockar won first place in a talent show for his vocal impersonations of Kermit the Frog and Bugs Bunny. At the age of 12, Tockar won his first public speaking award for reading a two-thousand word essay on horror films. During his teenage years, before graduating from Kelowna Secondary School, Lee opened a graphic arts business which enabled him to travel around British Columbia and paint wall murals for restaurants. In 1988, he won the British Columbia Playwright competition for his original work, [...] "Confessions", which was performed at the Waterfront Theatre on Granville Island in Vancouver, British Columbia. A year later in 1989, he was runner-up for his second play, [...] "You Obviously Werenâ€™t Listening". In 2008, Tockar was presented with the 2008 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Animation</b> Award for [...] "Best Male Voice-over Artist of the Year" [...] for his portrayal of George in George of the Jungle; the award was handed to him by Family Guy creator and actor Seth MacFarlane.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the level of learning {{and the rate of}} success of students the educational policy tries {{to find a way to}} increase simultaneously the skills and the knowledge of students especially in higher education. Many approaches have aimed to find the solutions. To reach this goal normally the combination of the various sciences can be more effective than one branch. Then we interested to know how the other science can help us to be close to this goal. The artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of science that has a very wide domain of using. It can help us in various sciences like <b>electronic,</b> <b>animation,</b> medicine, banking, industries, exploitation, robotic, security and even speaking. We decided to show the relation between AI and the sciences of education as an important branch of the human science. Thus we aimed to demonstrate in this article an approach for helping the student at university by means of finding solution for their problems of learning. In attempt this goal we used other sciences to help us. The artificial intelligence is a science that can be of help in this project. We suggest that the students have the basic knowledge but they don't know how they must use them correctly. Thus they need to some skills. So this study tries to demonstrate these skills and a way to acquire it by means of making conjunction between science of education and the science of artificial intelligence...|$|E

40|$|Modeling and {{creation}} of realistic human heads have applications in various domains, including computer <b>animation,</b> <b>electronic</b> games, virtual environment, film production, etc. Often the characters designed by artists are far from being human-like. In crowd simulation, characters tend {{to have the same}} or similar face appearances. In 3 D games, it is important for users to have plenty of selections of 3 D avatars. We explore an approach, which makes use of 3 D scans of real persons to reconstruct countless new faces. The reconstructed faces based on principal components analysis have differences in ethnicity, gender, face shape, height and weight. ...|$|R
40|$|Realistic modeling, simulation, and {{rendering}} of fluid media have applications in various domains, including special effects, computer <b>animation,</b> <b>electronic</b> games, engineering visualization, medical simulation, etc. Often the computational expense involved in simulating complex fluid phenomena limits the spatio-temporal resolution at which these simulations can be performed. This limitation makes {{it extremely difficult}} to synthesize complex fine-resolution microstructures on the free surface of the fluid, e. g., patterns in lava flow, small-scale waves in a river stream, leaves and flowers in the creek, etc. Even with highly robust and sophisticated simulation systems, capable of modeling such details, it is non-trivial to control the shape and appearance of these patterns within the simulation. We explore an alternative approach which makes use of samples of fluid shape and surface appearance to aid and complement fluid simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|We numerically and {{experimentally}} demonstrated highly directional emission from photonic crystals (PCs). Our structures comprise branched waveguide channels with {{a periodic}} doubling scheme. An incident electromagnetic wave can be first split into multiple beams using PC waveguide structures. The beams were then emitted at the output waveguide ports of the PC {{with the same}} phase, {{which resulted in a}} highly directional radiation pattern. Our results demonstrate that the full width at half maximum of the emission beam is nearly inversely proportional to the number of output waveguide ports. Typically, for a PC with sixteen output ports, the half-power beam width measured 4. 8 â—¦, which was in good agreement with the calculated value of 4. 1 â—¦. In contrast to the traditional beaming structures, our design did not involve grating-like structures, which resulted in a wider operation bandwidth.

40|$|Digital {{instructional}} tools develop rapidly, {{and they}} can create novel learning experiences. Still, adoption of new formats is often expensive, and their efficacy is untested. Whiteboard animations are an increasingly popular form of educational media. Although recent research {{in the development of}} whiteboard animations is rich, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of learner experiences with this type of animation. The purpose of this study is to provide concrete scientific evidence for the impact on retention and subjective experiences of enjoyment, engagement, and challenge. We recruited participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N = 621; 239 females). We used a between-subjects design with participants assigned randomly to one of four instructional conditions: whiteboard <b>animation,</b> <b>electronic</b> slideshow (i. e., sequential images with narration), audio (i. e., narration) only, and text only. For learning experiences, we also introduce a novel behavioral measure of engagement alongside participant self-reports by eliciting continuation values with diminishing compensation. Using repeated measure ANOVAs to test effect of lesson format on subjective experiences and one-way ANOVAs to test the effect of lesson format on retention, we found that whiteboard animations have a positive effect on retention, engagement and enjoyment, although we do not rule out the possibility that some of this result is due to novelty...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{integration}} of Information Technology in the Building Design Engineering Studio. It {{is based on the}} work carried out by the CADET Unit (CAD Education and Training), which promotes {{a better understanding of the}} built environment through an integrated approach to design studio teaching. This is achieved through a dynamic studio environment guided by a Building Design Engineering ethos that adopts a holistic approach to design, recognising that design in engineering, architecture and the visual arts demands an understanding of the challenges of a multidisciplinary approach that acknowledges a broader cultural dimension. There are increasing demands placed on students of architecture and engineering. They require skills in making physical as well as computer models, they must be able to draw in 18 th & 19 th century conventional media (paper, pen and pencil) as well as CAD and they must be proficient in rendering in full colour both conventionally and in the <b>electronic</b> media including <b>animations.</b> The creative use of the computer at the point of analysis and conceptualisation, as important as technical proficiency, is a necessary part of the design process. In recognition of the demands that we currently make of university students we are exploring two critical responses. In the first case we demonstrate an integrated approach to design studio practice, achieving a value added learning experience in the University Sector, and with a view to the longer term we are exploring the application of a similar design approach within the Secondary School Sector in order to raise the awareness of design at an earlier stage...|$|R
40|$|Pictures {{show that}} {{streamer}} or sprite discharge channels {{emerging from the}} same electrode sometimes seem to reconnect or merge though their heads carry electric charge of the same polarity; one might therefore suspect that reconnections are an artefact of the two-dimensional projection in the pictures. Here we use stereo photography to investigate the full three-dimensional structure of such events. We analyse reconnection, possibly an electrostatic effect in which a late thin streamer reconnects to an earlier thick streamer channel, and merging, a suggested photoionization effect in which two simultaneously propagating streamer heads merge into one new streamer. We use four different anode geometries (one tip, two tips, two asymmetric protrusions in a plate and a wire), placed 40 mm above a flat cathode plate in ambient air. A positive high voltage pulse {{is applied to the}} anode, creating a positive corona discharge. This discharge is studied with a fast ICCD camera, in many cases combined with optics to enable stereoscopic imaging. We find that reconnections as defined above occur frequently. Merging on the other hand was only observed at a pressure of 25 mbar and a tip separation of 2 mm, i. e. for a reduced tip distance of p Â· d = 50 Âµm bar. In this case the full width at half maximum of the streamer channel is more than 10 times as large as the tip separation. At higher pressures or with a wire anode, merging was not observed.
