500|$|Parker met actress Eva Longoria, {{seven years}} his senior, in November 2004. In August 2005, Longoria {{confirmed}} she and Parker were dating, and on 30 November 2006, the couple became engaged. Longoria, a Texas native from nearby Corpus Christi, was a courtside regular at Spurs home games. Parker was quoted during the 2007 NBA All-Star Game saying that, [...] "Eva is doing everything, I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> and say yes." [...] They were officially {{married in a}} civil service on 6 July 2007, at a Paris city hall. It {{was followed by a}} full Roman Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church in Paris, France, on 7 July 2007. Fellow Frenchman NBA player (and future teammate) Boris Diaw was Parker's best man for the wedding.|$|E
500|$|Mark Valley {{returns as}} John Scott. The actor stated {{that despite the}} character's death in the pilot; [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> in the first season. And, {{for a guy who}} died in the pilot, I {{consider}} myself pretty fortunate." [...] Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story.|$|R
60|$|But I {{think there}} is a limit, and a highly {{legitimate}} limit, to this process. I think a man may praise Pindar without knowing the top of a Greek letter from the bottom. But I think that if a man is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> abuse Pindar, if he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce, refute, and utterly expose Pindar, if he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Pindar <b>up</b> as the utter ignoramus and outrageous impostor that he is, then I think it will be just as well perhaps--I think, at any rate, it would do no harm--if he did know a little Greek, and even had read a little Pindar. And I think the same situation would be involved if the critic were concerned to point out that Pindar was scandalously immoral, pestilently cynical, or low and beastly in his views of life. When people brought such attacks against the morality of Pindar, I should regret that they could not read Greek; and when they bring such attacks against the morality of Fielding, I regret very much that they cannot read English.|$|R
5000|$|Original Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon also {{appeared}} on the tour. Walsh stated, [...] "Bernie's brilliant, I never really {{got a chance to}} play with him, but we've been in contact. We see him from time to time, and I'm really glad he's coming because it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the <b>show</b> <b>up</b> a notch, and I'm really looking forward to playing with him, finally." [...] It has been reported that former members Randy Meisner and Don Felder will not appear. Meisner had been invited but could not participate due to health problems, while Felder was reportedly not invited due to ongoing legal disputes with the band.|$|R
2500|$|With Sting gone, the storyline {{continued}} with Jeff Jarrett and Eric Young worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending Alex Shelley to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then {{walked up to}} Shelley's car {{and told him that}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at Destination X and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in [...] "street clothes" [...] and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by Jarrett's Army. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting Scott Steiner shortly thereafter. In his first cable television match in five years, Sting defeated Eric Young on the April 13, 2006 episode of Impact!. After being attacked by Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), Sting was saved by A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino, who he announced as his teammates in his Lethal Lockdown match against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at Lockdown, [...] "Sting's Warriors" [...] (Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino) defeated Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted after Sting made Chris Harris tap out to the Scorpion Death Lock. Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Rick Steiner as options, he settled on Samoa Joe. On May 14 at Sacrifice, Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster. Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee Earl Hebner to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

While searching for Sarah, Bo was assisted by FBI agent Alex Olanov (Tonja Walker) who later turned out to be mentally unbalanced, and developed an obsessive fixation on Bo. When Bo began dating Dorianâ€™s daughter Cassie (who was SORAS-ed to be Boâ€™s age, and played by Laura Koffman), Alex flipped out and tried to kill her.

50|$|Editor Roy Thomas, {{in charge}} of {{reviving}} the X-Men for Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975), told the creative team {{to go home and}} create some characters for the new team. Dave Cockrum recalled:I just went home and Colossus {{was one of the first}} ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character's armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as-is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> him armored <b>up,</b> the legs should be bare like the arms. But Len Wein didn't like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn't armored up, and that we'd see his legs when he was armored up, due to the unstable molecules of his costume.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the series, he is at an {{expensive}} boarding school, but is suspended after punching a bully. It is revealed to the viewers that he got himself suspended on purpose so that he could see his secret girlfriend, Olive, on his 18th Birthday. Olive (who is three years younger than him) has bought tickets for them to go to Paris, but Stephen has doubts about it, especially when he finds out that the tickets are one-way. It is revealed to the viewers that he has another girlfriend, Rosa, who doesn't know about Olive. As Olive and Stephen are about to leave for Paris, Rosa turns up on the platform, humiliating Olive and causing her to dump Stephen. As the series progresses, Rosa and Stephen still have a relationship, but it is clear to the viewers that he is not sure if he prefers her or Olive. When he deliberately takes Rosa to an event that Olive is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Olive <b>up,</b> they both dump Stephen and he is left alone. In later episodes, he becomes close to Fin, and after getting drunk together, they end up kissing. Near to the end of Series 1, he asks Fin out to a school party, but when he finds out that Tommy is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask Olive, he goes to ask her instead, which she eventually agrees to. Stephen cannot bring himself to tell Fin that he's not going with her after all, and leaves her waiting {{on the night of the}} party. He also claims to have left a necklace for Olive in the cafe, which was actually left by Tommy. Fin turns up halfway through the party and tells Olive what is really going on. Tommy and Stephen get into a fight, resulting in Stephen leaving the party alone, as all of his friends have turned against him.|$|R
