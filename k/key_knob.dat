40|$|Locks are {{mechanical}} fastening devices used on {{various kinds of}} objects like doors and vehicles, {{and they can be}} released using a certain type of key. They have a long history, from wood-made Egyptian keys to electronic keys as they are common nowadays, and they are mostly restricted to the basic functionality of selecting one of two states (e. g. locked or unlocked). In many cases however, {{it would be useful to}} have the possibility of multistage or even continuous control also, as it is provided by omnipresent turning knobs. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of a handy knob to which we refer to as <b>key</b> <b>knob,</b> which automatically connects to dedicated devices in close proximity, and enables to control them in both discrete and continuous ways in the case of authorization. We present a prototype, point out its potentials with concrete application scenarios, and conclude with an outlook on further improvements of the <b>key</b> <b>knob.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{behaviors}} of resistive {{random access memory}} (RRAM) {{play an important role in}} the design of cross-point memory arrays. A Monte Carlo compact model of oxide RRAM is developed and calibrated with experiments on various device stack configurations. With Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, we show that an increase in array size and interconnect wire resistance will statistically deteriorate write functionality. Write failure probability (WFP) has an exponential dependency on device uniformity and supply voltage (VDD), and the array bias scheme is a <b>key</b> <b>knob.</b> Lowering array VDD leads to higher effective energy consumption (EEC) due to the increase in WFP when the variation statistics are included in the analysis. Random-access simulations indicate that data sparsity statistically benefits write functionality and energy consumption. Finally, we show that a pseudo-sub-array topology with uniformly distributed pre-forming cells in the pristine high resistance state is able to reduce both WFP and EEC, enabling higher net capacity for memory circuits due to improved variation tolerance.

The interface consists of 32 buttons, eight of which are function <b>keys,</b> three <b>knobs,</b> and a four-key directional pad for navigating the 240x64 display, located in the upper-middle portion of the sampler.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWireless home {{networks}} are widely deployed {{due to their}} low cost, ease of installation, and plug-and-play capabilities with consumer electronic devices. Management of data across wireless devices is an important challenge in a wireless home environment. This is specially true for continuous media (audio and video clips) which are large in size and delay sensitive. Caching of clips across wireless devices may improve user experience, measurable by different Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as throughput and startup latency. Moreover, Caching {{at the edge of}} the network reduces the demand for the infrastructure outside the home. In this dissertation, we present Domical, a novel cooperative caching technique designed for streaming media in wireless home networks consisting of a handful of devices. Domical is novel because it considers both asymmetry of the available wireless link bandwidth and heterogeneity of the cache space contributed by the participating devices. We present a comprehensive description of Domical, presenting its <b>key</b> <b>knobs</b> and the behavior of the algorithm in different network topologies and granularity of data caching (block versus clip). These results highlight the importance of Domical as a cooperative caching technique for wireless home networks...|$|R

After bending a VCS3 Synth (the [...] "Putney") in {{the early}} 70s to play it with a touchable [...] "crackle" [...] surface, this three voiced instrument became Michel Waisvisz' synthesizer development. It has 12 <b>keys</b> with tuning <b>knobs</b> combined with three crackle-patches.|$|R
30|$|A {{presenting}} {{complaint of}} pain and swelling at the MCP joint following an appropriate history of trauma or repeated strain should alert the clinician {{to the possibility of}} a collateral ligament injury. Patients with chronic injuries frequently mention a history of weakness of pincer grip, holding a pen, grasping objects, unscrewing jar lids, and turning a <b>key</b> or door <b>knob</b> [12, 13].|$|R
5000|$|The late art {{director}} Salah Marei {{worked closely with}} Tamer El Said on the location sets for the film, [...] "he took notice of every little aspect, even the door <b>knobs,</b> <b>keys</b> and keychains.” They looked at more than 60 apartments {{to find the most}} suited one for the film, deciding upon the color of the walls to match the skin tones of the two main actors.|$|R
50|$|The portative is {{constructed}} simply {{in order to}} make it as portable as possible. The pipes are arranged on a small rectangular windchest and supplied with wind by one or two bellows placed at the back, in front or at the right side of the instrument. The row of pipes is supported by posts at either end and an oblique bar. The simplest style of keyboard on the portative consists of one slider for each pipe. When a slider is pushed in, the corresponding pipe sounds. The slider is restored to its normal position by a horn spring. Some instruments use the reverse of this action, with <b>keys</b> featuring <b>knobs</b> or handles.|$|R

50|$|This variant comes {{closest to}} a {{traditional}} Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long at approximately 38 N trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately 20 N trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8 mm (0.3 in) at the same 20 N trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock <b>key</b> or <b>knob</b> on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10 mm (0.4 in) back.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} contribution of Geloso were mounting kits. The kits allowed for TVs and radios to be home-assembled almost from scratch, beginning with raw metal frames onto which components were installed. There {{was also a}} user-friendlier line of pre-assembled, pre-calibrated kits and, also available, were cabinets, <b>knobs,</b> <b>keys,</b> etc. - all branded Geloso. Bulletins instructed how to calibrate finished units. By 1969 - the year John Geloso died - S.p.A. Geloso had become an empire of eight manufacturing facilities. Production persisted till 1972, when the business closed. Several were {{the reasons for the}} end of activities: fierce foreign competition, managerial problems, union demands and massive indebtedness to banks.|$|R
40|$|The Squeezables is a {{computer}} music instrument that allows a group of players to perform and improvise musical compositions by using a set of squeezing and pulling gestures. The instrument, comprised of six squeezable and retractable gel balls mounted on a small podium, addresses a number of hardware and software challenges in electronic music interface design. It {{is designed to provide}} an alternative to asynchronous and discursive interactions with discrete musical controllers by allowing multiple channels of high-level simultaneous input. The instrument also addresses new challenges in interconnected group playing by providing an infrastructure for the development of interdependent, yet coherent, multi-player interactions. As a test case for a particular highlevel control and interdependent mapping scheme, a short musical composition was written for the instrument and was performed by three players. This article presents a critical evaluation of the composition, the performance, and the mapping design, which leads toward a number of suggestions for improvements and future research. Goals and Challenges Electronic musical instruments that use controllers such as <b>keys,</b> buttons, <b>knobs,</b> and menus tend to favor sequential operations by the performer that promote a discursive manipulation of musical parameters. While serving an effective and practical function, such asynchronous interactions might also impair flow and musical expressivity whe...|$|R
50|$|The {{little brother}} of the Ion is the Alesis Micron, which is {{extremely}} compact and portable. It came out in 2004 with almost the same synthesis engine and the same metal/plastic housing style as the Ion, but with only 37 <b>keys</b> and fewer <b>knobs</b> and buttons. It boasts reverb, long delay, and a pattern sequencer. Sound patches for the Ion {{can be used on}} the Micron and vice versa. The Micron's user interface features many shortcuts and is quite deep, offering users the ability to edit all of the sound engine's parameters. However, {{due to the lack of}} knobs on its control surface compared to the Ion, specialised Micron patch editor software has been made for various platforms to enable easier sound sculpting from a computer via MIDI.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously the man {{approached}} {{the door of}} the lad's room. There he crouched listening until assured by the regular breathing of those within that both slept. Quietly he inserted a slim, skeleton key in the lock of the door. With deft fingers, long accustomed to the silent manipulation of the bars and bolts that guarded other men's property, Condon turned the <b>key</b> and the <b>knob</b> simultaneously. Gentle pressure upon the door swung it slowly inward upon its hinges. The man entered the room, closing the door behind him. The moon was temporarily overcast by heavy clouds. The interior of the apartment was shrouded in gloom. Condon groped his way toward the bed. In {{the far corner of the}} room something moved--moved with a silent stealthiness which transcended even the trained silence of the burglar. Condon heard nothing. His attention was riveted upon the bed in which he thought to find a young boy and his helpless, invalid grandmother.|$|R
30|$|Many {{bacterial}} {{infections are}} transmitted by contact with door <b>knobs,</b> <b>key</b> boards, water taps, bath tubs, and telephones; therefore, {{it is essential}} to develop and coat such surfaces with inexpensive advanced antibacterial substances so that their growth is inhibited. It is important to use such concentrations of antibacterial substances that they may kill the pathogens but spare the human beings. It may happen only if they are coated with a biocompatible hydrophilic polymer of low cost. Schwartz et al. [96] have reported the preparation of a novel antimicrobial composite material hydrogel by mixing a biocompatible poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) with zinc oxide nanoparticles. The SEM image of the composite film showed uniform distribution of zinc oxide nanoparticles. It exhibited antibacterial activity against E. coli at a very low zinc oxide concentration (1.33  mM). Also, the coating was found to be nontoxic toward mammalian cell line (N 1 H/ 3 T 3) for a period of 1  week. Zinc oxide/hydrogel nanocomposite may safely be used as biomedical coating to prevent people from contracting bacterial infections.|$|R
40|$|Background: Kinetic {{models of}} {{biochemical}} systems usually consist of ordinary differential equations that have many unknown parameters. Some of these parameters are often practically unidentifiable, that is, their values cannot be uniquely determined from the available data. Possible causes are lack of {{influence on the}} measured outputs, interdependence among parameters, and poor data quality. Uncorrelated parameters {{can be seen as}} the <b>key</b> tuning <b>knobs</b> of a predictive model. Therefore, before attempting to perform parameter estimation (model calibration) it is important to characterize the subset(s) of identifiable parameters and their interplay. Once this is achieved, it is still necessary to perform parameter estimation, which poses additional challenges. Methods: We present a methodology that (i) detects high-order relationships among parameters, and (ii) visualizes the results to facilitate further analysis. We use a collinearity index to quantify the correlation between parameters in a group in a computationally efficient way. Then we apply integer optimization to find the largest groups of uncorrelated parameters. We also use the collinearity index to identify small groups of highly correlated parameters. The results files can be visualized using Cytoscape, showing the identifiable and non-identifiable groups of parameters together with the model structure in the same graph. Results: Our contributions alleviate the difficulties that appear at different stages of the identifiability analysis and parameter estimation process. We show how to combine global optimization and regularization techniques for calibrating medium and large scale biological models with moderate computation times. Then we evaluate the practical identifiability of the estimated parameters using the proposed methodology. The identifiability analysis techniques are implemented as a MATLAB toolbox called VisId, which is freely available as open source from GitHub ([URL] Our approach is geared towards scalability. It enables the practical identifiability analysis of dynamic models of large size, and accelerates their calibration. The visualization tool allows modellers to detect parts that are problematic and need refinement or reformulation, and provides experimentalists with information that can be helpful in the design of new experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the surface {{deformations}} of erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy at two stages of the 48 -h parasite maturation cycle. Infected cells bearing trophozoite-stage parasites (24 - 36 h) had small protrusions (knobs), with diameters varying from 160 to 110 nm, and a density ranging from 10 to 35 knobs X micron- 2. When parasites were fully mature (schizont stage, 40 - 44 h), knob size decreased (100 - 70 nm), whereas density increased (45 - 70 knobs X micron- 2). Size and density of the knobs varied inversely, suggesting that knob production (a) occurred throughout intraerythrocytic parasite development from trophozoite to schizont and (b) was related to dynamic changes of the erythrocyte membrane. Variation {{in the distribution of}} the knobs over the red cell surface was observed during parasite maturation. At the early trophozoite stage of parasite development, knobs appeared to be formed in particular domains of the cell surface. As the density of knobs increased and they covered the entire cell surface, their lateral distribution was dispersive (more-than-random); this was particularly evident at the schizont stage. Regional surface patterns of knobs (rows, circles) were seen throughout parasite development. The {{nature of the}} dynamic changes that occurred at the red cell surface during knob formation, as well as the nonrandom distribution of knobs, suggested that the red cell cytoskeleton may have played a <b>key</b> role in <b>knob</b> formation and patterning...|$|R
