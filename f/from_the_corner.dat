The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E

The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built.

5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however {{later in the year}} the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City started sprightly, {{managing}} {{to create some}} chances which forced saves from Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen and steady defending to keep Stoke City in {{the game in the}} first half.

At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the scene.

5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept him away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit {{each other at the}} same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody {{from the top}} turnbuckle. Bigelow used his weight to keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a bear hug to wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance. Bigelow kicked Tatanka {{in the back of}} the head to regain the advantage but missed a moonsault attempt from the top rope, allowing Tatanka to perform a crossbody <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{started with}} a 4–4–2 {{formation}} and it was Liverpool that kicked the final off. Five minutes into the match, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne and Leeds captain Bobby Collins collided, which resulted in Byrne breaking his collarbone. As substitutions were not allowed, Byrne decided to continue playing. He {{was unaware of the}} extent of his injury, as manager Shankly decided against telling him. The first action of the match was from a Liverpool free-kick, which Willie Stevenson played into the Leeds penalty area. Leeds goalkeeper Gary Sprake and defender Jack Charlton did not deal with it and it went out of play for a Liverpool corner. Liverpool captain Ron Yeats headed the ball on <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> and striker Ian St. John was close to reaching it, before it was gathered by Sprake. Leeds were trying to get winger Albert Johanneson into the match, but a pass to him from Johnny Giles was intercepted by Liverpool defender Tommy Smith. He passed to Ian Callaghan, who advanced before passing to Stevenson, he and Smith exchanged passes before Stevenson passed to Callaghan, whose shot was saved by Sprake.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–04, Morrison {{registered}} 22 {{goals and}} 60 points over 82 games as {{all members of}} the Canucks' top line experienced declines in offensive production. Bertuzzi was replaced on Morrison's wing after he was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for sucker punching Steve Moore in a game against Colorado in March 2004; he was replaced on the Canucks' top line by Matt Cooke. Nonetheless, the Canucks won their first-ever Northwest Division title and went into the 2004 playoffs as the West's third seed. Facing elimination in game six of the opening round against the Calgary Flames, Morrison scored there minutes into the contest's third overtime session to force a seventh game. Having skated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> boards with the puck, Morrison stickhandled across the net and scored past Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. The Canucks were then eliminated in Game 7; Morrison finished the playoff season with five points. Becoming a restricted free agent in the off-season, he filed for salary arbitration against the Canucks {{for the second time in}} two years. Both sides managed to avoid their hearing by agreeing to a one-year deal on July 27, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E

MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
5|$|Hicks, who was {{generally}} {{described as the}} most effective of the Manchester City forwards, had a chance which he hit high over the crossbar. In a rare spell of sustained Manchester City pressure, a free kick by captain Jimmy McMullan forced a save from Pym, and the resulting near-post corner prompted a goalmouth scramble which ended with a foul on Bolton's Greenhalgh. Pym made further saves from Browell and Hicks, the latter resulting in a corner. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> Bolton won the ball and headed upfield on the counter-attack. Billy Butler's cross from the right went beyond the goal and was retrieved by Vizard on the left wing. The outside-forward then cut inside and played the ball across goal in a manner described by some correspondents as a shot and others as a pass. David Jack received {{the ball in the}} six-yard box and put the ball between Goodchild and McCloy into the City goal, giving Bolton the lead with 14 minutes remaining. In the few minutes after the goal, Manchester City came forward in numbers but lacked clear chances and were hindered by over-eager forwards going offside. Following a goal kick by Pym, the referee blew the final whistle. Bolton won the cup for a second time, becoming the first club to win twice at Wembley.|$|E
