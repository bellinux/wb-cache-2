5000|$|A {{new design}} with more legible seated Helvetia {{appeared}} in 1862, now sporting a [...] "watermark" [...] {{consisting of a}} cross inside an ellipse (not a true watermark because it was impressed into the paper after printing), {{and for the first}} time, perforations. The units of currency disappeared, with [...] "HELVETIA" [...] inscribed at the top and [...] "FRANCO" [...] at the bottom. Initially printed on white wove paper, the stamps switched to <b>granite</b> <b>paper</b> in 1881. (The paper has red and blue silk threads, clearly visible in the larger image of the stamp to the left.) The stamps continued in use until 1883; many of them are common and cheaply available today, although legitimate cancellations on the <b>granite</b> <b>paper</b> varieties are uncommon because of the short period of use.|$|E
50|$|The mill {{provided}} {{jobs and}} paper for nearly ten years. But {{the completion of}} the railroad had made paper significantly cheaper to obtain. In 1892, the Cottonwood Paper Mill was sold to <b>Granite</b> <b>Paper</b> Mills Company. On April 1, 1893, a fire broke out inside. Between its large stockpile of paper and the fact that many who heard the alarm thought it to be an April Fool's joke, the mill was destroyed, leaving only a stone skeleton.|$|E
50|$|Two {{aluminium}} smelters, Hillside Aluminum and Bayside Aluminium are {{operated by}} BHP Billiton. BHP has recently sold {{their interest in}} Hillside to South32. A fertiliser plant operated by Foskor has been erected at the harbour. Iron ore, rutile (titanium oxide) and zircon are mined from the sand dunes close to the lagoon by Richards Bay Minerals, {{a part of the}} Rio Tinto group. Local exports include coal, aluminium, titanium and other heavy minerals, <b>granite,</b> ferrochrome, <b>paper</b> pulp, woodchips and phosphoric acid. Richards Bay is, alongside Rustenberg, South Africa's fastest-developing city. It is a fast-growing industrial centre that has been able to maintain its ecological diversity.|$|R

They are {{situated}} in the Rio Parana and the Rio Tocantins sub-provinces. They are very similar in mineralogy, geochemistry, and age of emplacement, to the Arai rhyolites.

40|$|One way to {{alleviate}} the environmental problem associated with the disposal of granite processing waste is to utilize this material as aggregate in concrete manufacturing or as raw material for producing concentrates {{to be used in}} the ceramics industry. Based on the results of material characterization and amenability tests conducted on Sardinian <b>granite</b> waste, the <b>paper</b> demonstrates the potential utilization of this type of material as a concrete ingredient and in cement blends. Likewise, the application of basic mineral processing techniques, such as magnetic separation, integrated where necessary with flotation, showed that the beneficiated products of the same granite waste as well as of road tunnelling waste should find a ready market in the ceramics industry...|$|R
50|$|The Cottonwood Paper Mill (also {{known as}} <b>Granite</b> <b>Paper</b> Mill) is an {{abandoned}} stone structure {{located at the}} mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. It was built in 1883 by the Deseret News under the direction of Henry Grow. Workers used paper making equipment brought in from the old Sugar House Paper Mill to grind logs from nearby canyons into pulp. Rags gathered from old clothes were also used to produce the pulp, which was then placed into molds and dried. During its operation, the mill could yield up to 5 tons of paper per day.|$|E
50|$|Since {{its first}} {{publication}} the News had been owned {{directly by the}} LDS Church, but as worries about property confiscation increased due to the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act and Poland Act, and the paper's ownership was transferred to The Deseret News Company after it was incorporated on September 3, 1880. About this same time the News began looking for a location {{to build a new}} paper mill, as the Sugar House paper plant was not adequate. A new granite plant was constructed near the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, 13 miles south of the paper's offices. The mill began producing paper in April 1883, and was known as the Cottonwood Paper Mill. The News would sell the paper mill in 1892 to the <b>Granite</b> <b>Paper</b> Mills Company. The mill caught fire and was destroyed April 1, 1893.|$|E
40|$|The {{granitic}} {{rocks of}} the peninsula have traditionally been divided into two provinces, i. e., Western and Eastern provinces, corresponding to S- and I-type granite respectively. The Western Province granite is characterised by megacrystic and coarse-grained biotite, tin-mineralised, continental collision granite, whereas, the Eastern Province granite is bimodal I-type dominated by granodiorite and associated gabbroic of arc type <b>granite.</b> This <b>paper</b> reports the occurrence of an A-type granite from peninsular Malaysia. The rocks occur in the Besar, Tengah, and Hujung islands located in the southeastern part {{of the peninsula}}. The granite is highly felsic with SiO 2 ranging from 75. 70 % to 77. 90 % (differentiation index = 94. 2 – 97. 04). It is weakly peraluminous (average ACNK = 1. 02), has normative hypersthene (0. 09 – 2. 19 %) and high alkali content (8. 32 – 8. 60 %). The granites have many A-type characteristics, among them are shallow level of emplacement, high Ga, FeT/MgO and low P, Sr, Ti, CaO and Nb. Calculated zircon saturation temperatures for the Besar magma ranging from 793 ∘ to 806 ∘C is consistent with high temperature partial melting of a felsic infracrustal source which is taken {{as one of the}} mechanisms to produce A-type magma. The occurrence of the A-type granite can be related to the extensional back arc basin in the Indo-China terrane during the earliest Permian...|$|R
40|$|In {{south-western}} Norway, the Sveconorwegian orogenic thickening (1024 – 970 Ma) {{is followed}} by an important post-collisional magmatism (950 – 930 Ma), divided in two suites (Vander Auwera et al., 2003) : the Anorthosite–Mangerite–Charnockite suite (AMC suite) and the Hornblende–Biotite Granitoids suite (HBG suite). The HBG suite displays a continuous trend from gabbronorites to <b>granites.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents the petrography and geochemistry (major and trace elements, Sr–Nd isotopes) of the Lyngdal granodiorite and associated massifs (Tranevåg and Red Granite massifs) which belong to the HBG suite, although being {{very close to the}} anorthosite massifs. Mafic microgranular enclaves (MME), resulting from magma mingling, can be abundant and probably correspond to the parent magma of the studied plutons. The Lyngdal granodiorite and associated massifs are subalkaline, metaluminous A-type granitoids with high FeOt/(FeOt+MgO) ratio and K 2 O content, forming a ferro-potassic A-type continuous trend from quartz monzodiorite to granite (56 – 72 wt. % SiO 2). In Harker diagrams, the Lyngdal–Tranevåg plutons share the Proterozoic rapakivi granites trend that they extend to lower SiO 2 content. Major and trace element modelling, as well as Sr–Nd isotopes, show that fractional crystallisation—without assimilation—is the differentiation process for Lyngdal–Tranevåg. Fractionating minerals are clinopyroxene, hornblende, plagioclase, oxides, biotite, apatite, zircon and allanite. The Red Granite (71 – 75 wt. % SiO 2) does not belong to this trend probably due to a different initial magma composition. This study shows that ferro-potassic A-type granitoids can be derived by fractional crystallisation from mafic magmas...|$|R

Time:July 27, 2013 - July 28, 2013. In south China, {{residual}} soil is widely distributed {{and one of}} the most main soil in engineering construction at the coastal areas. While it's mechanical characteristics are easily affected by moisture content, which is a serious threat to engineering stability and safety. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>granite</b> {{residual soil}} in a construction site of Xiamen is selected as remoulded specimens, and unconfined compressive strength test and static triaxial shear test are used, which will show the influence of moisture content (20 %, 23 % and 26 %) on the mechanical properties of specimens. As the result is analyzed, it shows that mechanical properties such as stress-strain relationship, unconfined compression strength, internal cohesive force, internal friction angle, and shear strength, are better than other specimens when the moisture content is 23 %, which will be beneficial to the stability and security of engineering soil. ?

40|$|Artisanal {{fishermen}} of Trivandrum area in South India {{are showing}} keen interest {{to put up}} artificial reefs to enhance fish production. Non-govenunental organisations working {{for the welfare of}} coastal fishermen are giving financial and moral support to these fishermen to deploy more and more artificial reefs. The results of a study made on such reefs are presented in this <b>paper.</b> <b>Granite</b> stones, truck tyres, coconut tree stumps, concrete well rings and concrete slabs are used for the construction of artificial reefs in this area. A gradual increase in the annual fish catch was noticed at Valiathura (Trivandrum) fish landing centre after the establishment of artificial reefs in this area. It rose from 669. 0 tormes in the year 1988 to 857. 5 tormes in 1989 and to 1442. 8 toimes in 1990. Sepia pharaonis was the major component in the catches from these reefs. Carangoides plagiotaenia, C. ntalabarictis, Lethrinus harak, Selar kalla and Selaroides leptolepis were caught only from the artificial reef region at a point of time. Underwater studies revealed the congregation of large shoals of small reef-dwelling fishes and other bottom living animals around the reefs...|$|R
40|$|Rural’ ecclesiae laicorum have {{remained}} mute witnesses of our history; {{they have been}} deserted, forgotten and frequently falling into ruin. Single-nave Romanesque churches from the territories of Poland have not been much interest for the scholars of the Middle Ages. A full monograph on such churches from Greater Poland has not been written yet. This remains in a striking opposition to analogues buildings from Western Pomerania, Silesia or the New March. The only incomplete and {{to a large extent}} outdated work on this subject is Stanisław Wiliński’s <b>paper</b> <b>Granite</b> village churches of 12 th century in Greater Poland or an exiguous paper by Alicja Karłowska- Kamzowa addressing the question of their foundation. The main aim of my book is the presentation of single-nave churches from Greater Poland erected in the period between {{the second half of the}} eleventh century and the end of the thirteenth century, in their historical and settlement context. Only churches that have been subject to archeological excavations have been included. Therefore, two factors determined whether a church has been chosen and included in this study: firstly, some archeological excavations must have been carried out within it, and secondly, the church must have played a basic role as a Christianization centre for ‘rural’ areas...|$|R
40|$|Xichong Mo deposit {{is located}} in Yuexi county of Anhui province, China, {{which is in the}} east part of Tongbai - Dabie metallogenic belt. A series of giant and large {{porphyry}} Mo deposits have been reported in this belt including Shapinggou, Qian'e'chong, Tangjiaping Yaochong and Xichong etc. （Fig. 1 ）, as well as some Au, Pb-Zn deposits. The geology, geochronology and geochemistry of key porphyry Mo deposits in this belts have been reported by Yang (2009), Meng et al. (2012), Zhang et al. (2011), Zhang et al. (2012), Chen et al. (2013), Li et al. (2011), Huang et al. (2011), Gao et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2014). Most of these researchs is for Shapinggou, Qian'e'chong, Tangjiaping and Yaochong, no much for Xichong deposit. Based on field observation, petrographic, ore-microscopic, SEM/EDS, XRD results together with chronology and petrochemical results of fine grained <b>granite</b> (FGG), this <b>paper</b> discusses the alteration, minerlization and the genetic link between FGG and Mo - Cu mineralization in Xichong deposit. The results show that Yanshanian FGG formed at the starting of regional extentional and is closely related to Mo - Cu mineralization. The potassic-silification represents the early alteration and followed by sericite - quartz alteration propylitization and argillation. The Mo-Cu mineralization is closely related to propylitization. Late stage Cu mineralization is related to argillation...|$|R
40|$|The Gaofengshan granite {{is located}} {{in the eastern part of}} the Gejiu ore district, Yunnan Province. The {{lithology}} of the granitoid is mainly medium grained biotite monzonitic <b>granite.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> zircon U-Pb dating and geochemistry of the Gaofengshan granite is studied to constrain its geochronology and petrogenesis. Zircon LA-ICP-MS dating yields an emplacement age of 85. 76 ± 0. 58 Ma, which suggests that this granite formed in the Late Cretaceous. Geochemically, this granite is silica riched in composition, with high content of alkali (Na 2 O + K 2 O). It' s a metaluminous to peraluminous granite and belongs to the high-K calc-alkaline series, and characterized by enrichment of Rb, U, Ta, Pb, Nd and depletion of Ba, Nb, Sr, P, Zr, Eu, Ti. The abundance of ∑REE varies in the range of 146. 7 × 10 - 6 to 236. 1 × 10 - 6, and it has intensely negative Eu abnormality (δEu = 0. 03 ∼ 0. 11). What's more, it reflects a tetrad-like effect with a shape of "M". These features are coincident with A 2 granite. Geochemical characteristics show that the parental magma of the Gaofengshan granite was derived from the partial melting of crust, and experienced a strong crystal fractionation process. New data of this study indicate that the Gaofengshan granite was one component of the large scale Late Cretaceous magmatism in western Cathaysia block, which viewed as under a regional lithospheric extension tectonic setting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Discrete Element Method (DEM) is {{increasingly}} used {{to simulate the}} behavior of rock. Despite their intrinsic capability to model fracture initiation and propagation starting from simple interaction laws, classical DEM formulations using spherical discrete elements suffer from an intrinsic limitation to properly simulate brittle rock behavior characterized by high values of UCS/TS ratio associated with non-linear failure envelopes, as observed for hard rock like <b>granite.</b> The present <b>paper</b> shows that the increase of the interaction range between the spherical discrete elements, which increases locally the density of interaction forces (or interparticle bonds), can overcome this limitation. It is argued that this solution represents a way to implicitly {{take into account the}} degree of interlocking associated to the microstructural complexity of rock. It is thus shown that increasing the degree of interlocking between the discrete elements which represent the rock medium, in addition to enhancing the UCS/TS ratio, results in a non-linear failure envelop characteristic of low porous rocks. This approach improves significantly the potential and predictive capabilities of the DEM for rock modeling purpose. A special emphasis is put on the model ability to capture the fundamental characteristics of brittle rocks in terms of fracture initiation and propagation. The model can reproduce an essential component of brittle rock failure, that is, cohesion weakening and frictional strengthening as a function of rock damage or plastic strain. Based on model predictions, it is finally discussed that frictional strengthening may be at the origin of the brittle ductile transition occurring at high confining pressures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Xuefengshan Belt, {{characterized}} by large-scale fold and thrust structures and widespread granites, {{is a key}} area to decipher the tectonic evolution of the South China block. In this belt, two magmatic episodes are recorded by Early Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic <b>granites.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we carried out precise SIMS zircon Usingle bondPb dating and in situ Lusingle bondHf isotopes measurements on these granitic plutons. Our study indicates that the Early Paleozoic and the Early Mesozoic granites are late-orogenic products of the Early Paleozoic orogen and the Middle Triassic Xuefengshan orogen, respectively. In the Xuefengshan Belt, the Early Paleozoic event is poorly registered, since this area corresponds to the outer zone of the early Paleozoic orogen. The Silurian-Early Devonian granites are late-orogenic plutons emplaced after the main tectonic and metamorphic stage in the Wuyi-Baiyun-Yunkai belt, coeval with a widespread, subsequent extensional event in eastern and southern South China. On the other hand, Triassic granites are formed in an intracontinental environment with weakly to strongly peraluminous signatures. Zircon Usingle bondPb ages presented here, associated with a summary of newly acquired data in the same region, suggest that the emplacement of anatectic granites occurred around 225 - 215 Ma, not in a rather wide range of ca. 245 - 200 Ma. In situ zircon εHf(t) values indicate a crust-derived source without a mantle-derived input for the two generations of granites. Combining our data with recent studies, we infer that the central area of the South China block has experienced two tectonothermal events: the Early Paleozoic magmatism developed {{as a result of}} the collapse of the Early Paleozoic orogen, while these Early Mesozoic granites can be the late-orogenic products of the intracontinental Xuefengshan orogen, most likely manifesting the far field effect by th...|$|R
