40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{the current}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the role of}} noradrenaline in <b>directing</b> (<b>bias)</b> and disengagement of visuospatial attention. METHODS: We assessed the effect of clonidine on event-related brain potential (ERP) reflections of bias and disengagement in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. An initial dose of 200 -μg clonidine was replaced by 100 μg because of marked side effects. Twenty-one healthy male participants performed the visual-spatial cueing task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The behavioral output is the validity effect (benefit of cueing in terms of reaction time to targets). ERP indices for bias were the cue-related early directing attention negativity and late directing attention positivity, and the target-elicited P 1 and N 1 modulations by validity ('validity-effect'). The ERP index for disengagement was the target-elicited 'late positive deflection' modulation by validity. Behavioral analyses were performed on 16 participants, electrophysiological analyses on a subset (n= 9). RESULTS: Clonidine attenuated the N 1 effect, albeit in a subsample. Neither cue-elicited ERPs nor the behavioral validity effect were affected. Clonidine-induced blood pressure reduction was correlated with {{the reduction of the}} late positive deflection effect under clonidine.

This effect leads to an unpolarized current for <b>direct</b> <b>bias</b> (V > 0) and polarized current for reverse (V 0 and V < 0.

The characterization consists in investigations of transient electrical {{processes in the}} diode sources under heating by direct current. The time dependence of the heating temperature of the active region of a source ∆T(t), calculated from <b>direct</b> <b>bias</b> change, is analyzed using a thermal RTCT equivalent circuit (the Foster and Cauer models), where RT is the {{thermal resistance}} and CT is the heat capacity of the source elements and external heat sink.

The dominant contribution of a die attach layer to the internal thermal resistance of both heterolaser sources and light-emitting diodes is observed. Based on the performed thermal characterization, the dependence of the optical power efficiency on current for the laser diodes is determined.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{a variety}} of {{relevance}} feedback (RF) schemes {{have been developed to}} improve the performance of content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Given user feedback information, the key to a RF scheme is how to select a subset of image features to construct a suitable dissimilarity measure. Among various RF schemes, biased discriminant analysis (BDA) based RF {{is one of the most}} promising. It is based on the observation that all positive samples are alike, while in general each negative sample is negative in its own way. However, to use BDA, the small sample size (SSS) problem is a big challenge, as users tend to give a small number of feedback samples. To explore solutions to this issue, this paper proposes a direct kernel BDA (DKBDA), which is less sensitive to SSS. An incremental DKBDA (IDKBDA) is also developed to speed up the analysis. Experimental results are reported on a real-world image collection to demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the traditional kernel BDA (KBDA) and the support vector machine (SVM) based RF algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the small sample}} properties of the mean group estimator of the long-run coefficients in dynamic heterogeneous panels, and using Monte Carlo techniques examines {{the effectiveness of a}} number of alternative bias-correction procedures in reducing the small sample bias of these estimators. Four different biascorrected estimators of the long-run coefficients are considered. A “naïve ” procedure which attempts to bias-correct the estimator of the long-run coefficients by using the bias-corrected estimators of the short-run coefficients proposed by Kiviet and Phillips (1993, Econometric Theory). Two variations of a direct approach which derives biascorrections of the estimators of the long-run coefficients allowing for the variance and covariances of the short-run coefficients, referred to as DBC 1 and DBC 2, and a bootstrap bias-correction procedure. The “naïve ” bias-corrected estimator fails in all cases, and the bootstrap method performs poorly in cases where the true coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is relatively large. Both of the <b>direct</b> <b>biased</b> corrected estimators perform reasonably well, although only the DBC 1 estimator which allows for some higher order bias correction terms out-performs the bootstrap method. None of the estimators seem to be effective when the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is around 0. 8...|$|R

Model performance was acceptable using a combined multi-variety peach–nectarine data set, but it was advantageous to maintain a separate multi-variety plum model. Model robustness to temperature was achieved by including into the calibration set samples scanned at a range of temperatures, with less than 5 % of total population required to be treated in this way. Similarly, where models incorporated the range of TSS seen in the validation population, prediction performance was good.

The study presented here examined the shear angles of out-of-autoclave 8 -harness satin woven carbon/epoxy prepregs under diaphragm compaction. A bias extension test was conducted to study the effect of diaphragm compaction and ply interactions on shear properties.

The contribution of diaphragm material and ply interaction to shear stiffness was evaluated and compared with results from a <b>direct</b> <b>bias</b> extension test. The samples were tested at both room temperature and at elevated temperatures using a radiant heater.
