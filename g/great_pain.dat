5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil <b>great</b> <b>pain,</b> and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E
5|$|Krishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna {{interaction}} {{is missing in}} the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna <b>great</b> <b>pain</b> and then his death.|$|E
5|$|Reagan was in <b>great</b> <b>pain</b> {{from the}} bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E

40|$|Sixty healthy men {{and women}} {{experienced}} experimentally-induced pain during exposure to either a pleasant odour (lemon), an unpleasant odour (machine oil) or no odour. Participants reported the degree of pain they experienced at five minute intervals for 15 minutes. Individuals exposed to both odours reported significantly <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did {{the participants in the}} control condition at five minutes. At 15 minutes, individuals exposed to the unpleasant odour experienced <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did the control group. The results suggest that exposure to odour is not beneficial to those seeking pain relief. Rather, its perception is associated with <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than is no odour...|$|R

5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by <b>great</b> <b>pain</b> {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in <b>great</b> <b>pain</b> and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in <b>great</b> <b>pain,</b> with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E

40|$|A recent trial {{demonstrated}} {{that patients with}} knee osteoarthritis treated with a sodium hyaluronate and corticosteroid combination (Cingal) experienced <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> reductions compared with those treated with sodium hyaluronate alone (Monovisc) or saline up to 3 [*]weeks postinjection. In this study, injections were administered by 1 of 3 approaches; however, there is currently no consensus on which, if any, of these techniques produce a more favorable outcome. To provide additional insight on this topic, {{the results of the}} previous trial were reanalyzed to determine whether (1) the effect of Cingal was significant within each injection technique and (2) pain reductions were similar between injection techniques across all treatment groups. <b>Greater</b> <b>pain</b> reductions with Cingal up to 3 [*]weeks were only significant in the anteromedial subgroup. Across all therapies, both the anteromedial and anterolateral techniques demonstrated significantly <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> reductions than the lateral midpatellar approach at 18 and 26 [*]weeks...|$|R
25|$|He {{was born}} in Berlin and was educated with the {{intention}} of a military career. He entered the artillery of the Guards as an officer in 1860, but was forced to leave in 1865 because of a knee problem. After some hesitation between music and philosophy, he decided to make the latter his profession, and in 1867 obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Rostock. He subsequently returned to Berlin. For many years, he lived a retired life of study, doing most of his work in bed, while suffering <b>great</b> <b>pain.</b> He died at Gross-Lichterfelde and is buried in an honorary grave in the Columbiadamm Cemetery in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|According to Hesiod, Gaia {{conceived}} further offspring with Uranus, {{first the}} giant one-eyed Cyclopes: Brontes ("Thunder"), Steropes ("Lightning") and Arges ("Bright"); then the Hecatonchires: Cottus, Briareos and Gyges, {{each with a}} hundred arms and fifty heads. As each of the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires were born, Uranus hid them in a secret place within Gaia, causing her <b>great</b> <b>pain.</b> So Gaia devised a plan. She created a grey flint (or adamantine) sickle. And Cronus used the sickle to castrate his father Uranus as he approached Gaia {{to have sex with}} her. From Uranus' spilled blood, Gaia produced the Erinyes, the Giants and the Meliae (ash-tree nymphs). From the testicles of Uranus in the sea came forth Aphrodite.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 1856, Dominic asked John Bosco {{permission}} to go home, saying {{that his mother was}} ill, though he had received no communication. Dominic's mother was then expecting a baby and was in <b>great</b> <b>pain,</b> and when Dominic reached the house, he hugged and kissed his mother, and then left. His mother felt her pain leave her and Dominic's baby sister, Catherine was born. The women assisting at the birth found that Dominic had left a green scapular around his mother's neck. His sister Theresa later wore this same scapular when she was in labour. She testified that it had been passed around to several other pregnant women and was later lost.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 2004, {{the names}} and identities of seven of the assailants became known, after {{forensic}} work {{over the weekend and}} interviews with surviving hostages and a captured assailant. The forensic tests also established that 21 of the hostage-takers took heroin, Methamphetamine as well as morphine in a normally lethal amount; the investigation cited the use of drugs as a reason for the militants' ability to continue fighting despite being badly wounded and presumably in <b>great</b> <b>pain.</b> In November 2004, Russian officials announced that 27 of the 32 hostage-takers had been identified. However, in September 2005, the lead prosecutor against Nur-Pashi Kulayev stated that only 22 of the 32 bodies of the captors had been identified, leading to further confusion over which identities have been confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} notable {{residents}} of St Buryan during the seventeenth century was one William Noy, an MP (Grampound 1603–1614, Fowey 1623–1625 and Helston 1627–1631) and member of the court of King Charles I, who was born and lived on the Pendrea estate within the parish. He was created Attorney-general to the king in October 1631 and specialised in reviving long forgotten taxes to raise money to fund the King's lifestyle during his period of Personal Rule. His advice controversially led to the imposition of ship money which is thought by many to have helped trigger the English Civil War. Noy suffered from stones, and died in <b>great</b> <b>pain</b> before being buried at the church in New Brentford in 1634.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} that followed, Mussorgsky's decline became {{increasingly}} steep. Although now {{part of a new}} circle of eminent personages that included singers, medical men and actors, he was increasingly unable to resist drinking, and a succession of deaths among his closest associates caused him <b>great</b> <b>pain.</b> At times, however, his alcoholism would seem to be in check, and among the most powerful works composed during his last six years are the four Songs and Dances of Death. His civil service career was made more precarious by his frequent 'illnesses' and absences, and he was fortunate to obtain a transfer to a post (in the Office of Government Control) where his music-loving superior treated him with great leniency – in 1879 even allowing him to spend three months touring twelve cities as a singer's accompanist.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a pleasant and unpleasant ambient odor on the perception of human pain and to test two hypotheses of the role of distraction and attention in pain perception. Method: Sixty healthy men and women experienced experimentally induced pain (cold-pressor test) during exposure to an ambient pleasant odor (lemon), an ambient unpleasant odor (machine oil), or no odor. Participants reported the degree of pain they experienced at 5 -minute intervals for 15 minutes. Results: Individuals exposed to both odors reported significantly <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did those in the control condition at 5 minutes. At 15 minutes, individuals exposed to the unpleasant odor experienced <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than did the control group. Conclusion: The results suggest that exposure to odors judged to be pleasant and unpleasant may not lead to pain relief. Rather, their perception is associated with <b>greater</b> <b>pain</b> than is no odor. The implications for attentional theories of pain are discussed, as are avenues for future research...|$|R

25|$|His {{last years}} were saddened not merely {{by the death}} of many of his closest friends, but by {{increasing}} ill-health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle and some of his latest work is among his best. But he indulged the temptation to alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in <b>great</b> <b>pain,</b> he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.|$|E
25|$|Horseshoes {{have long}} been {{considered}} lucky. They were originally made of iron, a material which was believed to ward off evil spirits, and traditionally were held in place with seven nails, seven being the luckiest number. The superstition acquired a further Christian twist due to a legend surrounding the 10th century saint Dunstan, {{who worked as a}} blacksmith before becoming Archbishop of Canterbury. The legend recounts that, one day, the Devil walked into Dunstan's shop and asked him to shoe his horse. Dunstan pretended not to recognize him, and agreed to the request; but rather than nailing the shoe to the horse's hoof, he nailed it to the Devil's own foot, causing him <b>great</b> <b>pain.</b> Dunstan eventually agreed to remove the shoe, but only after extracting a promise that the Devil would never enter a household with a horseshoe nailed to the door.|$|E
25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, <b>great</b> <b>pain,</b> nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E
