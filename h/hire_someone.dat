The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak) asks him to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> for a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries to be polite, but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to Mr. Bell about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E

25|$|Prohibited {{discrimination}} may include, {{among other}} things, firing or refusing to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> {{based on a}} real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation {{is a change in}} the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.|$|E

500|$|Lady Charlotte {{threatened}} to resign {{so that the}} queen could <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "younger and more fitted for it", a declaration which ended Queen Charlotte's quest to increase her hours. Finch remained at her post. A new sub-governess, Martha Gouldsworthy – hired on Finch's recommendation – now spent frequent time with the princesses, chaperoning and supervising their studies in preparation for their lessons with their teacher Miss Planta. In 1782, the 14th royal child, Prince Alfred, sickened and died at Windsor {{near the age of}} two, despite Lady Charlotte's devoted nursing.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} cheese making course at Washington State University, Dammeier decided {{he needed to}} <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> {{to work with him}} as chief cheesemaker. He hired Brad Sinko, a microbiologist, who {{previously}} had managed his family cheese business of Bandon Cheese in Oregon, before it was acquired by the Tillamook County Creamery Association. According to Dammeier, the artisanal cheese market was underrepresented in Seattle and Washington, and he opened his business in part to encourage more cheese business to grow in the region. In 2000, Washington had nine licensed cheesemakers; this expanded to twenty-eight by 2007. Dammeier compared the growth he expects in artisan cheese to the United States' recent growth in sales of specialty beers: ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, Turner {{was cast}} in a lead part in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) {{opposite}} John Garfield, a film noir based on James M. Cain's debut novel of the same name. Turner reportedly did not get along with Garfield on the set; according to one documentary, when she found he was her male lead, she responded: [...] "Couldn't they at least <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> attractive?" [...] The now-classic film noir marked {{a turning point in}} Turner's career as her first femme fatale role. Reviews of the film, and in particular, Turner's performance, were glowing, with a critic of The New York Times writing it was [...] "the role of her career." [...] Turner commented on the role in 1946: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{education}} economics, screening {{models are}} commonly contrasted with human capital theory. In a screening model {{used to determine}} an applicant's ability to learn, giving preference to applicants who have earned academic degrees reduces the employer's risk of <b>hiring</b> <b>someone</b> with a diminished capacity for learning.|$|R

500|$|Ricardo Iorio was the {{frontman}} and bassist of {{the band}} V8, which broke up in 1987. After its disbandment, Iorio formed Hermética, which had a similar [...] musical style to V8. Initially, he tried to work with Martín Knye, {{a former member of}} Kamikaze, but after two meetings, the idea was abandoned. Iorio then appointed the guitarist Antonio Romano from the band Cerbero, who had been previously considered for V8. Iorio wanted Romano to be both a vocalist and bassist, but his manager Marcelo Tommy persuaded Iorio to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> else. Iorio eventually chose Claudio O'Connor for vocals and Fabián Spataro from the band Mark as drummer. They began to practice at Villa Ballester in 1987. The name {{of the band}} is a reference to hermeticism; Iorio saw similarities between the hermetic doctrine and the context of the Argentine heavy metal.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate run and John Kerry's 2004 presidential run and serving Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a [...] "bundler" [...] of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with Sarah Jessica Parker, the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-per-person dinner at Parker's West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama's first term and Donna Karan {{has been a}}mongst the attendees. In 2013 when Vogues former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumoured to be looking to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> with a political background. Soon after, Wintour hired Hildy Kuryk, a former fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama's first campaign. She supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential Campaign, forming part of Clinton's long list of wealthy donors or [...] "Hillblazers" [...] as well as serving as Clinton's consultant [...] on her wardrobe choices for key moments of the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Beshear {{clashed with}} the state Council on Postsecondary Education over its hiring of Brad Cowgill as its president. Beshear said state law {{required}} that the Council conduct a national search for its president and that they <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> with experience and an established reputation in higher education; he claimed that Cowgill, a Lexington lawyer and state budget director for former Governor Fletcher, was not qualified for the position and that the council hired him without a national search. Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway issued a non-binding opinion that the hiring was illegal under state law, and Cowgill resigned rather than wage a legal battle with Beshear. Beshear, who had considered asking all of the council members to resign or abolishing the council altogether {{in favor of a}} new one, praised Cowgill's decision. Democratic House Budget Committee Chairman Harry Moberly said Cowgill [...] "had the council headed in the right direction" [...] and added [...] "I would have been satisfied if Brad had the permanent position, but I do not criticize the governor for the role he had played [...]" [...] Senate President David Williams called Beshear's interference in the matter [...] "unfortunate".|$|E

He {{was a member of}} the Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York.|$|R
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|Production on the anime began {{sometime}} {{after the release}} of the fifth novel in October 2014. [...] Masaharu Watanabe was chosen by Yoshikawa to direct the series because he had previously worked for the studio doing key animation, while Kyuta Sakai was picked to be the series' character designer and animation director because Yoshikawa felt that {{she would be able to}} do justice to the novel's art and also maintain the series animation quality over 25 episodes. [...] Masahiro Yokotani was brought on board to compose the anime, his first time working on a [...] "reborn in another world"-type story. [...] Yoshikawa warned him about the violence in the series, but he was still surprised by the violent and disturbing scenes in novels three and beyond, having only read the first novel when he agreed to work on the project; he delegated the writing of those episodes in the second [...] to the other two scriptwriters. [...] Yoshiko Nakamura joined the project {{sometime after}} Masahiro had completed the script for episode 3. [...] When it proved unfeasible for Yokotani and Nakamura to write the scripts alone, the decision was made to bring another scriptwriter on board. [...] Gaku Iwasa, the president of White Fox, asked them to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "younger", leading Yokotani to suggest Eiji Umehara. [...] Nagatsuki had recently been playing Chaos;Child, which Umehara had written for, and he approved the choice, suggesting that they let Umehara write the [...] "painful parts"; Umehara was invited to join the project around the time that the scripts for episodes 8 and 9 were being written. [...] Re:Zero was the first light novel adaptation that either of the screenwriters had worked on.|$|E

Gansler said the law regulated speech in public without being narrowly designed to increase public safety and traffic flow. Katz said he would find other ways to regulate day laborers.|$|R
2500|$|The studio {{brought in}} screenwriter W. D. Richter, a veteran script doctor (and {{director}} of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) to extensively rewrite the script, {{as he felt}} that the Wild West and fantasy elements didn’t work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story. Richter realized that [...] "what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on". Richter used Rosemary's Baby as his template, presenting [...] "the foreground story in a familiar context [...] rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately [...] and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience". He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks. Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, [...] "I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down {{is not going to get}} you the job. They'll just <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> else".|$|E
2500|$|Paulus {{claimed to}} {{know nothing of}} McKittrick's past, but Bennett thought her {{comparison}} of the two women's lifestyles was unusual if she was telling the truth. He knew that several years earlier she had been arrested on vagrancy and prostitution charges, and he sought a way to impeach her testimony. An officer who had arrested her, Lieutenant Allbright, then testified, casting doubt on her credibility, after which Bennett eventually persuaded Paulus's daughter, Mary Jo Wood, to give evidence against her. The relationship between mother and daughter had soured some years previously, after Paulus had disapproved of a man Wood was dating, attempted to have them both killed, then had her daughter confined to a mental hospital. Wood had escaped from the institution and fled with the man to another state, where the couple married, and {{she was afraid to}} return to Texas. She agreed to testify only after Bennett assured her that the District Attorney's office would ensure her protection while she was in Houston. Bennett introduced Mary Jo Wood as a surprise witness. She went on to testify that when Wood was a young girl, Paulus had owned several properties on Galveston's Post Office Street, a notorious red-light district, that were operated as brothels. She also said that Paulus had accepted payment from a man who wished to perform a sexual act with Wood. Wood testified that she and her mother met Joan Robinson Hill through Diane Settegast around 1963. While at Robinson Hill's home, the women also met Ash Robinson. Wood said that she and her mother occasionally sat in the Robinson box at horse shows. [...] When Wood visited her mother in December 1970, she claimed she was told by Paulus of a call from Settegast, saying that Robinson wanted to <b>hire</b> <b>someone</b> to kill John Hill.|$|E
