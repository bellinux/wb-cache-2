This {{study examines}} {{the factors that}} guide the behaviour and relationships between <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> and intermediary dyads. We examine {{both sides of a}} dyadic transaction and develop an export producer–intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer–intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships...|$|R

In our empirical analysis of the determinants of <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> of software services and of the total <b>Indian</b> goods <b>exports,</b> we raise the following questions: How (dis) similar is {{the performance of the}} <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> of software from the determinants of India's total exports of goods? Are such differences significant? Is the pattern of the performance of the determinants stable over time? Our findings concerning the effects of size, distance, linguistic connections, and trade-facilitating networks enable us to make some important inferences of policy relevance. © 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> over the past thirty years. This study builds on previous research conducted on the demand and supply factors influencing India’s export behavior and builds an imperfect-substitutes demand-supply simultaneous equation model of export determination. However, this paper {{is more than just}} an empirical study of the factors affecting India’s exports. It has broader theoretical implications for the Indian economy including measures to bridge India’s widening trade deficit. The broad findings of this paper are that the supply of India’s exports is price elastic. This suggests that the government should consider pursuing an export-oriented exchange rate policy while striving to maintain low and stable inflation. World demand for <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> is also found to play a significant role, suggesting that the government should focus on expanding and deepening ties with fast growing markets to ensure that demand for <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> continues to remain buoyant. Finally, the government must focus on diversifying India’s export basket away from commodities such as agricultural products, textiles and clothing towards commodities such as chemicals, fuel and mining products. India has a significant share of world exports in the former, but they account for a declining share of aggregate world exports making diversification imperative...|$|R

40|$|India and China are two rapidly {{emerging}} {{economies in}} the world. With their high growth rates and huge markets, these two Asian giants have {{attracted the attention of}} international business mangers to take a fresh look at the rapidly emerging opportunities in the two countries. Today, India–China relations are conspicuous by the fast rise of their merchandise trade, which has already crossed US $ 42 billion in 2009 – 2010. China has already become India’s second largest trade partner only after UAE. Besides this, China has also {{become one of the most}} favourite destinations for Indian exporters. China’s share in India’s global exports has increased rapidly from just 0. 10 per cent in 1990 – 1991 to 6. 47 per cent in 2009 – 2010. However, this growth of <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> to China has not been equally distributed over various commodity groups. In fact, <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> to China are mainly dominated by natural resource-based raw materials or semi-manufactured products which are not considered to be healthy from the Indian point of view. Hence, there is an urgent need to add some technologically advanced products in the export basket to China. According to the need of the time, the present study examines the various trends that occurred in growth and structure of <b>Indian</b> <b>exports</b> to China during the last two decades...|$|R
