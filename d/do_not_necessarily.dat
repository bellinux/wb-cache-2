That is, creativity alone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> produce innovation, and innovation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> depend on creativity. Innovation flows from the systems that direct and discipline creativity towards defined practical goals. Another theme in this book is that individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> innovate in isolation-they collaborate and draw upon externally generated resources.

5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E

The Lodges are usually supervised and governed {{at the regional}} level (usually coterminous with either a state, province, or national border) by a Grand Lodge or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> recognise each other as being legitimate.|$|E

5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E
5|$|Warning signals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> {{require that}} a species {{actually}} possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics {{such as the}} nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common {{approach}} in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in the Midwest and East. These terms <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> translate to others. Individual platforms {{such as the}} Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Slavonia, as a geographical region, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> {{coincide with the}} borders of the five counties, except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them. The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both definitions of the region. In the north, the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a geographic region, but this excludes Baranya from the geographic region's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia. The western boundary of the geographic region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined through history depending on the political divisions of Croatia. The eastern Croatia, as a geographic term, largely overlaps most definitions of Slavonia. It is defined as the territory of the Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, including Baranya.|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} of Unas' reign is uncertain. As indicated above, historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 {{years on the}} throne, figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists, including Flinders Petrie, William C. Hayes, Darrell Baker, Peter Munro, and Jaromir Malek. In favor of such a long reign are scenes of a Sed festival found in Unas' mortuary temple. This festival was normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign and was meant to rejuvenate the pharaoh's strength and power. Mere depictions of the festival <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> imply a long reign; however, for example, a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival {{has been found in}} his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 million {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E
