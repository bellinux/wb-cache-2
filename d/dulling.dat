5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple <b>dulling</b> of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{allegations}} of doping in the Tour de France since the race began in 1903. Early Tour riders consumed alcohol and used ether, among other substances, {{as a means}} of <b>dulling</b> the pain of competing in endurance cycling. Riders began using substances {{as a means of}} increasing performance rather than <b>dulling</b> the senses, and organizing bodies such as the Tour and the International Cycling Union (UCI), as well as government bodies, enacted policies to combat the practice.|$|E

60|$|The Professor was <b>dull,</b> because, {{having to}} leave, {{this was to}} be his last excursion; Captain Wopper was <b>dull,</b> because his {{cherished}} matrimonial hopes were being gradually dissipated. He could not perceive that Lawrence was falling in love with Emma, or Emma with Lawrence. The utmost exertion of sly diplomacy of which he was capable, short of straightforward advice, had failed to accomplish anything towards the desirable end. Emma was <b>dull,</b> because her friend Nita, although recovering, was still far from well. Slingsby was <b>dull</b> for the same reason, and also because he felt his passion to be hopeless. Lewis was <b>dull</b> because he knew Nita's circumstances to be so very sad; and Lawrence was <b>dull</b> because--well, we are not quite sure why he was <b>dull.</b> He was rather a self-contained fellow, and couldn't be easily understood. Of the whole party, Antoine alone was not <b>dull.</b> Nothing could put him in that condition, but, seeing that the others were so, he was grave, quiet attentive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dull</b> was {{originally}} called McKee, {{and under the}} latter name was laid out in 1879 by J. M. <b>Dull</b> and others. A post office was established under the name <b>Dull</b> in 1880, and remained in operation until 1909.|$|R
25|$|Another factor often implicated is to {{the side}} effects of {{antipsychotic}} medications. Atypical antipsychotics may work against smoking cessation, as symptoms of smoking cessation such as irritable mood, mental <b>dulling,</b> and increased appetite overlap with side effects of atypical antipsychotics. Some also argue that smoking works to reduce {{the side effects of}} antipsychotics. However, research shows no association between smoking and antipsychotic use after controlling for schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|De Boer's {{research}} {{caused him}} to speculate ethylene as a gas known to possess this sweet odor. Toxicologist Henry R. Spiller specified that inhalation of even {{a small amount of}} ethylene can cause both benign trances and euphoric psychedelic experiences. Other effects include physical detachment, loss of inhibitions, the relieving of pain, and rapidly changing moods without <b>dulling</b> consciousness. He also noted that excessive doses can cause confusion, agitation, delirium, and loss of muscle coordination.|$|E
25|$|Lehmann {{had only}} limited {{opportunities}} {{at the international}} level. His body shape, relative lack of fitness and physical condition, while never <b>dulling</b> his run-scoring capabilities, meant he was never a favourite of the Australian hierarchy, and notably never saw eye-to-eye with former coach Bob Simpson in the early-mid-1990s. Simpson was {{regarded as one of}} the best fielders to have played the game, and was renowned for his heavy emphasis on fielding and fitness, the weakest aspects of Lehmann's game.|$|E

25|$|High-alcohol liquor, {{two forms}} of which {{were found in the}} US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by {{physicians}} well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for <b>dulling</b> pain, due to the CNS depressant effects of ethyl alcohol, a notable example being the American Civil War. However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or <b>dulling</b> of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Liverpool won the FA Cup {{again but}} Barnes missed the final with an Achilles tendon injury, which he later cited in his {{autobiography}} as <b>dulling</b> his acceleration, affecting his ability to push off from a still position, while not affecting his pace at full. He played just 12 league games in the 1991–92, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league – their lowest finish in two decades {{and the first time}} since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Barnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly, and many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training. Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match. Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said {{in his autobiography}} that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had a lot to offer and was {{still one of the most}} talented players at the club.|$|E

500|$|After {{arriving}} {{at his new}} professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote {{a series of articles}} generally supportive of Marxism. He was not a strong proponent of labor unions or the Communist Party, but he felt that Marx's scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States. Marx's atheism also struck a chord with Du Bois, who routinely criticized black churches for <b>dulling</b> blacks' sensitivity to racism. In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that [...] "olored labor has no common ground with white labor", a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois's dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades.Lewis, p. 551. Du Bois did not support the Communist Party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the 1932 presidential election, in spite of an African American on their ticket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the {{language}} in Hazarajat has been an issue of debate. In the 16th century, when Babur came to Afghanistan, some Hazara spoke Mongolian language, writers like Bacon and Schumann believed the original language of Hazara people was Persian. According to <b>Dulling,</b> on the other hand, the Hazaras' language {{was a mixture of}} Persian and Hindi, in which Persian took over Hindi in Middle Ages. In the late 19th century, Hazaragi, a distinct Persian dialect, began to emerge among the people of Hazarajat. It remains uncertain when Mongolian died out as a living language. <b>Dulling</b> writes, [...] "they ceased to be Mongol speakers {{by the end of the}} 18th century at the latest, and were then speaking Tajik of a sort". Dari is the official language in Hazarajat.|$|E

2500|$|A study {{comparing}} healthy {{individuals to}} people with dysthymia indicates there are other biological indicators of the disorder. [...] An anticipated result appeared as healthy individuals expected fewer negative adjectives to apply to them, whereas people with dysthymia expected fewer positive adjectives to apply {{to them in the}} future. [...] Biologically these groups are also differentiated in that healthy individuals showed greater neurological anticipation for all types of events (positive, neutral, or negative) than those with dysthymia. [...] This provides neurological evidence of the <b>dulling</b> of emotion that individuals with dysthymia have learned to use to protect themselves from overly strong negative feelings, compared to healthy people.|$|E
2500|$|The Arabic word qahwah {{originally}} {{referred to}} a type of wine, whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahā ( [...] , [...] "to lack hunger") {{in reference to the}} drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant. The word qahwah is sometimes alternatively traced to the Arabic quwwa ("power, energy"), or to Kaffa, a medieval kingdom in Ethiopia whence the plant was exported to Arabia. These etymologies for qahwah have all been disputed, however. [...] The name qahwah is not used for the berry or plant (the products of the region), which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Oromo as būn. [...] Semitic had a root qhh [...] "dark color", which became a natural designation for the beverage. [...] According to this analysis, the feminine form qahwah (also meaning [...] "dark in color, <b>dull(ing),</b> dry, sour") was likely chosen to parallel the feminine khamr ( [...] , [...] "wine"), and originally meant [...] "the dark one".|$|E
