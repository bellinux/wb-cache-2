50|$|Clark {{discussed}} the oath and the affidavit separately. In three sentences, Clark held that since past actions and beliefs may impugn present <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty,</b> the affidavit was justified. The {{question for the}} oath (which reached back five years into the past) was its constitutionality, and here Clark relied heavily on United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), to answer that the oath was valid. Since the charter change had occurred seven years before, and the oath reached back only five years, the oath was also not a bill of attainder or ex post facto law. Clark distinguished United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), which was not a general law establishing qualifications for office but which specifically named certain individuals and required their separation from government service.|$|E

60|$|The Indian {{nodded his}} head, {{and made a}} sign for us to follow. Little persuasion was necessary, and we {{proceeded}} at his heels, in a body, in the direction he led. I will confess, that when I saw our guide proceeding eastward, along the lake-shore, I had some misgivings {{on the subject of}} his good faith. That was the direction which took us towards, instead of from the enemy; and there was something so mysterious in the conduct of this man, that it gave me uneasiness. Here he was, {{in the midst of the}} English army in the height of its confusion, though he had declined joining it previously to the battle. Nothing was easier than to enter the throng, in its present confused state, and move about undetected for hours, if one had the nerve necessary for the service; and, in that property, I felt certain the Onondago was not deficient. There was a coolness in the manner of the man, a quiet observation, both blended with the seeming apathy of a red-skin, that gave every assurance of his <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the <b>duty.</b>|$|R
60|$|The inquiry {{before us}} is twofold. Throughout the first volume, I {{carefully}} kept {{the study of}} expression distinct from that of abstract architectural perfection; telling the reader that in every building we should afterwards examine, he would have first to form a judgment of its construction and decorative merit, considering it merely {{as a work of}} art; and then to examine farther, in what degree it fulfilled its expressional purposes. Accordingly, we have first to judge of St. Mark's merely as a piece of architecture, not as a church; secondly, to estimate its <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> its special <b>duty</b> as a place of worship, and the relation in which it stands, as such, to those northern cathedrals that still retain so much of the power over the human heart, which the Byzantine domes appear to have lost for ever.|$|R
50|$|Another common {{practice}} domain for military psychologists is in performing <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> evaluations, especially in high risk and high reliability occupations. The set of unique challenges often faced {{by those in}} the military and the professions of arms such as: police, strategic security, and protective services personnel, the ability to perform reliable and accurate <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> evaluations adds value and maximizes the human capital investment in the workplace by optimizing retention of the talents of active and prospective service men and women while minimizing risk in many areas including violence, mishap, and injury potential. The types of fitness evaluations include both basic entry examinations and career progression examinations such as those conducted when individuals are seeking promotion, higher-classification clearance status, and specialized, hazardous, and mission critical working conditions. When operational commanders become concerned about the impact of continuous, critical, and traumatic operations on those in their command, they often consult with a military psychologist. Military psychologists can assess, diagnose, treat and recommend the duty status most suitable for the optimal well-being of the individual, group, and organization. Events that affect the mental state, resilience or psychological assets and vulnerabilities of the warrior and the command are where military psychologists are most equipped to meet the unique challenges and provide expert care and consultation to preserve the behavioral health of the fighting force. The fitness evaluations might lead to command directed administrative actions or provide the information necessary to make decisions by a medical board or other tribunal and must be thoroughly conducted by non-biased individuals with the experience and training necessary to render a professional opinion that is critical to key decision makers. Military psychologists must be well versed in the art and science of psychology as specialized applied practice professionals. They must also be highly competent generalists in the military profession, and be able to understand both professions well enough to examine human behavior in the context of military operations. It takes the psychologist several years beyond the doctorate to develop the expertise necessary to understand how to integrate psychology with the complex needs of the military.|$|E
5000|$|On March 13, 2014, an {{advisory}} panel {{organized by the}} Palm Center, a research institute based at San Francisco State University, released a report that found no compelling medical reason for placing limitations on military service by transgender individuals.

It said the DoD's policies could be changed by an executive order. The panel was headed by former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and Rear Adm. Alan Steinman, a former chief health and safety director for the Coast Guard. It concluded: We determined not only {{that there is no}} compelling medical reason for the ban, but also that the ban itself is an expensive, damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active, Guard and reserve components.

When several hours had elapsed, however, without producing any sign or sound of game, they began to feel disappointment, and to regard their guide as an exaggerator if not worse; and when, in course of time, the underwood became more dense and their passage through the forest more difficult, they began to make slighting remarks about their dark-skinned friend, and to question his <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the <b>duties</b> of guide.

60|$|In {{the first}} or {{sympathetic}} operation of the theoretic faculty, it will be remembered, we receive pleasure from the signs of mere happiness in living things. In the second theoretic operation of comparing and judging, we constituted ourselves such judges of the lower creatures as Adam was made by God when they were brought to him to be named, and we allowed of beauty in them as they reached, more or less, to that standard of moral perfection by which we test ourselves. But, in the third place, we are to come down again from the judgment seat, and taking {{it for granted that}} every creature of God is in some way good, and has a duty and specific operation providentially accessory to the well-being of all, we are to look in this faith to that employment and nature of each, and to derive pleasure from their entire perfection and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the <b>duty</b> they have to do, and in their entire fulfilment of it: and so we are to take pleasure and find beauty in the magnificent binding together of the jaws of the ichthyosaurus for catching and holding, and in the adaptation of the lion for springing, and of the locust for destroying, and of the lark for singing, and in every creature for the doing of that which God has made it to do. Which faithful pleasure in the perception of the perfect operation of lower creatures I have placed last among the perfections of the theoretic faculty concerning them, because it is commonly last acquired, both owing to the humbleness and trustfulness of heart which it demands, and because it implies a knowledge of the habits and structure of every creature, such as we can but imperfectly possess.|$|R
40|$|Assessing <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> (FFD) {{typically}} requires expensive {{equipment and}} large time windows. Here we capitalize on {{basic principles of}} human time perception to build a portable software package that can quickly and efficiently test for excessive fatigue or traumatic brain injury. Time perception involves a collaboration of many brain areas, and we hypothesize that generalized damage to the brain can be rapidly assessed by subtle disorders in simple timing tasks. We aim to produce an inexpensive, portable device for rapid detection of fatigue or brain injury both in the clinic and on the field. Medical residents, pilots, soldiers, truck drivers, and others frequently work long shifts, which leads to sleep deprivation. Excessive sleep deprivation leads to poor decision-making, which in turn may result in avoidable accidents (Rigaud & Flynn, 1995). Currently, the main method for assessing <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> (FFD) is to measure brain activity using electroencephalography (Caldwell, Prazinko, & Caldwell, 2003).

40|$|In {{keeping with}} the spirit of the new "duty of care " mine safety {{legislation}} passed by the Queensland Parliament on 1 September 1999, it is important that mines manage their own health and safety issues without unnecessary external control and regulation.

40|$|Forensic psychologists and/or psychiatrists {{are often}} asked to perform “fitness for duty ” {{assessments}} by large private corporations, large federal agencies, universities, hospital and other healthcare agencies, {{as well as}} state licensure bureaus (e. g., medicine, nursing, and teachers). The goal of such evaluations is to ascertain to what extent an employee is, or is not, able to meet job expectations. The circumstances leading to referrals are varied. <b>Fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> assessments often are triggered by specific corporate policies that allow or even mandate the evaluation under certain circumstances. For instance, an employee may be accused of breaking a corporate policy concerning workplace violence or harassment, or {{he or she may}} evidence a decrement in work performance caused by psychological impairment and/or substance abuse. Another example would be if an employee works in a job involving safety of products and/or other co-workers and is not meeting job expectations due to cognitive or psychological problems. Because <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> evaluations do not originate from the more typical referral source for forensic psychologists (i. e., courts), this article highlights some of the unique and additional practical, ethical, and legal considerations in <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>duty</b> evaluations. Before agreeing to conduct the evaluation, clinicians should know in detail what the circumstances of the referral are, and specific expectations of the consultation are of particular importance before formally starting the assessment.
