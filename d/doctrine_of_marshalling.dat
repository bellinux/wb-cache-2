40|$|Where {{a senior}} {{creditor}} {{has access to}} two funds from the same debtor to satisfy its claims and the junior creditor has access to {{only one of these}} funds, it could be equitable to expect that the senior creditor satisfy itself out of the fund in which the junior creditor does not have an interest. Where a court makes an order based on this principle, it has invoked the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshalling,</b> sometimes called the two-fund rule. 2 ̆ 7 Marshalling is an equitable doctrine and therein lies its strengths and weaknesses. Equity gives it its flexibility, adaptibility and utility. Equity also gives it its uncertainty and lack of clear boundaries. Marshalling is used to prevent the arbitrary action of a senior creditor from destroying the rights or expectations of a junior creditor or a creditor with less security. It is used to lessen the chance that a junior creditor may lose its security solely at the whim of the senior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s choice of property to pursue. Marshalling is not based on the law of contracts or liens. It is founded instead in equity, being designed to promote fair dealing and justice. Equity has its limits. Use of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshalling</b> is common in several different areas of the law. It is frequently used in the administration of estates to help determine the distribution of assets. This is usually called marshalling of assets and is to be distinguished from its use in settling priorities between successive encumbrancers, called marshalling of securities. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Extract: This text is a {{study of}} the tumultuous {{doctrine}} of subrogation. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshalling</b> of securities, which is based on subrogation, will be treated in a separate text. Chapter 1 emphasises the distinction between subrogation and assignment. Chapter 2 examines the right of subrogation to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of indemnity. The importance, in practice, of the distinc¬ tion between the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of exoneration and the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s right of reimbursement is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 addresses the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation. It examines the discrete situations where the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right of subrogation is enlivened. Chapter 4 deals with those situations where the right of subrogation vests in a person (other than a surety) who discharges a third party 2 ̆ 7 s debt to a secured creditor. It also examines the right of subrogation of a surety who discharges the principal debtor 2 ̆ 7 s debt to the secured creditor. Chapter 5 examines the right of subrogation of a putative lender who purports to lend money to an ultra vires borrower who then uses the proceeds of the putative loan to discharge its intra vires debts. Chapter 6 discusses those situations where a third party payer does not have any right to be subrogated to the (former) right of the payee against the debtor...|$|E

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John. Therefore it is necessary to study the terms which mean sin or describe certain aspects of sin in order to discern John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole...|$|R
