40|$|This {{report is}} the {{conclusion}} of a series of experiments, which were performed on weirs placed obliquely in a shallow flow. Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behaviour and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighbourhood of the weir, hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Two different types of <b>impermeable</b> <b>weirs</b> are tested, including a rectangular sharp-crested weir and a rectangular broad-crested weir, both placed 450 obliquely to the flow direction. These weirs are schematically designed with vertical upstream and downstream walls, sharp edges, and two small end parts of each weir perpendicular to the flow. Flow velocities were measured using Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique, which helps gaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. In conjunction with Matlab we can get almost necessary statistical information. By changing the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow behaviour and various phenomena like vortex, hydraulic jump, undulation, flow divergence, flow concentration, etc. can be observed. The data collected from measurements are used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. This report also aims at a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient. It is shown that the flow tends to change its direction to perpendicular direction with the weir crest. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at {{on one side of the}} flume behind weir, the variation in flow velocity distribution. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which make it difficult to perform accurate measurements. This flow regime also accounts for the higher head loss and energy dissipation than in case of submerged flow condition. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Loss of wetland extent {{continues}} to be documented as a significant problem and {{this is true for}} the headwaters of the Sand River system in the north-east of South Africa. Here wetlands are undergoing severe down-cutting by erosion gullies (don-gas) leading to desiccation of the system and loss of viable substrate that is used for subsistence agriculture. The Manalana sub-catchment was the focus of an integrated wetland rehabilitation programme between 2004 - 2009, a major focus of which was the stabilisation of such erosion gullies by large retaining structures. This paper presents findings of a hydrological monitoring study of the shallow groundwaters to determine the wetland’s hydrodynamic behaviour {{and the extent to which}} this had degraded as a result of erosion. Furthermore, whether technical rehabilitation could ameliorate any degradation in the wetland’s hydrological condition was also assessed. The findings show that the wetland groundwater hydrology is strongly controlled by the distribution of clays within it, facilitating distinct hydrological micro-regions within the wetland spatially and vertically. Based on these findings it is revealed that the loss of these clays impacts severely on the system’s hydrology. The installation of an <b>impermeable</b> buttress <b>weir</b> was able to restore these hydrodynamics as observed through the reversal of the hydraulic gradients between groundwater observation stations, but the precise placement of the structure was shown to be crucial for this effect. This finding demonstrated the requirement of informed, or wise, technical rehabili...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the {{conclusion}} of a comprehensive set of experiments, which were performed on weirs placed obliquely in an open channel. Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behavior and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighborhood of the weir, and hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. The report also aims at presenting a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient for oblique weirs. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Three different types of <b>impermeable</b> <b>weirs</b> are tested, namely a rectangular sharp-crested weir, a rectangular broad-crested weir (both placed 45 degrees obliquely to the flow direction) and a dike-form weir with both upstream and downstream slopes of 1 : 4. The last type was tested with several oblique angles of 0, 45 and 60 degrees with the incident flow. By adjusting the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow regimes and states reveal the complex three dimensional structure of the flow with various phenomena like hydraulic jump, undulation, flow concentration, flow divergence, gyre formation, etc. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which {{make it more difficult to}} perform accurate measurements. This flow regime also accounts for the higher head loss and energy dissipation than in case of submerged flow. Generally speaking, the hydraulic phenomena that happen in the neighborhood of an oblique weir are equivalent for different weir form, although there are some remarkable differences such as the size of the recirculation zone behind weir, and the amplitude of the undulation waves. Experimental data were obtained by many instruments and techniques; most of them had been carefully calibrated and were highly accurate and reliable. The data collected from acoustic and electro-magnetic single point velocimeters and depth measurements were used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. Meanwhile the whole surface flow velocity field was measured using particle tracking velocimetry technique, which helps obtaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. Combine with mathematic tools we can interpret the data and gain necessary statistical information. When the oblique angle of the weir is altered, both the flow direction and the flow rate change. The flow always tends to keep its direction to nearly perpendicular to the weir crest when it reaches and passes the weir. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at on one side of the flume behind weir, the variation in flow velocity distribution and other asymmetries across the flow. Increasing the oblique angle, the effective length of the weir increases significantly, whereas the discharge coefficient Cd slightly decreases. Together they make the discharge capacity of the oblique weir increases. Finally, the discharge coefficient and its relations to other flow and geometry parameters obtained from this research were compared to the available knowledge on oblique weirs, including the published researches from De Vries (1959), Borghei et al. (2003) and the numerical models simulations from Wols (2005). The common findings between researches enhanced each other reliability; whereas the differences are a motivation for further studies.
