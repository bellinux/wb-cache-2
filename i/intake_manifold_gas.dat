This problem is of importance for NOx emissions reduction. The proposed strategy coordinates existing low-level <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> burned <b>gas</b> rate and VVA controllers. To determine relevant control actions, a model of cylinder filling phenomenon is determined. It expresses, under {{the form of a}} discrete event dynamics, the behavior of the cylinder burned gas rate at intake valve closure. Interestingly, the model is invertible, thanks to its analytical nature. This property directly suggests an inverse formula that serves as control law. The strategy is efficient as is highlighted by experimental results obtained on a 1. 6 L Diesel engine test bench. As a result, NOx emissions are largely diminished during transients...|$|R
50|$|Early {{intake valve}} openingEarly intake valve opening is another {{variation}} that has significant potential to reduce emissions. In a traditional engine, {{a process called}} valve overlap is used to aid in controlling the cylinder temperature. By opening the intake valve early, some of the inert/combusted exhaust gas will back flow out of the cylinder, via the intake valve, where it cools momentarily in the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> This inert <b>gas</b> then fills the cylinder in the subsequent intake stroke, which aids in controlling {{the temperature of the}} cylinder and nitric oxide emissions. It also improves volumetric efficiency, because there is less exhaust gas to be expelled on the exhaust stroke.|$|R

Expensive after-treatment technologies to fulfil normative legislations about the harmful tail-pipe emissions and fuel price increase in recent years created expectations from researchers for alternative fuel applications on diesel engines. This study investigates hydrogen as additive fuel in diesel engines. Hydrogen was introduced into <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> using <b>gas</b> injectors as additive fuel in gaseous form and also diesel fuel was injected into cylinder by diesel injector and used as igniter. Energy content of introduced hydrogen was set to 0 %, 25 % and 50 % of total fuel energy, where the 0 % references neat diesel operation without hydrogen injection. Test conditions were set to full load at 750, 900, 1100, 1400, 1750 and finally 2100 [*]r/min engine speed. Variation in engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics with hydrogen addition was investigated. Hydrogen introduction into the engine by 25 % and 50 % of total charge energy reveals significant decrease in smoke emissions while dramatic increase in nitrogen oxides. With increasing hydrogen content, a slight rise is observed in total unburned hydrocarbons although CO 2 and CO gaseous emissions reduced considerably. Maximum in-cylinder gas pressure and rate of heat release peak values raised with hydrogen fraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an internal combustion engine (ICE) requires the application of advanced analysis and tools, where numerical prediction by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code can be utilised in order to perform in-depth investigation into complex engine behaviour. The important source of air pollution from the combustion process of ICE are carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), which needed to be analysed to reduce the engine emission. Hence, this paper presents numerical simulation of concentrations of exhaust emission produced during the combustion process for in the compressed natural gas-direct injection (CNG-DI) engine. The types of emission {{in this study were}} limited to only CO and nitric oxide (NO) as the most dangerous emission pollutant produced by such engine. The CO and NO concentrations are computed using the dissociation of carbon dioxide and three extended Zeldovich mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is {{a crucial}} part in an engine {{that acts as a}} medium for air flow to mix with the fuel before {{entering}} the combustion chamber. For years, cast iron and aluminium were the primary materials chosen for fabrication of an <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> before plastic based material was introduced to the field. However, there is lack of research involving the usage of plastic as the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> material. In this paper, the effects of internal surface roughness variations (Cast iron, aluminium and plastic) inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> were studied. Three dimensional, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> model was developed to simulate the airflow. The study emphasized on the airflow velocity inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The study showed that the surface roughness influenced the air flow velocity near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet. The plastic based <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> exhibited the highest air stream velocity (near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet) at 477. 770 m/s.

Variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is one of the methods in optimizing the performance of an engine. Some of manufacture have great interest on this system such as Volkswagen and Volvo companies. Further research was held by those companies. Each of them has different in design in order to race in technology of engine optimizing. This experiment was conducted by using flow bench that test on the flow rate of the new design <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that has been fabricated. The test is on the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that is used by the 1600 cc engine. Two <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds</b> were tested in this experiment, the Proton Waja <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and the custom <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> that has been fabricated. The result found that the length of runner does affect the flow rate that produced by the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The long runner will give better flow rate on the earlier phase of engine speed while the shorter runner will give better flow rate on the top end of engine speed. That is the reason why the variable <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is better <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> compared to the standard <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> because it can be switch for the suitable length of runner depends on the engine speed condition...|$|R

The {{applicability}} and authenticity of the model is ensured due to the actual shape of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The internal flow field of the manifold is analyzed by combining CAD, CATIA, and CFD software with FLUENT; in addition, the equation is established on the air flow in the manifold and used in the SIMPLE algorithm. The calculation speed is accelerated through combining GAMBIT and FLUENT software, dividing the internal flow field of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> and setting the boundary conditions. The {{results show that the}} optimized flow field is reasonable, the air flow is higher, and the pressure is reduced to varying degrees in the manifold, which effectively reduces the intake resistance and helps to increase the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> especially in the main optimization position by comparing the internal flow field of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and the optimized <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
