50|$|The amidicity {{scale is}} a {{computational}} method for calculating {{the strength of}} an amide bond in an organic compound on a linear scale. It is analogous to aromaticity.

If an amidicity value is close to 100%, then the compound has very good amidic character (and is perfect at 100%); if the value is close to, or below, 0%, then the compound has a lack of amidic character. The scale is not restricted to these values; compounds with weaker amide bonds than azaadamantane-2-one will have amidicities below 0%, whilst compounds with stronger amide bonds than <b>dimethylacetamide</b> will have amidicities of above 100%. If the amidicity value is altered during an acylation, then this will act as a key thermodynamic component of the reaction.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the usual}} nomenclature, one adds the term [...] "amide" [...] to {{the stem of}} the parent acid's name. For instance, the amide derived from acetic acid is named {{acetamide}} (CH3CONH2). IUPAC recommends ethanamide, but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from dimethylamine and acetic acid is N,N-dimethylacetamide (CH3CONMe2, where Me = CH3). Usually even this name is simplified to <b>dimethylacetamide.</b> Cyclic amides are called lactams; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides. Functional groups consisting of -P(O)NR2 and -SO2NR2 are phosphonamides and sulfonamides, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{route to}} polyamide-imides is the condensation of an aromatic diamine, such as methylene dianiline (MDA) and trimellitic acid chloride (TMAC). Reaction of the anhydride with the diamine produces an intermediate amic acid. The acid chloride functionality reacts with the aromatic amine {{to give the}} amide bond and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as a by-product. In the commercial preparation of polyamideimides, the polymerization is carried out in a dipolar, aprotic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), <b>dimethylacetamide</b> (DMAC), dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at temperatures between 20-60 °C. The byproduct HCl must be neutralized in situ or removed by washing it from the precipitated polymer. Further thermal treatment of the polyamideimide polymer increases molecular weight and causes the amic acid groups to form imides with the evolution of water.|$|E
50|$|The non-aqueous Li-air {{batteries}} {{were demonstrated}} first (Abraham and Jiang 1996). They usually {{use the same}} mixed ethylene carbonate+ propylene carbonate solvents with LiPF6 or Li bis-sulfonimide salts like the conventional lithium-ion batteries, however, with a gelled rather than liquid electrolyte. (Imanishi, Matsui, et al. 2014) The voltage difference upon constant current charge and discharge is usually between 1.3 and 1.8 V (with an OCP of ca. 4.2 V) even at such ridiculously low currents as 0.01-0.5 mA/cm² and 50-500 mA/g of C on the positive electrode (see Fig. 2 as an example), (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, McCloskey, Burke, et al. 2015, Liu, Xu, et al. 2016). However, the carbonate solvents do evaporate and get oxidized due to a high overvoltage upon charge, (Lu and Amine 2013) and other solvents, such as end-capped glymes, DMSO, <b>dimethylacetamide,</b> and ionic liquids, have been considered. (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014) Carbon cathode also gets oxidized above +3.5 V v Li during charge forming Li2CO3, which leads to an irreversible capacity loss (Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014).|$|E
50|$|The thermal stability, flame resistance, and {{moisture}} regain of PBI and its conventional textile processing character {{enable it to}} be processed on conventional staple fiber textile equipment. These characteristics lead {{to one of the}} most important applications of PBI: protective apparel. PBI filaments were fabricated into protective clothing like firefighters' gear and astronauts' suits. PBI filaments are dry spun from <b>dimethylacetamide</b> containing lithium chloride. After washing and drying the resulting yarn is golden brown. PBI fiber is an excellent candidate for applications in severe environments due to its combination of thermal, chemical and textile properties. Flame and thermal resistance are the critical properties of protective apparel. This kind of apparel applications includes firefighter’s protective apparel, astronaut’s suits, aluminized crash rescued gear, industrial worker’s apparel, and suits for racing car drivers. The problem of PBI protective apparel is that it keeps heat out but it also keeps the heat in, too. Thus, by the time the firefighters feel heat and pain, it is too late and they will get burnt or killed since it is hard for the heat to penetrate the suit and be released into the air. There are still some major fire departments have not yet switched from old fire gear to PBI due to the fear of what PBI can cause. One example is the Chicago Fire Department, which still relies on the old type of rubber or leather coats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preparation}} of PBI(IV) {{can be achieved}} by condensation reaction of diphenyl isophthalate (I) and 3,3’,4,4’-tetraaminodiphenyl (II) (Figure 1). The spontaneous cyclization of the intermediately formed animo-amide (III) to PBI (IV) provided a much more stable amide linkage.This synthetic method was first used in the lab and later developed into a two step process. In a typical condition, starting materials were heated at 270 degree for 1.5 h to form the PBI prepolymer and later the prepolymer was heated at 360 degree for another 1 h to form the final commercial-grade product. The reason for the second step is due to the formation of the by-product phenol and water in the first step creating voluminous foam, which leads to the volume expansion of several times of the original. This is the issue that must be considered by the industrial manufacturers. This foam can be reduced by conducting the polycondensation at a high temperature around 200 °C and under the pressure of 2.1-4.2 MPa. The foam can also be controlled by adding high boiling point liquids such as diphenylether or cetane to the polycondesation. The boiling point can make the liquid stay in the first stage of polycondesation but evaporate in the second stage of solid condensation. The disadvantage of this method is that there are still some liquids which remain in PBI and it is hard to remove them completely.While changing the tetramine and acid, a number of different aromatic poly benzimidazoles have been synthesized. The following table (Table 1) [...] lists out some of the combination possibilities that have been synthesized in the literature. Some of the combination have actually been translated into fibers on a small scale. However, the only significant progress have been made to date is PBI.The most common form of PBI used in industry is the fiber form. The fiber process following polymerization is shown in the figure. The polymer is made into solution using <b>dimethylacetamide</b> as solvent. The solution is filtered and converted into fiber using a high temperature dry-spinning process. The fiber is subsequently drawn at elevated temperature to get desired mechanical properties. It is then sulfonated and made into staple using conventional crimping and cutting techniques.|$|E
