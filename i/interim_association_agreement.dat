40|$|The European Court of Justice {{declared}} in the Brita {{case that the}} West Bank and Gaza Strip are outside the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Association Agreement. Preferential treatment may only be requested for products from these areas following the rules and procedures contained in the EC-PLO <b>Interim</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement.</b> In this journal, Harpaz and Rubinson {{have argued that the}} ECJ reliance on international law in Brita was "one dimensional, incomplete and selective" and criticised the missing reference to international trade law. This article takes a different point of view. Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, {{at the core of the}} Court's decision, corresponds to the foundation of the current architecture of regional trade agreements. Moreover, when taking a closer look, international trade law and the WTO system have apparently little to add to the interpretation of the rules involved in this case. Those rules were left largely to the discretion of the parties, creating two different trading systems (the regional and the multilateral WTO system) with very complex interactions...|$|E

50|$|A European Union <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> (for short, <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> or AA) is {{a treaty}} between the European Union (EU), its Member States and a non-EU country {{that creates a}} {{framework}} for co-operation between them. Areas frequently covered by such agreements include the development of political, trade, social, cultural and security links. The legal base for {{the conclusion of the}} <b>association</b> <b>agreements</b> is provided by art. 217 TFEU (former art. 310 and art. 238 TEC).|$|R
40|$|<b>Association</b> <b>agreement</b> {{between the}} EU and Georgia, unlike the prior similar agreements, {{takes into account}} very {{important}} mechanisms of real convergence with European Union, European legislation and standards. <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union does not imply affiliation, (ex. Turkey an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed in 1960, but the country is still not an EU member). However, an <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the EU legislation implies such {{a high level of}} convergence that the effective implementation of the Europeanization process is irreversible. In addition, the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union is the real mechanism of political association and gradual economic integration. However, it should be understood that the agreement is contributing to a lot of things, many of which gives rise to liability. For the proper execution of agreement relevant levers like many aspects of Georgian economy, trade policy and legislation, which we will discuss in this paper, are required...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{there is}} also the largely defunct term of {{associate}} member. It has occasionally been applied to states which have signed an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey. Turkey's <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> was the 1963 Ankara Agreement, implying that Turkey became an associate member that year. Present <b>association</b> <b>agreements</b> include the Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> with the western Balkans; these states are no longer termed [...] "associate members".|$|R
50|$|Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are part}} of the EU Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) and European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). At present, the {{countries}} of the Western Balkans are the focus of the SAP. Specific Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (SAA) have been implemented with various Balkan countries which explicitly include provisions for future EU membership of the country involved. SAAs are similar in principle to the Europe Agreements signed with the Central and Eastern European countries in the 1990s and to the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with Turkey.|$|R
