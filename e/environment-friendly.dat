5|$|In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) {{designated}} the entire Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) and assigned {{three levels of}} Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, was a committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats. Gadgil Committee and its successor Kasturirangan Committee recommended suggestions to protect the Western Ghats. Gadgil report was criticized as being too <b>environment-friendly</b> and Kasturirangan report was labelled as being anti-environmental.|$|E
25|$|A monoammoniumphosphate (MAP)-based multi-purpose, dry {{chemical}} ABC powder for extinguishing fires {{has also been}} developed.

25|$|In {{addition}} to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more-productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and crop production (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an <b>environment-friendly</b> way) soils for better crop production, and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{used since}} 1998, iminodisuccinic (IDS) acid biodegrades about 80% after only 7 days. IDS binds to calcium {{exceptionally}} well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions. In {{addition to having}} a lower toxicity after chelation, the production of IDS is <b>environment-friendly.</b> Specifically, IDS is degraded {{through the use of}} IDS-epimerase and C–N lyase found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (BY6) which can be harvested on a large scale. Additionally, the reactions catalyzed by both enzymes do not require any cofactors and can thus be applied directly.|$|E
25|$|Automation was {{incorporated}} into the design of CNB to reduce manpower requirements. It has an automated underground ammunition depot that allows ammunition to be loaded onto the ships and an automated warehouse system to store items. The base has a fibre optic broadband network for information management. The base was also designed to be <b>environment-friendly,</b> with small-scale wind turbines powering the lights along the breakwaters at night. Conventional roof construction materials were substituted by thin film solar panels and the solar energy generated lights the base. In addition, seawater {{is used in the}} air-conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the town the area was covered by temperate coniferous forests (mostly pine and fir) with an admixture of broad-leaved trees and fens. The soils were mostly podzol, combined with peat and gleysols. Intensive economic activities changed the original forest landscape to agricultural land with small groves of aspen, birch, alder and willow. In the 18–19th centuries, a large park area of 704 hectares has been created in and around the city. Owing to the parks and <b>environment-friendly</b> policies, the Pushkin area has relatively low level of pollution. There is a large number of birds, reptiles and invertebrates; also common are hare and muskrat.|$|E
25|$|But K. Radhakrishnan, {{a former}} member (generation), KSEB, has opined that this panel report was highly biased with vested {{interests}} and the project was eco-friendly doing minimum damage to environment and forests. While there are reports from renowned experts from Kerala State Biodiversity Board that the power project would adversely affect {{the ecology of the}} area and the estimated power output would be dependable upon the rainfall and dry summer seasons, which is undependable in its own way. M. Sivasankar, a KSEB chairman and MD states the need of more <b>environment-friendly</b> power projects with lower operating cost and higher output like super critical boiler plants. Cheemeni Power Project which is planned to produce 1500 MW is such a project in the government binders.|$|E

The main objective of the FME-centres is to {{contribute to the development of}} good technologies for environmentally friendly energy and to raise the level of Norwegian expertise in this area. In addition, they should help to generate new industrial activity and new jobs. Over the next eight years, the FME-Centre ZEB will develop competitive products and solutions for existing and new buildings that will lead to market penetration of zero emission buildings related to their production, operation and demolition.|$|E
