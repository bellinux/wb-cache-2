40|$|SIGNIFICANCE: The tobacco {{industry}} argues that tobacco sales {{are important to}} small retailers’ business. We examined 1) tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales, and profits in small shops, 2) differences by area deprivation and smoking prevalence, and 3) the role of e-cigarettes. METHODS: Sales data from 1447 shops covering two 2 -week periods in 2015 (weeks starting 1 June, 8 June, 14 Sept, 21 Sept) recorded by electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) in small shops in the UK were obtained from an EPOS company. Data were aggregated into weekly tobacco, non-tobacco, and e-cigarette sales values, <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales quantities, and transactions. RESULTS: For the week starting 21 Sept (N= 1416), mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products were 6. 6 % (SD= 2. 2) and 24. 1 % (SD= 4. 9) on non-tobacco products. Mean total sales values (tobacco+non-tobacco sales) =£ 14, 893. 58 (SD= 8543. 91) while mean tobacco sales=£ 3, 716. 17 (SD= 2087. 16), thus tobacco accounted for 26. 0 % (SD= 0. 08) of total sales. Mean total gross profits=£ 2, 894. 54 (SD= 1788. 81) while mean gross profits from tobacco were only £ 241. 80 (SD= 165. 41), thus tobacco accounted for 9. 1 % (SD= 0. 05) of total profits. Area smoking prevalence and deprivation were both positively correlated with tobacco sales values and tobacco gross profits, but negatively correlated with tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> (p< 0. 0001 for all). N= 550 shops {{had at least one}} e-cigarette transaction, with a mean of 3. 2 (SD= 5. 3) transactions and mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> of 43. 4 % (SD= 10. 5). Week 4 (N= 1416) was chosen for presentation because it was the most current and had fewer EPOS errors. Findings across the 4 weeks were similar although small differences were found, including tobacco and total sales values (p< 0. 0001). Tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> did not differ (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high sales values, tobacco has low <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> compared to other products. Tobacco sales values are higher in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{explaining}} why the UK residential electricity (retail) market enjoys high <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> {{in comparison to}} Vattenfall’s markets in for example Sweden. <b>Gross</b> <b>margin</b> {{is the difference between}} selling price and purchase costs, in this case the wholesale electricity price. The wholesale market essentially affects all retailers in the same way and can be analysed separately, therefore it is of great interest to analyse how there can be such a wide gap between the end-user electricity price and the wholesale price. Since the UK electricity market is seen as a forerunner to other markets, being an early adopter of liberalisation of a previously state-controlled industry and seen as the most competitive market in the world, it seems a bit odd that retail electricity prices are not pushed down to a margin cost level as is expected on a perfectly competitive market. The report concludes that there are substantially higher <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> <b>on</b> the UK market and then goes on to determine which the underlying drivers to this situation are. There are two underlying socio-cultural factors that have driven the development of the market. First it is the history of deregulation that brought lower end-user prices but also bad service experiences. Secondly, the UK public has a market-friendly mentality and acceptance to how the industry works. The result is that focus has moved away from price and there is little public worry about the market being too concentrated. Two more underlying drivers are related to the properties of the market: the linkage between gas and electricity that has lessened the impact of the electricity price and the UK trading system that makes it hard for new retailers to enter the market and put a pressure downwards <b>on</b> prices and <b>gross</b> <b>margins.</b> These four underlying drivers have created a market situation where price has not been perceived as the only value component of electricity and where the focus <b>on</b> price and <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> has been overshadowed by other issues in the public debate. The troublesome history have produced a ‘demand for brand’ that signals safety, which has helped building substantial barriers of entry and survival for non-incumbents retailers. Together with a highly consolidated market structure, a handful of large retailers are enabled to dominate the market and push up prices with little fear of retribution from competitors or society.

40|$|Economic {{magnitude}} {{of the increase in}} stockouts The empirical analysis in the paper finds that, on average, taking on high leverage increases stockouts by about 8 to 9 percent. To put this magnitude in perspective, I construct an estimate of the profit impact of an 8 percent increase in stockouts for the average supermarket firm. The calculation, which is presented in Panel A of Table A 1, trades off the benefit of reduced inventory investment for the lost profits from forgone current and future sales. The value of reduced inventory investment equals the decrease in inventories times the cost of carrying inventory, which includes storage, utilities, handling, insurance, taxes, obsolescence, and the cost of capital. On the other hand, more frequent stockouts reduce current sales when customers substitute to lowervalue products or cancel their intended purchase of the out-of-stock item. The profit impactof this substitution equals the value of forgone sales (which others have estimated based on surveys of customer substitution patterns) times the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> <b>on</b> these products. More frequent stockouts also have a longer-run impact on sales in that the firm is likely to lose customers when its reputation for service deteriorates.

Fifteen percent of the savings comes from making the purchase at a low-price dealership affiliated with the web service.

Moreover; the relation between <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> and specification of the veterinary practise could be studied. Finally, the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm and the factors that influenced this <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> were studied. The most important result was the observation that the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per bovine practitioner was dependent on the number of dairy farms per practitioner, the <b>margin</b> <b>on</b> drugs and the region of the veterinary practise. The size of the veterinary practise, the share of the dairy farming within the practise and the source of the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> (drugs, time or operations) did not influence the <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> Variables that explained the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm were, amongst others, the number of dairy cows, the milk production level of the farms and participation in PIR-DAP system to support the veterinarians herd health and management program). There is no relation of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per dairy farm and the veterinary practise or region...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Compaq {{acquired}} Digital Equipment Corporation for a then-industry {{record of}} $9 billion USD. The merger made Compaq, at the time, the world's second largest computer maker {{in the world}} in terms of revenue behind IBM. Digital Equipment, which had nearly twice as many employees as Compaq while generating half the revenue, had been a leading computer company during the 1970s and early 1980s. However, Digital had struggled during the 1990s, with high operating costs. For nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even, and had recently refocused itself as a [...] "network solutions company". In 1995, Compaq had considered a bid for Digital but only became seriously interested in 1997 after Digital's major divestments and refocusing on the Internet. At the time of the acquisition, services accounted for 45 percent of Digital's revenues (about $6 billion) and their <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> <b>on</b> services averaged 34 percent, considerably higher than Compaq's 25% <b>margins</b> <b>on</b> PC sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from Compaq for years. Compaq had originally wanted to purchase only Digital's services business but that was turned down. When the announcement was made, it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave Compaq a 22,000 person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases (by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq's revenues, largely due to the Digital employees inherited from the merger), in order to compete with IBM. However it was also risky merger, as the combined company would have to lay off 2,000 employees from Compaq and 15,000 from Digital which would potentially hurt morale. Furthermore, Compaq fell behind schedule in integrating Digital's operations, which also distracted the company from its strength in low-end PCs where it used to lead the market in rolling out next-generation systems which let rival Dell grab market share. Reportedly Compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate Digital alone.|$|R
40|$|Sheep have {{multiple}} {{roles in the}} livelihood of resource poor farmers as source of income, meat, skin, manure, strong wool or long hairy fleece, and as buffer resources during crop failures. These important services and products of the sheep production sub-sector justify comprehensive look into the way sheep are marketed, as the services and products are the quality attributes that characterize sheep as such. Nonetheless, very {{few studies have been}} conducted so far to identify the determinants of indigenous sheep prices and performance of the marketing system. This study will therefore contribute by assessing the performance and by identifying factors that affect the price of indigenous Menz sheep in the markets of Menz District in Ethiopia. Data from primary sources were collected through market and traders' surveys. For market survey five markets (Mollale, Mehal meda, Bash, Geyi and Wejed) were included in the study, in addition to the five markets one terminal market from Addis Ababa (Sholla market) were included for traders survey. Market survey was conducted in three seasons (Holiday, normal and fasting) and a sample of 338 transactions level data were collected from sample markets. Traders’ survey was carried out during two different periods, one during high transaction (festival period) and another during normal period. All traders who attended the market were included in the survey and sample of 186 traders were surveyed. Structure, conduct and performance approach was used to examine sheep marketing efficiency. Concentration ratio was computed to assess the concentration of the market and binary logit model was estimated to analyze market barriers. Marketing costs and margins were computed along with a multiple linear regression model to identify factors that determine <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> Composite index was used as well to judge efficiency of different sheep marketing channels. Hedonic price model was estimated with Heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrices to estimate factors that determine price of sheep. Survey results show that the markets are underdeveloped and inefficient, characterized by lack of xiv marketing facilities and services. The value of concentration ratio indicated that traders operate in an inefficient market. The result of logit model confirm working capital, access to information, education and experience in trading business are significant explanatory variables, which have effect on the existence of market barriers. The result of <b>Gross</b> <b>margin</b> explains that full time traders and secondary farmer traders get high <b>gross</b> marketing <b>margin,</b> the higher <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> indicates inefficiency in the marketing system. In addition, the result of multiple regression showed that variable cost, experience of traders, increased period between purchase and sale transactions and loss of sheep increased unit <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, unit <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> significantly decreased as size of working capital increased besides trader who have access to price information and sale their animal to regular customer earned significantly lower margin than those who did not. The result of hedonic model show that price of sheep is affected by the characteristics of sheep such as sex and age based class of sheep, age, body condition, coat color of sheep and coat hair. Sheep price was also found to be influenced by season, market location, buyers’ purpose and sellers’ purpose. Hence, {{it is important to consider}} the preferred phenotypic attributes of sheep in designing appropriate policies so as to make livestock keepers benefited from increased production and productivity. Besides, improving marketing facilities and services, organizing and supporting marketing cooperatives, and improving marketing infrastructure would create favorable conditions for sheep marketing in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether working capital management affect the performance of non-financial listed firms in Pakistan. Panel econometric technique namely pooled ordinary least squares is used to estimate the relationship between working capital and firm performance. Data were taken from the annual reports of non-financial firms listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange Pakistan during 2007 - 2010. Three performance measures namely <b>gross</b> profit <b>margin,</b> return <b>on</b> asset, and return on equity are used to estimate the impact of working capital variables such as average age of inventory, average collection period, and average payment period. Empirical results indicate that average age of inventory is positively related to <b>gross</b> profit <b>margin</b> and return <b>on</b> asset, whereas it is negatively related to return on equity but the relationship is found insignificant. Although the relationship is insignificant but positive sign may be because of increasing sales which leads to higher profit and thus fewer inventories. Average collection period is significantly and positively related to <b>gross</b> profit <b>margin</b> and return <b>on</b> assets. This finding shows that management of receivables has a positive impact on firm performance. Moreover, it confirms the prediction that reduction in average collection perio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of current market {{conditions}} and Agenda 2000 CAP reforms, particularly the 'rebalancing' of support between cereals and oilseed crops, <b>on</b> crop <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> and hence <b>on</b> the incentive to produce oilseed rape on three representative farm types in eastern England. Results indicate that under a conventional rotation, oilseed rape area falls substantially {{on two of the}} farm types considered. However, the incentive to plant break crops more frequently increases after the reform; under a two-break crop rotation, oilseed rape area remains at pre-reform levels. Oilseed rape prices of c. £ 100 per tonne, particularly when combined with unrestricted set-aside rates, conventional rotations and low cereal prices, would give farmers in eastern England substantial incentives to reduce the area of the crop grown...|$|R
40|$|High-technology {{manufacturing}} companies often face rapid price decline and capacity constraints. Especially {{in the retail}} {{side of the business}} where the supply chain is much longer and revenue is sometimes not recognized until the sell-through point, optimizing inventory positioning is critical. No longer is a one-size-fits-all approach sufficient; in order to perform optimally, manufacturers should categorize their retailers, stores, and products, and tailor their strategy for each accordingly. This work shows how to use metrics such as <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> return <b>on</b> inventory investment, models and tools such as assortment, promotional risk, supply chain, and replenishment segmentation to drive improvements in inventory performance and recommends ways to apply them in different retail chains. In particular, three retailer types - discount retailers, specialty retailers, and convenience retailers are discussed. by Catherine G. Liang. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|We {{study the}} {{restructuring}} activities undertaken during the private period by reverse leveraged buyout (RLBO) firms. Using an exclusive sample, we measure changes in profitability, financial structure, and cost structure to detect restructuring activities during the private period. Approaching the private period, these firms suffer significant deterioration in earnings, while capital expenditures {{decrease in the}} presence of high leverage. Under private ownership, firms experience a significant decline in capital expenditures, retained earnings and liquidity, while leverage increases. We find a decline in cost of goods sold in conjunction with improvements in <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> return <b>on</b> assets and ratio of sales per employee during the private period. However, excessive private period personnel reductions adversely affect post-RLBO performance. Firms that develop new investment opportunities during the private restructuring have a higher probability of long-run survival. We find support for the business media’s advice to avoid the “quick flips. ” Poor performance, stock delistings, and management buyouts are typical of firms with the shortest private periods, while asset growth and post-RLBO success is concentrated in firms with long private periods. Additionally, we identify ex-ante fir...|$|R
