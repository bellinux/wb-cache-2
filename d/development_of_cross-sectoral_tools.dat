Scientific {{research}} collaborations are attracting {{increasing interest}} from both academia and policy {{in terms of}} their potential to contribute to scientific progress. In particular, special attention has been placed on two research collaboration practices: cross-sectoral research collaborations and cross-disciplinary research collaborations. Despite the numerous policy initiatives to stimulate these two modes of scientific research organisation, scientists exhibit dramatic differences in their collaborative patterns to organise research, and in their attitudes to form these types of partnerships. This study takes a Scientific and Technical Human Capital (S&T human capital) approach to examine the influence of two characteristics of research careers that are likely to influence scientists’ engagement in cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaborations. S&T human capital is the sum of skills, knowledge and social relations needed to participate in science (Bozeman & Corley, 2004). A researcher’s S&T human capital is constantly evolving throughout her professional life cycle (Bozeman, 2008). We consider here two career characteristics that are likely to affect this evolution substantially: inter-sectoral job mobility and scientific excellence measured in terms of publication productivity. We examine data from 1593 employed at CSIC - the Spanish National Research Council – who responded to a survey conducted in 2011 covering all fields of science. The resulting dataset includes 285 CSIC researches who declared professional experience in industry, 157 CSIC researchers with previous experience in other non research oriented governmental organisations, and 396 who had professional experience in either of the two former sectors. Additionally, we use respondents’ publication records to distinguish individuals with high publication productivity. We examine the influence of excellence and mobility career backgrounds on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> and cross-disciplinary collaborations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Climate change impacts {{affecting}} coastal areas, such as {{sea-level rise}} and storm surge events, {{are expected to}} have significant social, economic and environmental consequences worldwide. Ongoing population growth and development in highly urbanised coastal areas will exacerbate the predicted impacts on coastal settlements. Improving the adaptation potential of highly vulnerable coastal communities will require greater levels of planning and policy integration across sectors and scales. However, to date, there is little evidence in the literature which demonstrates how climate policy integration is being achieved. This paper contributes to this gap in knowledge by drawing on the example provided by the process <b>of</b> developing <b>cross-sectoral</b> climate change adaptation policies and programmes generated for three coastal settlement types as part of the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQCARI), a 3 -year multi-sectoral study of climate change adaptation options for human settlements in South East Queensland, Australia. In doing so, we first investigate the benefits and challenges to cross-sectoral adaptation to address climate change broadly and in coastal areas. We then describe how cross-sectoral adaptation policies and programmes were generated and appraised involving the sectors of urban planning and management, coastal management, emergency management, human health and physical infrastructure as part of SEQCARI. The paper concludes by discussing key considerations that can inform the <b>development</b> and assessment <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> climate change adaptation policies and programmes in highly urbanised coastal areas.

40|$|Effective {{programmes}} for integrated {{river basin}} management {{are critical for}} the protection and wise use of rivers and other wetland ecosystems. Conversely, considering wetland ecosystems as essential aspects of “water infrastructure” can help to support integrative water resources management programmes, especially in relation to water supply and development objectives. In recognition of the critical role of wetland ecosystems {{in the delivery of}} water and water-related ecosystem services, and the importance of water for maintaining the ecological character of wetlands, Contracting Parties of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands have adopted several significant water-related Resolutions and a range of scientific and technical guidance. The Convention’s water-related guidance is intended to assist policy makers and wetland managers towards developing and implementing practical strategies and solutions to problems and challenges associated with integration of wetlands and water management. on the guidance further promotes best practices in the <b>development</b> and implementation <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> policies and programmes where these depend on or affect wetlands, for example in relation to climate change, food and water security, and poverty reduction. The very real institutional, technical, biophysical and economic challenges related to integrated river basin management must be recognized. However, progress in integrating the needs of wetland ecosystems into land and water resources planning and management at river basin level remains slow: successes tend to be hard-won over very long periods, frequently confined to smaller river basins, and seeming often to need the incentive of threatened or actual collapse of wetland ecosystems in order to stimulate collaborative planning and implementation in response. Case studies suggest that while the range of potential obstacles and challenges to integrating wetlands into river basin management might be limited to a set of fairly common generic themes, locally-developed solutions to overcoming them are varied and creative...|$|R

None of this was assisted by the sources of funding for tertiary education being divided between levels of government. Other obstacles included competition for students, tightly regulated profile negotiation processes in the VET sector and the use of non-graded approaches to competency assessment. Nevertheless, some staff in both the university and VET sectors are working very hard to collaborate and to create opportunities for students to study across sectors.

40|$|The {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> linkages {{is vital}} to ensure economic diversification of an economy where natural resource production dominates.

Examining Norwegian economic diversification in the period 1970 – 1994, this paper concludes that the use of consistent and decisive government policy of building Norwegian industrial competency, implemented through statutes and licensing conditions, has successfully established cross-sectoral linkages built on the principles of economic diversification. Conversely, Australia has left economic diversification to market forces, which has resulted in minimal cross-sectoral linkages, and a decline in the industrial sector. Where government intervention has occurred, such as in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the Australian Marine Complex in Western Australia, successful cross-sectoral linkages have been developed...|$|R

Subsequent support from the welfare, health and justice sectors is sometimes inconsistent, inaccessible or inappropriate to women’s needs. • We argue that the quality and suitability of service provision by domestic and family violence and sexual assault practitioners to women experiencing IPSV would be strengthened by: asking women about the possibility <b>of</b> IPSV; the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> clearer referral protocols; and the promotion <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> information sharing and training. • These developments need to occur within a context of large-scale cultural and systemic change within the justice, health and community service sectors, in terms of attitudes towards and understandings about women’s experiences of IPSV...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{international}} development community, global agreement around a poverty elimination target and the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) {{has led to}} renewed emphasis on partnership and cross-sectoral approaches. Similarly the UK Government aims to ensure policies are coherent in an increasingly complex global arena and has called for joined-up working. In response to both of these influences, the UK Government Department for International Development (DFID) stresses partnership, joining-up and cross-sectoral approaches within departmental documents. This research explores cross-sector policy and practice at DFID in the UK and Nepal and focuses particularly on cross-sectoral relationships between reproductive health and women's education. The research employs a social constructionist epistemology and utilises Critical Inquiry and Feminist theories, elements of grounded theory and narrative analysis methodologies, informing the use of numerous data collection methods. These methods include literature searches, document analysis, semi-structured interviews (incorporating Participatory Learning and Action techniques), informal meetings and critical reflection. Data was gathered in the UK and Nepal from DFID staff, Nepali Government staff, DFID-funded project staff, external development consultants and other stakeholders. A 'cross-sector continuum model' is presented to facilitate understanding of the different definitions and possible levels <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> engagement. Examples <b>of</b> cross-sector policy and practice are presented and discussed. Key factors facilitation cross-sector policy and practice are also identified. The greatest levels <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> engagement were found at project-level in Nepal, although the DFID offices had also made some significant efforts to improve cross-sectoral approaches. Poor knowledge and selective use of the reproductive health and women's education research, however, exposed a gap between research and policy. In addition, the reality of cross-sector policy and practice often did not match the rhetoric within DFID's documents. According to respondents, DFID faces some substantial challenges that contribute to these research-to-policy and policy-to-implementation gaps. Despite the increased calls for cross-sectorality, {{there is little evidence}} of the benefits of cross-sector policy and practice, suggesting the need for research clarifying the added value <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> approaches. Finally, the lack of agreement over cross-sector definitions, the lack of operational guidance and DFID's strong emphasis on outcomes all suggest the need for a reorientation <b>of</b> focus towards <b>cross-sectoral</b> processes. Based on these findings and conclusions, recommendations are made for DFID and other organisations wishing to pursue cross-sectoral approaches.

40|$|This {{pilot study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} and examine an instrument that integrates relevant aspects <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> (in- and outpatients) mental health care, is simply to use and shows satisfactory psychometric properties. The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the scale comprised literature research, held 14 focus groups and 12 interviews with patients and health care providers, item-pool generation, content validation by a scientific expert panel, and face validation by 90 patients. The preliminary scale was tested on 385 patients across seven German hospitals with cross-sectoral mental health care (CSMHC) {{as part of their}} treatment program. Psychometric properties of the scale were evaluated using genuine and transformed data scoring. To check reliability and postdictive validity of the scale, Cronbach’s α coefficient and multivariable linear regression were used. This development process led to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> an 18 -item scale called the “Scale for Evaluation of Psychiatric Integrative and Continuous Care (SEPICC) ” with a two-point and five-point response options. The scale consists of two sections. The first section assesses {{the presence or absence of}} patients’ experiences with various CSMHC’ relevant components such as home treatment, flexibility of treatments’ switching, case management, continuity <b>of</b> care, <b>cross-sectoral</b> therapeutic groups, and multidisciplinary teams. The second section evaluates the patients’ opinions about these relevant components. Using raw and transformed scoring resulted into comparable results. However, data distribution using transformed scoring showed a smaller deviation from normality. For the overall scale, the Cronbach’s α coefficient was 0. 82. Self-reported experiences with relevant components of the CSMHC were positively associated with the patients approval of these components. In conclusion, the new scale provides a good starting point for further validation. It can be used as a tool to evaluate CSMHC. Methodologically, using transformed data scoring appeared to be preferable because of a smaller deviation from normality and a higher reliability measured by Cronbach’s α...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of market-oriented economy in 1986, Vietnam has made noticeable socio-economic progress. In this progress, the energy sector has played a vital role. This role is likely to deepen {{in the years to}} come as Vietnam strives to achieve even higher levels in economic progress. Such deepening in the role of energy, this paper argues, will heighten concerns about the security of energy supply, and economic, environmental, social and political consequences. In order to address these issues, Vietnam has over the last decade, developed a suite of energy policies. A deeper review of these policies suggests that they are typified by economic-growth orientation, exclusive focus on a single-sector or single issue, and largely neglect the significance <b>of</b> <b>cross-sectoral</b> and cross-thematic issues arising from the interdependencies between energy, economy, and the polity at large.
