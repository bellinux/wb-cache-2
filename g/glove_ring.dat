40|$|Neoprene gloves {{are used}} in a Space Shuttle Microgravity Glove Box (MGBX) experiment. In 1999, {{significant}} corrosion was observed in the work area and on the outer surface of the left <b>glove</b> <b>ring.</b> Analysis of the corrosion products showed that they contained chlorine. The Neoprene gloves used in this glove box were obtained in 1995, with a recommended shelf life of 3 years. After storage of these gloves in a cabinet drawer until 1999, significant signs of corrosion were also observed in the drawer. Mechanical and thermal properties were determined on samples cut from the finger and sleeve areas of the "good" and "bad" gloves. This data showed significant aging of the left-hand glove, particularly in the sleeve area. Thermal analysis data by DSC and TGA was complimentary to tensile data in showing this aging. However, this test data did not pinpoint {{the cause of the}} left-hand glove aging, or of the corrosion products...|$|E

25|$|Some {{consider}} a dry suit mandatory; however, a thick wetsuit may be sufficient for hardier divers. A wetsuit can be pre-heated by pouring warm {{water into the}} suit. A hood and gloves (recommended three-finger mitts or dry <b>gloves</b> with <b>rings)</b> are necessary, and dry suit divers {{have the option of}} using hoods and gloves that keep their head and hands dry. Some prefer to use a full face diving mask to essentially eliminate any contact with the cold water.|$|R
5000|$|A {{one-piece}} pressure garment assembly with integrated pressure bladders and ventilation system. Oxygen is {{fed through}} a connector at the wearer's left thigh and is {{transmitted to the}} helmet, via a special connector {{at the base of}} the neckring. The helmet and gloves are connected to the suit, via locking rings, a metallic gray in color (Gemini suits featured a gray neck ring and red and blue anodized <b>glove</b> <b>rings).</b> The suit has a Nomex cover layer in international orange color, instead of silver or white as in previous David Clark suits. The orange color allows rescue units to easily spot the astronauts in the case of an Orbiter bailout over the ocean. Underneath the suits, astronauts wear [...] "Maximum Absorbency Garment" [...] (MAGs) urine-containment trunks (resembling incontinence shorts) and blue-colored thermal underwear, which has plastic tubing woven into the garments allowing for liquid cooling and ventilation, the latter being handled by a connector located on the astronaut's left waist. The pressure bladder uses a [...] "breathable" [...] material that, while maintaining pressure, allows perspiration to exit and prevents liquids from entering, this is an improvement over the non-breathable pressure bladder used for the LES.|$|R
25|$|In the 12th century, the abbots of Fulda claimed {{precedence}} of {{the archbishop}} of Cologne.

60|$|Sir Richard and Welland had put {{on their}} oldest great-coats and shabbiest wideawakes; they had also put off their <b>gloves</b> and <b>rings</b> and breastpins {{in order to attract}} as little {{attention}} as possible, but nothing that they could have done could have reduced their habiliments to anything like the garments of the poor creatures with whom they now mingled. If they had worn the same garments for months or years without washing them, and had often slept in them out of doors in dirty places, they might perhaps have brought them to the same level, but not otherwise.|$|R

40|$|Innovations in {{technology}} {{has changed the}} traditional laparoscopy to be less invasive. Singleport transumbilical laparoscopy has emerged to enhance the cosmetic benefits and to decrease the morbidity of the minimally invasive surgery. It has further minimized the minimally invasive surgery. However, this technique requires a specialized multichannel port (for introducing laparoscope and instruments) which is very costly and in fact, is not affordable {{by the majority of}} the population in a developing country like India. We have improvised a single-port access system using readily available materials like surgical <b>gloves,</b> towel <b>ring,</b> inner flexible ring and conventional laparoscopic trocars with no added cost burden to the patient. We have performed 40 single port surgeries using this method without any complications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a smart tactile sensing and actuation-based finger-glove {{to be used}} by visual and hearing impaired people for communication and learning. It is based on the concept of finger Braille and supports both face-to-face and distant communication. The device comprises of a smart finger-glove worn on both hands in the ring, middle and index finger and communicates with mobile devices using Bluetooth technology. Six tactile sensors and actuators each were used and a pair embedded in the <b>glove</b> in the <b>ring,</b> middle, and index fingers of both hands to represent the six dots of the Braille code. The user wears the smart finger-glove and taps the correct finger combination corresponding to the Braille code on any surface to compose and send messages to mobile devices or other gloves. Messages can equally be received with the glove from a mobile device in the form of vibrations on the fingers corresponding to the Braille codes. The facile and low-cost nature of the device will make it attractive to Braille users and makes learning Braille an entertainment activity and could spur the interest of sighted people also to learn Braille...|$|R
40|$|Twas in a grove I met my love, One {{soft and}} balmy night; I own‚Äôd my flame, {{she did the}} same, And trembled with delight; When at her gate we parted late, I bless‚Äôd my lucky stars, And stole a kiss to seal our bliss, Between the wicket bars. I went again but sought in vain, The grove my love to find; I fear‚Äôd the worst and yet I durst Not think she was unkind; To solve my fate I sought the gate, And there Oh! Happy stars, I found and press‚Äôd her to my breast, And kiss‚Äôd her thro‚Äô the bars. I ask‚Äôd her why she did not fly, Like me on wings of love, To where our vows beneath the boughs, Were whisper‚Äôd in the grove; She said of late the garden gate, Seem‚Äôd nearer to the stars, The hint was plain, and so again I kiss‚Äôd her thro‚Äô the bars. But kissing leads to graver deeds, And {{constant}} visions brings, Of golden show‚Äôrs and orange flow‚Äôrs, White <b>gloves</b> and wedding <b>rings,</b> And now our fate no envious gate, With wicked wicket mars, For wedded fast, we‚Äôve learn‚Äôd to last To kiss without the bars...|$|R
5000|$|The best word I {{can think}} of to {{describe}} that tour is 'glorious.' Our record hadn't become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people.

People were going crazy, {{and they had no}} idea who we were! ‚ÄîTommy Shannon in a 2000 interview After the 1983 release of Texas Flood, Double Trouble embarked on the Texas Flood Tour in support of the album. The tour began with a series of small club performances in mid-1983. Double Trouble toured North America as an opening act for The Moody Blues in October through November 1983; for these performances, the band received $5,000 per show and a bonus for successful ticket sales. Double Trouble received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values. The tour included a performance on Austin City Limits, which was broadcast for PBS on February 28, 1984. The band also performed a sold-out show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Variety described the performance by calling Vaughan [...] "the guitar hero of the present era".|$|R
40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 gloveboxes, This represents nearly half of the gloveboxes in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The gloveboxes and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron shielding. Window mountings, <b>glove</b> port <b>rings,</b> site gages, bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The gloveboxes and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. Gloveboxes and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most gloveboxes are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a reliable, low cost, average size, light weight, simple, rugged, and compact design five fingers real time smart glove and a measurement hand gripper that emulate the human hand functions that {{can be used as a}} prototype model for hand rehabilitation systems for patients suffering from paralyze or contracture. The hand gripper device will move based on a human operator‚Äôs finger movement using the smart <b>glove.</b> Index, Middle, <b>ring,</b> and little fingers of the hand have a three degree of freedom, while the thumb finger has a two degree of freedom. All fingers are equipped with sensors for a smooth precise movement on a small scale with a perfect incision and without any vibration. This gripper is ideal for light objects. All the fingers have high speed motion and can be controlled individually and this gives the gripper ability to grasp complex shaped objects this work contains two PIC 18 F 452 microcontrollers for the instrumentation, communication and controlling applications. A series of flex sensors are built-in a master glove to get readings from the movement of human fingers. Microcontrollers will further use this information to control multiple servos that controls the movement of the slave hand...|$|R
50|$|Android #18 is {{introduced}} wearing a denim jacket and skirt, dark blue leggings, brown {{boots and a}} black shirt with black and white sleeves. After arriving at Goku's home, she gains a new outfit, first seen when she is depicted going through his wife Chi-Chi's closet; a white short sleeve shirt underneath a black vest, a pair of blue green jeans, black <b>gloves</b> with a <b>ring</b> on the left arm and black flats with orange socks. It is never stated where the outfit originated for nor where she acquired it. During the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, she wears a black shirt with black and white sleeves, blue jeans, and black flats with orange socks. In Battle of Gods, her clothing changes again; she wears a black shirt with purple sleeves, light blue jeans, a pearl necklace with a thunder pendant embedded on it and black flats with white socks. Her attire remains mostly unchanged for the sequel Resurrection 'F' apart from her no longer wearing the necklace and wearing blue boots. In Dragon Ball GT, Android 18 is shown with two different outfits. The first is a red long sleeve turtleneck with black pants and red high heels with earrings. The second is a purple blazer with a pink undershirt and matching pants alongside the same red heels and earrings from earlier.|$|R
6000|$|The {{elaborate}} solemnities of funerals were {{in accordance}} with the sombre character of the times. In cases of ordinary death, the printer seldom fails to notice that the corpse was [...] "very decently interred." [...] But when some mightier mortal has yielded to his fate, the decease of the [...] "worshipful" [...] such-a-one is announced, with all his titles of deacon, justice, councillor, and colonel; then follows an heraldic sketch of his honorable ancestors, and lastly an account of the black pomp of his funeral, and the liberal expenditure of scarfs, <b>gloves,</b> and mourning <b>rings.</b> The burial train glides slowly before us, as we have seen it represented in the woodcuts of that day, the coffin, and the bearers, and the lamentable friends, trailing their long black garments, while grim Death, a most misshapen skeleton, with all kinds of doleful emblems, stalks hideously in front. There was a coach maker at this period, one John Lucas, who scents to have gained the chief of his living by letting out a sable coach to funerals. It would not be fair, however, to leave quite so dismal an impression on the reader's mind; nor should it be forgotten that happiness may walk soberly in dark attire, as well as dance lightsomely in a gala-dress. And this reminds us that there is an incidental notice of the [...] "dancing-school near the Orange-Tree," [...] whence we may infer that the salutatory art was occasionally practised, though perhaps chastened into a characteristic gravity of movement. This pastime was probably confined to the aristocratic circle, of which the royal governor was the centre. But we are scandalized at the attempt of Jonathan Furness to introduce a more reprehensible amusement: he challenges the whole country to match his black gelding in a race for a hundred pounds, to be decided on Metonomy Common or Chelsea Beach. Nothing as to the manners of the times can be inferred from this freak of an individual. There were no daily and continual opportunities of being merry; but sometimes the people rejoiced, in their own peculiar fashion, oftener with a calm, religious smile than with a broad laugh, as when they feasted, like one great family, at Thanksgiving time, or indulged a livelier mirth throughout the pleasant days of Election-week. This latter was the true holiday season of New England. Military musters were too seriously important in that warlike time to be classed among amusements; but they stirred up and enlivened the public mind, and were occasions of solemn festival to the governor and great men of the province, {{at the expense of the}} field-offices. The Revolution blotted a feast-day out of our calendar; for the anniversary of the king's birth appears to have been celebrated with most imposing pomp, by salutes from Castle William, a military parade, a grand dinner at the town-house, and a brilliant illumination in the evening. There was nothing forced nor feigned in these testimonials of loyalty to George the Second. So long as they dreaded the re-establishment of a popish dynasty, the people were fervent for the house of Hanover: and, besides, the immediate magistracy of the country was a barrier between the monarch and the occasional discontents of the colonies; the waves of faction sometimes reached the governor's chair, but never swelled against the throne. Thus, until oppression was felt to proceed from the king's own hand, New England rejoiced with her whole heart on his Majesty's birthday.|$|R
