40|$|Auxin is a {{structurally}} simple molecule, yet it elicits {{many different}} responses in plants. In Chapter 1 {{we have reviewed}} how specificity in the output of auxin signaling could be generated by distinct regulation and the unique properties {{of the members of}} the Aux/IAA and ARF transcription factor families. In Chapter 2 we further investigated the generation of specificity in auxin responses by generating a set of sensitive transcriptional reporter lines for all Arabidopsis ARFs. This facilitated a comprehensive identification of the ARF complement within a cell/tissue of interest. Our analysis of ARF expression in the root meristem revealed both ubiquitous and specific ARF expression patterns and ARF subsets that distinguished the actively dividing cells from those undergoing elongation. Moreover, a striking correlation between cell type and ARF expression patterns was revealed in the early Arabidopsis embryo, where each cell type expressed a unique ARF complement. In Chapter 3 we characterized a novel cell-autonomous auxin response is required for hypophysis specification and root meristem initiation, and identify Aux/IAA and ARF transcription factors that mediate this response. We show that auxin response components in the proembryo and the suspensor are intrinsically different, and their regulated, lineage-specific expression creates a prepattern enabling different developmental auxin responses. Surprisingly, we find that, in addition to mediating hypophysis specification, auxin response also acts to maintain suspensor cell identity. We show that auxin controlled maintenance of suspensor cell identity includes repression of the embryonic program. This finding gave us an experimental system in which to investigate suspensor cell identity and <b>embryonic</b> <b>transformation.</b>   In Chapter 4 the targeted and specific inhibition of auxin response in the suspensor was coupled to new embryo dissection techniques and a microarray based approach was used to generate a unique dataset which was subsequently mined for cell identity regulators. Unexpectedly, inhibition of auxin response induced the misregulation of thousands of genes, prior to gross morphological changes, revealing a high degree of transcriptional plasticity in these cells. This complicated the identification of regulators. Moreover, the dataset also included secondary/indirect changes in embryo expressed genes, which were inevitable given the connectivity and developmental connectedness between the embryo and suspensor. One of the most striking findings from analysis of the dataset generated in Chapter 4 was the convergent regulation of members of many gene families involved in all facets of auxin homeostasis, as investigated in Chapter 5. It appears that transient auxin response inhibition is sensed as an auxin minimum and in general auxin homeostasis genes were activated or repressed in such a way that would increase cellular auxin levels (and response). Finally, many bHLH superfamily members were misregulated upon the inhibition of suspensor auxin response and subsequently found to have specific expression patterns in the embryo, the focus of in Chapter 6. Several bHLHs were shown to lose their lineage specific expression patterns upon inhibition of auxin response in the suspensor, validating further research to place these factors into the auxin response pathways controlling cell identity in the embryo.  ...|$|E

50|$|During <b>embryonic</b> development, <b>transformation</b> of the flat, two-layer {{germinal}} disc into a three-dimensional body depends on transition of some cells from an epithelial phenotype to spindle-shaped cells with motile behaviour, a mesenchymal phenotype. This process {{is referred to}} as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Later in embryonic development, MET is crucial for gastrulation, angiogenesis, myoblast migration, bone remodeling, and nerve sprouting among others. MET is essential for embryogenesis, because MET −/− mice die in utero due to severe defects in placental development. Along with Ectodysplasin A, it {{has been shown to be}} involved in the differentiation of anatomical placodes, precursors of scales, feathers and hair follicles in vertebrates.

40|$|AKT {{activation}} requires phosphorylation of {{the activation}} loop (T 308) by 3 -phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK 1) and the hydrophobic motif (S 473) by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC 2). We recently observed that phosphorylation of the AKT hydrophobic motif was dramatically elevated, rather than decreased, in mTOR knockout heart tissues, indicating {{the existence of}} other kinase(s) contributing to AKT phosphorylation. Here we show that the atypical IκB kinase ε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (IKKε/TBK 1) phosphorylate AKT on both the hydrophobic motif and the activation loop in a manner dependent on PI 3 K signaling. This dual phosphorylation results in a robust AKT activation in vitro. Consistently, we found that growth factors can induce AKT (S 473) phosphorylation in Rictor−/− cells, and this effect is insensitive to mTOR inhibitor Torin 1. In IKKε/TBK 1 double-knockout cells, AKT activation by growth factors is compromised. We also observed that TBK 1 expression is elevated in the mTOR knockout heart tissues, and that TBK 1 is required for Ras-induced mouse <b>embryonic</b> fibroblast <b>transformation.</b> Our observations suggest a physiological function of IKKε/TBK 1 in AKT regulation and a possible mechanism of IKKε/TBK 1 in oncogenesis by activating AKT...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila gene fushi tarazu (ftz) encodes a homeodomain-containing {{transcriptional}} regulator (Ftz) {{required at}} several stages during development. Drosophila melanogaster ftz (Dm-ftz) is first expressed in seven stripes defining alternate parasegments of the embryo—a “pair-rule” segmentation function [1, 2]. It is then expressed in specific neural precursor {{cells in the}} central nervous system and finally in the developing hindgut [3]. An Orthopteran ortholog of ftz (Sg-ftz, formally Dax) has been isolated from the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria[4]. The pattern of Sg-ftz expression in Schistocerca embryos suggests that some developmental roles of the ftz gene are likely to be conserved between these two species (e. g., CNS functions) while others may have diverged (e. g., segmentation functions). To test whether the function of the Ftz protein itself differs between these two species, here we compare the functions of Sg-Ftz and Dm-Ftz proteins by expressing both in Drosophila embryos. Sg-ftz mimics only poorly several segmentation roles of Dm-ftz (engrailed activation, wingless repression, and <b>embryonic</b> cuticle <b>transformation).</b> However, the two proteins are similarly active in the rescue of a CNS-specific ftz mutant.

40|$|Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are chromatin-modifying {{enzymes that}} are {{involved}} in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and development. HDAC inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis in tumor cells and are therefore promising antitumor agents. Numerous genes were found to be deregulated upon HDAC inhibitor treatment; however, the relevant target enzymes are still unidentified. HDAC 1 is required for mouse development and unrestricted proliferation of embryonic stem cells. We show here that HDAC 1 reversibly regulates cellular proliferation and represses the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 in embryonic stem cells. Disruption of the p 21 gene rescues the proliferation phenotype of HDAC 1 (-/-) embryonic stem cells but not the embryonic lethality of HDAC 1 (-/-) mice. In the absence of HDAC 1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts scarcely undergo spontaneous immortalization and display increased p 21 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a direct regulation of the p 21 gene by HDAC 1 in mouse <b>embryonic</b> fibroblasts. <b>Transformation</b> with simian virus 40 large T antigen or ablation of p 21 restores normal immortalization of primary HDAC 1 (-/-) fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that repression of the p 21 gene is crucial for HDAC 1 -mediated control of proliferation and immortalization. HDAC 1 might therefore be one of the relevant targets for HDAC inhibitors as anticancer drugs...|$|R

5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that <b>embryonic</b> development recapitulated <b>transformations</b> of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|R
40|$|The transmembrane adaptor protein Cbp (or PAG 1) {{functions}} as a suppressor of Src-mediated tumor progression by promoting the inactivation of Src. The expression of Cbp is down-regulated in Src-transformed cells and in various human cancer cells, suggesting a potential role for Cbp as a tumor suppressor. However, the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of Cbp remain unknown. The present study shows that Cbp expression is down-regulated by epigenetic histone modifications via the MAPK/PI 3 K pathway. In mouse <b>embryonic</b> fibroblasts, <b>transformation</b> by oncogenic Src and Ras induced a marked down-regulation of Cbp expression. The levels of Cbp expression were inversely correlated with the activity of MEK and Akt, and Cbp down-regulation was suppressed by inhibiting MEK and PI 3 K. Src transformation {{did not affect the}} stability of Cbp mRNA, the transcriptional activity of the cbp promoter, or the DNA methylation status of the cbp promoter CpG islands. However, Cbp expression was restored by treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC 1 / 2. Src transformation significantly decreased the acetylation levels of histone H 4 and increased the trimethylation levels of histone H 3 lysine 27 in the cbp promoter. EGF-induced Cbp down-regulation was also suppressed by inhibiting MEK and HDAC. Furthermore, the inhibition of MEK or HDAC restored Cbp expression in human cancer cells harboring Cbp down-regulation through promoter hypomethylation. These findings suggest that Cbp down-regulation is primarily mediated by epigenetic histone modifications via oncogenic MAPK/PI 3 K pathways in a subset of cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} myxoma, the most {{frequent}} tumour of the heart, remains uncertain. Previous phenotypic characterizations have shown heterogeneous results {{and the most recent}} hypothesis suggests that cardiac myxoma originates from a primitive pluripotential cardiogenic cell. We investigated the expression of actin isoforms in 30 left atrial myxomas by immunohistochemistry and in eight consecutive tumours by RT-PCR. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein and/or transcripts were detected in all cases, whereas alpha-cardiac actin was observed in few cases and alpha-skeletal actin was always absent. Besides classical features, vessel-like structures were characterized by cells expressing CD 34 and, less frequently, alpha-SMA. Confocal microscopy showed focal co-expression of CD 34 and alpha-SMA in myxoma cells, suggesting a gradual loss of stem endothelial markers and the acquisition of myocytic antigens. In order to confirm this hypothesis, early cardiac differentiation markers were also investigated. RT-PCR documented the presence of transcripts for Sox 9 (100 %), Notch 1 (87. 5 %), NFATc 1 (37. 5 %), Smad 6, metalloproteinases 1 and 2 alone or in variable combinations and the absence of ErbB 3 and WT 1. Myxoma cells maintained phenotypic heterogeneity in vitro, including the expression of alpha-SMA and the presence of stress fibres. These findings document in cardiac myxoma cells phenotypic markers of the <b>embryonic</b> endothelial-to-mesenchymal <b>transformation</b> that precedes terminal differentiation of endocardial cushions, supporting the hypothesis that cardiac myxonia cells may derive from adult developmental remnants.

40|$|MDMX is an {{important}} regulator of p 53 during <b>embryonic</b> development andmalignant <b>transformation.</b> Previous studies showed that casein kinase 1 (CK 1) stably associates withMDMX, stimulates MDMX-p 53 binding, and cooperates with MDMX to inactivate p 53. However, the mechanism by which CK 1 stimulates MDMX-p 53 interaction remains unknown. Here, we present evidence that p 53 binding by theMDMXN-terminal domain is inhibited by the central acidic region through an in-tramolecular interaction that competes for the p 53 binding pocket. CK 1 binding to theMDMX central domain and phosphory-lation of S 289 disrupts the intramolecular interaction, allowing the N terminus to bind p 53 with increased affinity. After DNA damage, the MDMX-CK 1 complex is disrupted by Chk 2 -mediated phosphorylation of MDMX at S 367, leading to reduced MDMX-p 53 binding. Therefore, CK 1 is {{an important}} functional partner of MDMX. DNA damage activates p 53 in part by dis-rupting CK 1 -MDMX interaction and reducingMDMX-p 53 binding affinity. The p 53 tumor suppressor can be activated by numerous cellu-lar and environmental signals and induces the expression of genes that regulate metabolism, cell growth, division, and apop-tosis (49). MDM 2 and MDMX are key regulatory proteins that control p 53 level and transcriptional activity. Recent studies sug-gested that the MDM 2 /MDMX module is largely responsible for enabling p 53 to be highly responsive to stress, thus maintainin...|$|R
40|$|Fibronectin (FN) has {{a complex}} pattern of {{alternative}} splicing at the mRNA level. One of the alternatively spliced segments, EDA, is prominently expressed during biological processes involving substantial cell migration and proliferation, such as <b>embryonic</b> development, malignant <b>transformation,</b> and wound healing. To examine {{the function of}} the EDA segment, we overexpressed recombinant FN isoforms with or without EDA in CHO cells and compared their cell-adhesive activities using purified proteins. EDA+ FN was significantly more potent than EDA− FN in promoting cell spreading and cell migration, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} a second alternatively spliced segment, EDB. The cell spreading activity of EDA+ FN was not affected by antibodies recognizing the EDA segment but was abolished by antibodies against integrin α 5 and β 1 subunits and by Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide, indicating that the EDA segment enhanced the cell-adhesive activity of FN by potentiating the interaction of FN with integrin α 5 β 1. In support of this conclusion, purified integrin α 5 β 1 bound more avidly to EDA+ FN than to EDA− FN. Augmentation of integrin binding by the EDA segment was, however, observed only in the context of the intact FN molecule, since the difference in integrin-binding activity between EDA+ FN and EDA− FN was abolished after limited proteolysis with thermolysin. Consistent with this observation, binding of integrin α 5 β 1 to a recombinant FN fragment, consisting of the central cell-binding domain and the adjacent heparin-binding domain Hep 2, was not affected by insertion of the EDA segment. Since the insertion of an extra type III module such as EDA into an array of repeated type III modules is expected to rotate the polypeptide up to 180 ° at the position of the insertion, the conformation of the FN molecule may be globally altered upon insertion of the EDA segment, resulting in an increased exposure of the RGD motif in III 10 module and/or local unfolding of the module. Our results suggest that alternative splicing at the EDA exon is a novel mechanism for up-regulating integrin-binding affinity of FN operating when enhanced migration and proliferation of cells are required...|$|R
40|$|ROR alpha 1 and RVR are orphan {{members of}} the {{superfamily}} of nuclear hormone receptors which constitutively activate and repress, respectively, gene transcription by binding to a common DNA sequence. In an attempt to understand the physiological functions of these two transcription factors, we aimed to identify target genes. We have identified a consensus binding site for ROR alpha 1 and RVR in the first intron of the N-myc gene that we designated N-myc RORE (ROR response element). Unlike most of the intronic sequence, the region encompassing the N-myc RORE is highly conserved between human and mouse, underscoring its importance. Our studies revealed that ROR alpha 1 and RVR specifically bind to the human and mouse N-myc ROREs and transactivate and transrepress, respectively, reporter constructs containing the ROREs. Moreover, Northern blot analysis demonstrated a direct modulation of an exogenously introduced N-myc gene by ROR alpha 1 and RVR in COS- 1 cells. This effect is mediated through the N-myc RORE, since mutation of this site abolished the regulatory effects of both receptors. While transfection of ROR alpha 1 in P 19 embryonic carcinoma cells {{had no effect on}} the levels of endogenous N-myc mRNA, RVR down-regulated its expression. The regulatory function of the N-myc RORE was further demonstrated by the rat <b>embryonic</b> fibroblast (REF) <b>transformation</b> assay. Mutation of the RORE increased the oncogenic potential of the N-myc gene in the REF assay. The foci were more numerous and significantly larger with the mutated than with the wild-type N-myc gene, regardless of ROR alpha 1 or RVR expression. Moreover, concomitant expression of ROR alpha 1 and wild-type N-myc resulted in a twofold {{increase in the number of}} transformed foci. In contrast, RVR expression resulted in the formation of foci that could be established as permanent clones with a very low frequency compared to foci transformed in its absence. These observations show that ablation of the RORE results in a more oncogenic form of N-myc and suggest that deregulation of the activity of the ROR alpha 1 and RVR could contribute to the initiation and progression of certain neoplasias...|$|R
