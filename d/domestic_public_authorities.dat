40|$|I {{start this}} paper by {{addressing}} Kant’s question why rightful interactions require both <b>domestic</b> <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> (or states) and a global public authority? Of central importance are two issues: first, {{the identification of}} problems insoluble without public authorities, and second, why a domestic public monopoly on coercion can be rightfully established and maintained by coercive means while a global public monopoly on coercion cannot be established once and for all. In {{the second part of}} the paper, I address the nature of the institutional structure of individual states and of the global authority. Crucial here, I argue, is Kant’s distinction between private and public right. Private right concerns rightful relations between individual legal subjects, where public right concerns their claims on their public institutions. I propose that the distinction between private and public right should be central to liberal critiques of current legal and political developments in the global sphere...|$|E
40|$|Non-compliance with EU (environmental) law {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a 'southern problem'. Because of specific features of their political systems, the four southern European member states are believed to lack the capacity for effectively implementing EU policies. In contrast, I argue in this article that, first, there is significant variation in compliance with EU environmental laws across the European member states which cannot be accommodated by a simple north-south divide. Second, the comparative study of the implementation of five different EU environmental policies in Spain and Germany shows that compliance may vary across different policies within one country. The article puts forward a model which allows us to explain variation across both member states and policies. It is argued that non-compliance is most likely if an EU policy causes a significant 'policy misfit' and if there is no mobilization of <b>domestic</b> actors pressurizing <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to bear the costs of implementing the 'misfitting' policy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In <b>domestic</b> legal systems, <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> have {{incorporated}} rules first established by private bodies {{for a long}} time. In the global arena, public regulatory regimes increasingly connect with private ones. International intergovernmental organizations, transnational regulatory networks and the EU use international standards and rules coming from private entities {{through a variety of}} mechanisms. Examples include the FSB's incorporation of international auditing standards, the Basel Committee's reference to credit rating agencies, the WTO agreements' connection with international standards established by private bodies and the EU endorsement of international accounting standards. Notwithstanding the different context in which they are operating, traditional techniques [...] such as incorporation and reference [...] are surprisingly resilient. Yet, tools at first sight originating from the plain transplantation of instruments well know within national legal orders end up being used for new purposes. Moreover, in some cases systems drawing upon old tools enact new and more complex models. Concerns about hybrid public-private regulation - under which conditions can a <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> delegate rulemaking functions to private ones? How can the accountability of private entities be pursued? - are old dilemmas. The transplantation of techniques from the national to the global level often aims at finding new solutions to old problems, which appear even more complex in the global arena. The analysis shows that in some cases tools addressing legitimacy concerns, such as procedural ones, seem to be more developed in the global context than in national ones â€ even though not necessarily more efficacy in enhancing accountability comes with the development in the number of these tools. harmonisation; regulations; standardisation; international trade; accountability; European Commission...|$|R

Drawing upon a database of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> located in three Italian Regions, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of green procurement adoption. In particular, using an econometrical approach we tested the following propositions: i) the existing awareness on GPP practices, tools and regulations does support <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to develop GPP strategies; (ii) the support of external experts in purchasing function does support <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to develop GPP practices; (iii) the small dimension of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is an obstacle to adopting GPP practices; (iv) ISO 14001 certified <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are more likely to}} develop GPP practices. The econometric analysis shows that the dimension of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> and the level of awareness of the existing tools for supporting GPP have a positive and significant effect on the probability that they adopt GPP practices. green <b>public</b> procurement, local <b>authorities,</b> ISO 14001, environment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{political}} accountability under various contractual forms of Public Private Partnerships. A critical aspect of any PPP contract is {{the allocation of}} demand risk between the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> and the private provider. We show that contracts in which the private provider bears all demand risk motivate more the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from responding to customer needs, since they empower consumers, which provides the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> with more credibility in side-trading. The policy implication is that the current greater resort to contracts in which the <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> retains all demand risk may not be optimal in terms of allocative efficiency. ...|$|R

50|$|New York {{state public}} benefit {{corporations}} and authorities operate like quasi-private corporations, with {{boards of directors}} appointed by elected officials, overseeing both publicly operated and privately operated systems. <b>Public</b> <b>authorities</b> share characteristics with government agencies, but they are exempt from many state and local regulations. Of particular importance, they can issue their own debt, allowing them to bypass limits on state debt contained in the New York State Constitution. This allows <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without directly putting the credit of New York State or its municipalities on the line. As a result, <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> have become widely used for financing public works, and they are now responsible for more than 90% of the state's debt. The growing influence of <b>public</b> <b>authorities</b> over state and local financing, coupled with their ability to avoid regulations applicable to government agencies, has led to calls for reform. Some reforms were passed in the <b>Public</b> <b>Authorities</b> Accountability Act of 2005.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{systematic}} literature review {{to suggest that}} three emerging critical approaches {{to the production of}} <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are identifiable within the contemporary literature on conflict-affected and transitioning regions. The authors term these approaches the ‘public authority from below perspective’, the ‘hybrid political orders lens’, and ‘political settlements analysis’. Although hailing from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, the paper argues that these approaches share important traits. First, they suggest that to understand better the nature of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in transitioning and conflict-affected regions it is necessary to uncover how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> actually works rather than departing from a theory of the state. This includes accounting for how power is legitimated and practiced within each context, and how claims to <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> are connected to the provision of public goods such as security and justice. Second, they view competition, conflict and contestation as enduring features of <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> in such contexts, and call for empirical examinations of these processes to inform understandings of social change. Third, these approaches argue that <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is an emergent property, always in production and never definitively formed. This implies that neat dichotomies such as formal/informal, private/public, and modern/traditional should be applied with caution by analysts seeking to understand <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> from the perspective of people living with insecurity and change. Despite these similarities, the paper's conclusion suggests that these approaches should be unpacked and their normative assumptions challenged. Each can then be drawn upon to arrive at empirical understandings of how <b>public</b> <b>authority</b> is produced and exercised, and how it relates to the provision of public goods in conflict-affected and transitioning regions...|$|R
