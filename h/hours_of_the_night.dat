5|$|The {{majority}} of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from Amduat ('That Which is in the Underworld'), which describes the journey of the sun god through the twelve <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated with the Book of Gates, which shows the sun god passing through the twelve gates that divide the nighttime and ensures the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. These earliest tombs were generally sparsely decorated, and those of a non-royal nature were totally undecorated.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of Victor Peirce in episode eight {{is portrayed as}} taking place in his car {{at the front of}} his home, but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight. However, Thompson was shot dead at around 9:30 pm, and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, as he began to drive off in his car, directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre. Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Astronomy {{played a}} {{considerable}} part in religious matters for fixing {{the dates of}} festivals and determining the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> The titles of several temple books are preserved recording the movements and phases of the sun, moon and stars. The rising of Sirius (Egyptian: Sopdet, Greek: Sothis) {{at the beginning of}} the inundation was a particularly important point to fix in the yearly calendar.|$|E

Sniper fire was directed especially at unit leaders and radio operators. The Vietcong continued to fight {{until the late}} <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> from 2200 to 2400. They then withdrew but continued to harass American positions with mortar and rocket fire. All American operations conducted in the Can Tho area used maximum naval and air assets.|$|E
25|$|The {{teaching}} in the Talmud Torah consumed the whole day, and in the winter months a few <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> besides. Teaching was suspended in the afternoon of Friday, and in {{the afternoon of the}} day preceding a holy day. On Sabbaths and holy days no new lessons were assigned; but the work of the previous week was reviewed on Sabbath afternoons by the child's parent or guardian (Shulḥan 'Aruk, Yoreh De'ah, 245).|$|E
25|$|In June 1868 she {{relocated}} to Lima in Peru at {{the advice of}} her new Franciscan spiritual director Pedro Gual where she lived in the Dominican convent at Patrocinio despite not being a nun. It was here that she followed a demanding schedule of eight hours of reflection which was offered in silence and solitude. In addition she devoted four <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> to various forms of mortification which included flagellation and the wearing of a crown of thorns. In terms of nourishment she fasted on bread and water alone and took the Eucharist as her sole form of sustenance while was sometimes seen in an ecstatic state.|$|E

25|$|The zoo, {{which is}} open {{every day of}} the year except Yom Kippur, Yom HaShoah, and Yom Hazikaron, {{schedules}} special activities on selected dates. Tree-planting activities are an annual Tu Bishvat tradition. On both days of Purim there is a parade, a family costume competition, and a tug of war between the entire Hapoel Jerusalem Basketball Team and one of the elephants (the elephant always wins). On Israel's Election Day, zoo goers are encouraged to vote for their favorite animal. During the summer, the zoo conducts tours of nocturnal animals in the wee <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> It also schedules jazz concerts, juggling, and workshops during school vacations.|$|E
25|$|Miller has {{collected}} two Turkish traditions about {{the fall of}} Trebizond. One tells how {{the citizens of the}} city, expecting an army to arrive before dawn that would force the Sultan to lift the siege, agreed to surrender at cock-crow. However, on that occasion the roosters crowed in the small <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> whereupon the Turks forced the city-dwellers to keep their word. The other describes how a girl, dressed in black, held out in the tower of the palace, and when all was lost, leaped to her death from its heights; consequently that tower was called Kara kızın saray ("The Black Girl's palace").|$|E
25|$|From {{the tables}} of {{stars on the}} ceiling of the tombs of Rameses VI and Rameses IX it seems that for fixing the <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> a man seated on the ground faced the Astrologer in such a {{position}} that the line of observation of the pole star passed over the middle of his head. On the different days of the year each hour was determined by a fixed star culminating or nearly culminating in it, and the position of these stars at the time is given in the tables as in the centre, on the left eye, on the right shoulder, etc. According to the texts, in founding or rebuilding temples the north axis was determined by the same apparatus, and we may conclude that it was the usual one for astronomical observations. In careful hands it might give results of a high degree of accuracy.|$|E

50|$|Another {{feature of}} this ancient {{practice}} is that, unlike the standard modern 12-hour clock that assigns 12 o'clock pm for noon time, in the ancient Jewish tradition noon time was always <b>the</b> sixth <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, whereas the first hour began with <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> dawn, by most exponents of Jewish law, and with sunrise by the Vilna Gaon and Rabbi Hai Gaon. 12:o'clock am (midnight) was also <b>the</b> sixth <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> whereas <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> began when <b>the</b> first three stars appeared in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky.|$|R
25|$|The battlecruisers {{were ordered}} to take {{positions}} at the rear behind II Squadron, because of their severe battle damage. Admiral Hipper {{had been forced to}} leave his flagship SMS Lützow and had some trouble boarding another ship {{in the course of the}} battle. At 2115 he boarded SMS Moltke and again assumed command, initially mistakenly ordering the ships to move to the head of the column. Only SMS Seydlitz and Moltke could immediately comply: SMS Derfflinger had too many holes to travel at speed, and SMS Von der Tann needed to clean ash from her boilers forcing her to steam slowly. When Derfflinger and Von der Tann drew abreast of the flagship SMS Friedrich der Grosse, Scheer once again ordered them to the rear. The two joined the end of the German column, but Seydlitz and Moltke remained out of position initially ahead of the fleet and had to move independently through the British fleet. Lützow proceeded southwards behind the fleet for the first couple of <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> at the best speed she could manage, seven knots, but eventually sank at 0145.|$|E
25|$|In the Mahabharata, Durvasa {{is known}} for {{granting}} boons {{to those who had}} pleased him, particularly when he had been served well as an honoured guest. An example of such behaviour is the episode between him and Kunti, the future wife of Pandu and the mother of the Pandavas. When Kunti was a young girl, she lived in the house of her adopted father, Kuntibhoja. Durvasa visited Kuntibhoja one day and sought his hospitality. The king entrusted the sage to his daughter's care and tasked Kunti with the responsibility of entertaining the sage and meeting all his needs during his stay with them. Kunti patiently put up with Durvasa's temper and his unreasonable requests (such as demanding food at odd <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night)</b> and served the sage with great dedication. Eventually, the sage was gratified. Before departing, he rewarded Kunti by teaching her the Atharvaveda mantras, which enables a woman to invoke any god of her choice to beget children by them. Curious and skeptical, Kunti decided to test the mantra. After invoking Surya, the son god, she bore her first son, Karna. Fearing the fate of an unwed mother, she placed the newborn in a basket and set him afloat down a river. The infant Karna was later found and raised by Adhiratha, a charioteer for the monarch of Hastinapur, and his wife Radha. Soon after this episode, Kunti was married to Pandu, the king of Hastinapur, and, by invoking those same mantras taught to her by Durvasa, she bore the three eldest of Pandu's five sons. Karna would go on to become an accomplished warrior and a formidable adversary of the Pandavas. This enmity would eventually culminate in his death on the battlefield of Kurukshetra at the hands of Arjuna, his younger brother, who was unaware of their fraternal bond.|$|E
500|$|Hillel Slovak {{was born}} in Haifa, Israel, to Jewish parents who were {{survivors}} of the Holocaust. The family emigrated to the U.S. when Slovak was five years old. [...] They settled in the Queens borough of New York City, then in 1967 relocated to Southern California. As a child, Slovak developed an interest in art, and would often spend time painting with his mother, Esther. He attended Laurel Elementary School in West Hollywood and Bancroft Jr. High School in Hollywood, where he met future bandmates Jack Irons and Michael [...] "Flea" [...] Balzary. Slovak received his first guitar at age 13 as a bar mitzvah present, and would often play the instrument into the late <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> [...] During this time, he was highly influenced by hard rock music such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Kiss.|$|E

500|$|According {{to his own}} estimate, Davidson {{approached}} around 150 to 200 girls a {{year over}} a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants at all <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the [...] "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was [...] "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".|$|E
500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E
