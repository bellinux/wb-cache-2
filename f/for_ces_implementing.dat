40|$|Today, many {{companies}} are interested in improving their competitive position in the marketplace, and hence, compete by bringing new products and value added services to the market in a timely fashion, at low cost and enhanced quality. Concurrent Engineering (CE), a new methodology and a systematic approach to the integrated design of products and related processes including manufacture and support is ideal, for this environment. Organizations <b>implement</b> <b>CE</b> to achieve specific goals. This thesis focuses on the goals of time, cost and quality <b>for</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>CE.</b> The existence of specific models or methods of implementation of <b>CE</b> <b>for</b> specific goals has been investigated and metrics for specific models classified. Case studies of organizations <b>implementing</b> <b>CE</b> are outlined and differences in implementations pointed out. Organizations focusing on time put. more emphasis on stages/activities between detailed specification and detailed design stages in a CE NPD process. Organizations focusing on quality and cost put more emphasis on the stages/activities between preliminary design and volume production. Metrics <b>for</b> <b>CE</b> processes targeting specific goals have also been classified. However, {{it has been found}} that metrics are not restricted to specific goals...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of concurrent engineering (CE) {{within the software}} and manufacturing industries has led to significant benefits including improved time-to-market, reduced production cost, improved product quality and active customer involvement. The implementation of CE within construction {{is also expected to}} result in positive changes within the industry, as CE has the potential to make construction projects less fragmented, improve project quality, reduce construction time and cut total project cost. It is considered essential within other industries to carry out a readiness assessment of an organization before <b>implementing</b> <b>CE.</b> Therefore, to facilitate the {{adoption of}} CE within the construction industry, it is necessary to assess the extent to which organizations in the industry are ready <b>for</b> <b>CE.</b> This would help an organization to view its current performance and areas of weakness so that corrective action could be taken. This paper discusses CE and its implementation within the construction industry and highlights the need <b>for</b> <b>CE</b> readiness assessment. It argues {{that there is a need}} for a specific readiness assessment tool for the construction industry and describes the development of a CE readiness assessment model for the construction industry - the BEACON model. The benefits of using the BEACON model are discussed and strategies and considerations <b>for</b> <b>CE</b> implementation are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Recently the Circular Economy (CE) {{concept has}} gained {{momentum}} in the Netherlands, propounding that environmental impact reduction can provide a significant positive economical impulse. The government, larger parts of the industry as a whole, {{as well as the}} construction industry, has warmly received this approach. At first sight the CE concept connects over two centuries of sustainability thinking together in a relatively seen rather coherent framework. So, CE in its constituent elements doesn’t provide anything new. It is the economic framework uniting the elements, which makes CE a new and challenging approach. Insofar the Dutch construction industry is concerned, based on the extensive experiences of the authors over the past years, the CE concept gets a fragmented, incoherent and eclectic interpretation. In the paper, departing from the concept of the ‘homo-economicus’ (Mill, 1836), and the free market theory (Malthus, 1826) CE, is re-defined into ‘Radical CE’ attempting to constitute a CE theory and terminology, appropriate for the construction industry and addressing the core of the CE concept in terms of a sustainable industry and society, behaving as such because of economic incentives. Based on the concept of ‘Radical CE’, the paper describes and evaluates several CE cases. The paper concludes with some guidelines and strategies <b>for</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>CE.</b> Management in the Built EnvironmentArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} {{and principles of}} Concurrent Engineering (CE) {{have been around for}} over a decade. In fact the literature is full of examples, studies and surveys advocating the potential accruable benefits of <b>implementing</b> <b>CE,</b> However, how to introduce it in a guided and holistic manner has received lesser attention. This paper attempts to fill this gap by reporting on a 3. 5 -year research study exploring and investigating the pertinent issues <b>for</b> <b>CE.</b> The research project was called PACE - a 'Practical Approach to Concurrent Engineering', and was a European Commission funded project consisting of a pan-European consortium. Its aim was to provide a holistic technology transfer infrastructure enabling the effective change and improvement of present engineering practices towards CE principles. The paper explores these issues based on three research questions posed at the outset of this study. The paper is split into four major sections. The first introductory part provides the rationale for this research study in terms of motivation and why the need for such a project by reviewing past studies and developments in the CE domain. This section is followed by a conceptual model which forms the basis of a CE knowledge platform. The third section reports on a set of complementary decision support tools <b>for</b> <b>CE</b> in practice. It is then argued that <b>implementing</b> <b>CE</b> successfully requires a huge cultural change in an organisation. A generic implementation support framework forms the basis for the final section before the concluding summary. Two case studies are used to illustrate the implementation of research findings and developments in multinational companies...|$|R
