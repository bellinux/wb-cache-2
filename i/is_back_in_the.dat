Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a [...] "powerhouse ballad", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] (1995).

2500|$|The {{demand for}} {{condensate}} for oil sands diluent {{is expected to}} be more than [...] by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about [...] of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport.

The surplus American condensate and light oil is [...] being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product.
