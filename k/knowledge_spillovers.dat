2500|$|A 2017 {{study in}} the Journal of Political Economy by Daron Acemogu, James Robinson and Thierry Verdier argues that American [...] "cutthroat" [...] {{capitalism}} and inequality gives rise to technology and innovation that more [...] "cuddly" [...] forms of capitalism cannot. As a result, [...] "the diversity of institutions we observe among relatively advanced countries, ranging from greater inequality and risk-taking in the United States to the more egalitarian societies supported by a strong safety net in Scandinavia, rather than reflecting differences in fundamentals between the citizens of these societies, may emerge as a mutually self-reinforcing world equilibrium. If so, in this equilibrium, “we cannot all be like the Scandinavians,” because Scandinavian capitalism depends {{in part on the}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillovers</b> created by the more cutthroat American capitalism." [...] A 2012 working paper by the same authors, making similar arguments, was challenged by Lane Kenworthy, who posited that, among other things, the Nordic countries are consistently ranked as some of the world's most innovative countries by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, with Sweden ranking as the most innovative nation, followed by Finland, for 2012–2013; the U.S. ranked sixth.|$|E

5000|$|Cultural Commodification and Colonialism. Some {{critics have}} argued that {{cultural}} policy in Abu Dhabi represents the epitome of a paradigmatic shift {{in our understanding of}} culture today, that is, its redefinition as a commodity within a business-based, transnational setting. In other words, the critique recites, the Emirate is not investing enough {{in the development of a}} genuinely local culture but is simply purchasing, or better, leasing, a “ready-made” cultural package from western institutions such as the Louvre or the Guggenheim. In doing so, furthermore, it voluntarily replicates the dynamic of colonialism and succumbs to western influences. Art historian Poulin, however, is sceptic about this latter view. He argues that these developments are not being imposed on the Rulers and that, rather, it could be a strategy aimed at attracting best practices with the hope for <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillovers.</b> Nonetheless, he continues, the dynamic indeed introduces a new form of domination: that of money over culture. Financial resources are invested in culture functionally to acquire dominance in the regional context. On the other hand, former director of the Guggenheim Museum Thomas Krens disagrees. In his view, projects like Saadiyat island are not about [...] "exporting a commodity" [...] or [...] "setting up a franchise" [...] but rather engage with the aim of establishing communication, interaction and cooperation, so to foster innovation and local talents.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} local <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillovers</b> for the innovative and economic performance of firms in a developing country context. Theoretical and empirical studies in advanced economies underline the significance of local <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillovers</b> for innovation.

40|$|Dynamic externalities, {{associated}} with <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillover,</b> {{is regarded as}} the "engine of growth". Recent theories of economic growth have stressed the role of <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillover</b> in generating growth. Such <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillover</b> are particularly effective in cities, where communication among people is most intensive as well as extensive. In relation to dynamic externalities, the specialization of an industry in a city helps <b>knowledge</b> <b>spillover</b> between firms and stimulates growth of a particular industry and of a particular city. These are called as MAR externalities. On the other hand, variety and diversity of geographically proximate industries promote innovation and growth rather than geographical specialization. Those are called as Jacobs externalities. In addition, there is an argument on the effectiveness of competitions within an industry. To examine the impact of dynamic externalities in Korea, the analysis is conducted using a data set on the growth of several industries in 79 Korea Cities between the period of 1995 and 2000. The results show that Jacobs externalities tends to work on only high-tech manufacturing industries. In Seoul Metropolitan Area(SMA), the impact of dynamic externalities on several industries such as the paper manufacturing industries, the high-tech manufacturing industries and the high-order services industries are larger than those of non-SMA cities. clos...|$|R
