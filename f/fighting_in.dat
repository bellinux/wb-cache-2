5|$|After the <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion {{participated in}} the Italian Campaign, <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino.

After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to Florence while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{personnel}} {{also took}} part in the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces {{until the end of the}} war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties suffered by the Allied air forces during the <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Normandy and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to the <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. Other relatives also served with the division, including two nephews. The <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the phalanx {{was that it}} was only effective when <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> large, open spaces, which left the Romans at a disadvantage when <b>fighting</b> <b>in</b> the hilly terrain of the central Italian peninsula. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC; it is more likely, however, that they were copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second Samnite War (326 to 304 BC).|$|E
5|$|Similar to <b>{{fighting}}</b> <b>in</b> ice hockey, {{fighting is}} tolerated in professional box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian Lacrosse Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. <b>Fighting</b> <b>in</b> youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable. Violators were {{ejected from the}} game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension.|$|E
