50|$|Ergot {{is a type}} of fungus {{that tends}} to grow on cereals and grasses, {{including}} rye. The fungus Claviceps spp. infects the flowering head and replaces grain of the rye with an ergot that’s a hard and compact fungal mycelium, deep purple in color. In addition, sweet ergot honeydew oozes from these flowering heads. Insects often feed on this exudate and serve as vectors that carry it from source to source. Examination of Polistes dorsalis during their foraging behavior found presence of fungal conidia on various parts of their body including antennae, mouthparts, and in their gut. Therefore, this species of wasp has been identified as one of these insects, potentially transmitting this causal ergot fungus. This is part of the wasp’s foraging behavior, as it is focused on exclusively locating fungal infected grasses and collecting this ergot honeydew. P. dorsalis carries the droplets in their mouthparts from infected grass like Paspalum dilatatum Pior, then crawls or moves through <b>hopping</b> <b>flights</b> towards other florets in the area. Polistes can also differentiate infected grass heads from uninfected ones, and usually land on uninfected grasses for grooming purposes only. Stopping on these grooming sites increase the likelihood of them serving as vectors for the spread of fungal infection, in addition to visiting various grass species during foraging.|$|R

40|$|Land-surface {{heterogeneity}} (LSH) {{at different}} scales has {{significant influence on}} atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) buoyant and shear turbulence generation and transfers of water, carbon and heat. The extent of proliferation of this influence into larger-scale circulations and atmospheric structures is a topic continually investigated in experimental and numerical studies, in many cases with the hopes of improving land-atmosphere parameterizations for modeling purposes. The blending height is a potential metric for the vertical propagation of LSH effects into the ABL, and {{has been the subject}} of study for several decades. Proper assessment of the efficacy of blending height theory invites the combination of observations throughout ABLs above different LSH scales with model simulations of the observed ABL and LSH conditions. The central goal of this project is to develop an apt and thoroughly scrutinized method for procuring ABL observations that are accurately detrended and justifiably relevant for such a study, referred to here as Detrending with Empirical Mode Decomposition (DEMD). The Duke University helicopter observation platform (HOP) provides ABL data [wind (u, v, and w), temperature (T), moisture (q), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) ] at a wide range of altitudes, especially in the lower ABL, where LSH effects are most prominent, and where other aircraft-based platforms cannot fly. Also, lower airspeeds translate to higher resolution of the scalars and fluxes needed to evaluate blending height theory. To confirm noninterference of the main rotor downwash with the HOP sensors, and also to identify optimal airspeeds, analytical, numerical, and observational studies are presented. Analytical analysis clears the main rotor downwash from the HOP nose at airspeeds above 10 m s - 1. Numerical models find an acceptable range from 20 - 40 m s - 1, due to a growing compressed air preceding the HOP nose. The first observational study finds no impact of different HOP airspeeds on measurements from ~ 18 m s - 1 to ~ 55 m s - 1 over a stable marine boundary layer (MBL). Another set of observations studies HOP and tower data, using the Duke University Mobile Micrometeorological Station (MMS) over an MBL, and concludes that HOP sensible heat (SH), latent heat (LE), and carbon dioxide (F CO 2) fluxes align well with MMS findings. The HOP sensors provide ABL data at 40 Hz, as well as a real-time display of θ for in-flight ABL height estimation. Sensor calibration and alignment procedures indicate usable ABL measurements. HOP data are especially susceptible to the spurious influence of platform motion on ABL data, largely due to the low-altitude and low-airspeed capabilities of the HOP. For example, HOP altitude motion in the presence of a lapse rate can cause spurious T fluctuations. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can separate HOP data into a set of adaptive and unique intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), often with physical meaning. DEMD aims to correct for spurious contributions to HOP data, while merging EMD with a correlation analysis to adjust data without eliminating relevant ABL dynamics. To evaluate DEMD efficacy, two-dimensional synthetic T fields with simulated turbulence over a prescribed lapse rate are sampled with altitude fluctuations similar to <b>HOP</b> <b>flights,</b> and with a wide range of T perturbation and sampling path parameter variations. DEMD recovers the prescribed lapse rate within 1 % on average for the 552 test cases passing the filtering criteria. The method is further evaluated via application to vertical cross sections taken from the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM) large-eddy simulation (LES) results, where DEMD shows improved accuracy of SH recovery. DEMD is applied to three low-altitude <b>HOP</b> <b>flight</b> legs flown on 19 June 2007 during the Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC), both as an example of practical application and to compare DEMD to the initially proposed method (Holder et al. 2011, hereafter H 11). H 11 dictates the elimination of correlated IMFs, along with other subtle differences from DEMD, which also eliminates any ABL motions embedded in those IMFs. As suspected, the H 11 method produces marked reductions of variances and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and substantial deviations in SH, LE, and F CO 2 compared to DEMD. DEMD detrends without unnecessary elimination. DEMD is vital for ensuring accurate scalars and fluxes from HOP data, and a strategy for future research is presented that integrates properly detrended observations from the CLASIC HOP dataset with OLAM simulations to explore LSH effects on ABL processes and evaluate blending height theory.

40|$|As {{e-commerce}} {{has become}} more popular, the problem of information overload {{has come to the}} fore. Recommender systems that reduce the information overload problem are becoming more common. However, the problem with many recommender systems is that they are associated with a high cost of learning customer preferences (in terms of cognitive load). We describe the Personal Travel Assistant (PTA), a flight recommender application that uses case-based reasoning (CBR) to overcome these problems. The PTA allows users to search multiple flights providers concurrently and recommends flights based on their individual travel preferences. These preferences are implicitly learned from observations of user behaviour. When the user purchases a flight, the PTA uses the selection of a preferred flight to discover and refine the user 2 ̆ 7 s overall travel preferences. These preferences are stored in a user-model as sets of cases representing their interactions, which are used to provide personalised recommendations. The PTA makes recommendations taking into account {{the context in which the}} flights were offered. It uses features from the request to determine this context, e. g. the duration of the trip. We perform evaluations of contextual recommendations that support our view that user preferences change depending on the context of the session. We further improve recommendation accuracy by storing and personalising similarity measures in the user-model. The PTA alters the relative importance of features in the personal similarity measure based on implicit user feedback, e. g. increasing the importance of price at the cost of stop-over time in a multiple <b>hop</b> <b>flight.</b> We also investigate cooperative components to extend our recommendation strategies. These allow users to reuse the information learned from other users when they encounter new situations. However, these techniques are not as successful as we had hoped. We discuss these components in relation to other work on collaborative recommendation and suggest that the standard approach is unsuited to the PTA 2 ̆ 7 s context-based recommendation strategy. The strength of CBR in the e-commerce domain stems from its reuse of the knowledge base associated with a particular application.

40|$|Spatial {{variability}} of the Earth's surface has a considerable {{impact on the}} atmosphere at all scales and understanding the mechanisms involved in land-atmosphere interactions is hindered by the scarcity of appropriate observations. A measurement gap exists between traditional point sensors and large aircraft and satellite-based sensors in collecting measurements of atmospheric quantities. Point sensors are capable of making long time series of measurements, but cannot make measurements of spatial variability. Large aircraft and satellites make measurements over large spatial areas, but with poor spatial and temporal resolution. A helicopter-based platform can make measurements on scales relevant for towers, especially close to the Earth's surface, and can extend these measurements to account for spatial variability. Thus, the Duke University Helicopter Observation Platform (HOP) is designed to fill the existing measurement gap. Because measurements must be made {{in such a way}} that they are as uncontaminated by the platform itself as much as is possible, it is necessary to quantify the aerodynamic envelope of the HOP. The results of an analytical analysis of the location of the main rotor wake at various airspeeds are shown. Similarly, the results of a numerical analysis using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software Fluent are shown. The optimal flight speed for the sampling of turbulent fluxes is found to be around 30 m/s. At this airspeed, the sensors located in front of the nose of the HOP are in advance of the wake generated by the main rotor. This airspeed is also low enough that the region of high pressure due to the stagnation point on the nose of the HOP does not protrude far enough forward to affect the sensors. Measurements of differential pressures, variables and turbulent fluxes made while flying the HOP at different airspeeds support these results. No systematic effects of the platform are seen at airspeeds above about 10 m/s. Processing of HOP data collected using the current set of sensors is discussed, including the novel use of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to detrend and filter the data. The EMD separates the data into a finite number of Impirical Mode Functions (IMFs), each of which is unique and orthogonal. The basis is determined by the data itself, so that it need not be known a priori, and it is adaptive. The EMD is shown to be an ideal tool for the filtering and detrending of HOP data using data gathered during the Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC). The ability of the HOP to accurately measure atmospheric profiles of potential temperature is demonstrated. During experiments conducted in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and the convective boundary layer (CBL), HOP profiles are evaluated using profiles from an elastic backscatter lidar. The HOP and the lidar agree on the height of the boundary layer in both cases, and the HOP effectively locates other atmospheric structures. Atmospheric sensible and latent heat fluxes, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and horizontal momentum fluxes are also measured, and the resulting information is used to provide context to tower-based data collected concurrently. A brief comparison made over homogeneous ocean conditions yields good results. A more exhaustive evaluation is made using short <b>HOP</b> <b>flights</b> made over an orchard during the Canopy Horizontal Turbulence Study (CHATS). Dissertatio...|$|R

Therefore, symmorphosis is upheld {{in the design of}} the tracheal system, but not in relation to the amount of mitochondria, which might be due to other factors operating at the molecular level.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents two new systematic feedback {{approaches for}} set point feedback stabilization of drift free systems which employ Lie algebraic techniques. Due to some special features, drift free systems {{are known to}} be difficult to stabilize. For such systems, linearization, and state feedback linearization techniques, fail to be useful. In this dissertation two new feedback approaches the guiding functions approach and the trajectory interception approach are introduced. The importance of these approaches is due to their simplicity {{and the fact that they}} do not require any special transformation techniques. The guiding functions approach delivers piece-wise constant control sequences and relies on the construction of special guiding functions which are not Lyapunov functions. However, a comparison of their values allows to determine a desired direction of system motion and permits to construct a sequence of controls such that the sum of these guiding functions decreases in an average sense. The guiding functions strategy is first analysed with reference to systems which appear in a special rectified form and requires the construction of as many guiding functions as there are control variables. Later, this approach is extended to apply to general drift free systems and usually results in the construction of only a pair of guiding functions. The most important feature of this strategy is that it often leads to dead beat control. For higher order systems, a combined strategy which employs sinusoidal steering in conjunction with the guiding functions approach is also examined. The trajectory interception approach provides a universal method for the construction of time varying stabilizing feedback control for drift free systems. The resulting feedback law is a composition of a standard stabilising feedback control for a Lie bracket extension of the original system and a periodic continuation of a specific solution to an open loop, finite horizon control problem stated in terms of a formal equation on a Lie group. The open loop problem is solved as a trajectory interception problem in logarithmic coordinates of flows. The construction proposed in this approach demonstrates that synthesis of time varying feedback stabilizers for drift free systems can be viewed as a procedure of combining static feedback laws for a Lie bracket extension of the system. This approach is employed to drift free systems which are characterized by both nilpotent and non-nilpotent controllability Lie algebras. The applicability of both approaches is demonstrated on a variety of drift free systems with different algebraic structures: a unicycle, Brockett's system, a front wheel drive car, a rigid spacecraft, a <b>hopping</b> robot in <b>flight</b> phase, an underwater vehicle, a fire truck, a mobile robot with trailer, and a class of wheeled mobile robots.
