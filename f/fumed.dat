40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the road asphalt <b>fumes</b> in the process of construction, the paper {{proposed}} to add some substances in asphalt to reduce the yield of asphalt <b>fumes.</b> Firstly, considering the theory of how the asphalt <b>fumes</b> come into being in the process of construction on the pavement, six possible additives to restrain these <b>fumes</b> havd been screened out. And tests of <b>fumes</b> suppression effect had been done to get the results that: SBS has a good effect of <b>fumes</b> suppression. When added by 3 %, the asphalt <b>fumes</b> reduced by the rate of 19. 2 %; PE has an suppressive effect on asphalt <b>fumes.</b> When added by 3 %, the asphalt <b>fumes</b> reduced by the rate of 6. 5 %; Melamine has a good effect of <b>fumes</b> suppression.

5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was <b>fumed</b> twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|Born on 18 January 1770 at Obernai in the French {{province}} of Alsace, Beker was {{serving as a}} dragoon in the royal army {{at the beginning of}} the French Revolution.

As a staff officer he was present at an unusual event during the Battle of Limburg. On the night of 16 September 1796 he notified the commander of the right flank division, Jean Castelbert de Castelverd that the Austrians had won a crossing of the Lahn River at Diez but that French forces had sealed off the bridgehead. At this, the division commander panicked and ordered an immediate retreat despite positive orders to hold the river line. This opened a gaping hole in the French lines and led to a general retreat. When later asked privately about his actions, Castelverd <b>fumed</b> that the rest of the army was looking for an excuse to withdraw. Castelverd was later removed from command for his failure.|$|E

500|$|Ammonia fuming is a wood {{finishing}} process that darkens wood and {{brings out the}} grain pattern. [...] It consists of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood.
