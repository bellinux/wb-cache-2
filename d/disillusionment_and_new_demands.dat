Both medium-term cycles {{such as the}} Southern Oscillation and longer term climate change contribute uncertainty in additional to that arising from seasonal fluctuations. It follows that uncertainty is an inherent feature of water management in Australia. In addition, the policy process itself generates uncertainty. As new knowledge about water systems emerges <b>and</b> <b>new</b> <b>demands,</b> such as increased concerns about environmental flows, arise, policies must adjust. The adjustment process inevitably creates uncertainty for both <b>new</b> <b>and</b> existing water users.
