40|$|The task of {{word sense}} {{disambiguation}} is to assign a sense label to a word in a passage. We report our algorithms and experiments for the two tasks that we participated in viz. the task of WSD of Word-Net <b>glosses</b> and the task of WSD of English lexical sample. For both the tasks, we explore a method of sense disambiguation {{through a process of}} “compar-ing ” the current context for a word against a reposi-tory of contextual clues or <b>glosses</b> for each sense of each word. We compile these <b>glosses</b> in two differ-ent ways for the two tasks. For the first task, these <b>glosses</b> are all compiled using WordNet and are of various types viz. hypernymy <b>glosses,</b> holonymy mixture, descriptive <b>glosses</b> and some hybrid mix-tures of these <b>glosses.</b> The “comparison ” could be done {{in a variety of ways}} that could include/exclude stemming, expansion of one <b>gloss</b> type with another <b>gloss</b> type, etc. The results show that the system does best when stemming is used and <b>glosses</b> are expanded. However, it appears that the evidence for word-senses,accumulated through WordNet, in the form of <b>glosses,</b> are quite sparse. Generating dense <b>glosses</b> for all WordNet senses requires a massive sense tagged corpus- which is currently unavail-able.

40|$|The {{variation}} of the appearance such as <b>gloss</b> provides {{one of the most}} important information for object recognition. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms related to the perception of <b>gloss.</b> We examined whether the neurons in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of the monkeys are coding <b>gloss</b> of objects. We made visual stimuli which have various surface reflectance properties, and tested responses of IT neurons to these stimuli while a monkey was performing a visual fixation task. We found that there exist neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus that selectively responded to specific stimuli. The selectivity was largely maintained when the object shape or illumination condition was changed. In contrast, neural selectivity was lost when the pixels of objects were randomly rearranged. In the former manipulation of the stimuli, <b>gloss</b> perceptions were maintained, whereas in the latter manipulation, <b>gloss</b> perception was dramatically changed. These results indicate that these IT neurons selectively responded to <b>gloss,</b> not to the irrelevant local image features or average luminance or color. Next, to understand how the responses of <b>gloss</b> selective neurons are related to perceived <b>gloss,</b> responses of <b>gloss</b> selective neurons were mapped in perceptual <b>gloss</b> space in which glossiness changes uniformly. I found that responses of most <b>gloss</b> selective neurons can be explained by linear combinations of two parameters that are shown to be important for <b>gloss</b> perception.

25|$|Neither {{the use of}} {{graphite}} nor {{sodium nitrate}} was new. <b>Glossing</b> gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder {{had been made in}} Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapacá (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make blasting powder using this sodium nitrate. The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the planthunter, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.|$|E

When briefing the Shah about matters of state, he began {{to take part in}} the <b>glossing</b> over the political troubles that the government's policies were creating. He also helped to secure his own position of power by feeding into the Shah's vanity by carrying out policies that increased the ever-growing cult of personality surrounding the monarch, while at the same time executing the Shah's every wish in politics. The Shah responded favorably to these displays of fealty, and these actions secured Hoveyda's place as a loyal member of the Shah's government. The toleration of corruption, as well as constant attacks in the press towards him (usually by journalists who wanted to indirectly criticize the Shah, but were unable to do so openly because of censorship laws) made Hoveyda an increasingly disliked and mocked figure among common Iranians. Hoveyda himself due to the isolating nature of Iranian politics became increasingly unaware of those tensions himself. No longer considered a reformer by most, he was seen instead as an ultimate insider, who not only kowtowed to the government's policies, but actively promulgated it.|$|E
