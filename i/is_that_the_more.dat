25|$|Dog {{fighting}} is often {{considered one of}} the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because they often suffer their entire lives. At least one major study alleges that the prevailing mind set among dog fighters <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> the dog suffers, the tougher he will become, and the better fighter he will therefore be. This position and the resulting treatment afforded the dogs stand in stark contrast with prevailing public values regarding the treatment of dogs in many civilized societies.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{location}} for burials {{of members of the}} Jewish community is uncertain. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> visible and accessible cemetery utilised by Christians, near the border with Spain, was more subject to the laws regarding expulsion of Jews, which had been mandated by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The best-preserved gravestones at Jews' Gate Cemetery are those that, until recently, were protected by a layer of mud and peat. The inscriptions on the limestone tombstones that have been exposed to the elements have become difficult to decipher. During half of the year, the winter and spring, plants are allowed to grow freely in the cemetery, in deference to the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society. The area is a favoured mating and nesting ground of the Barbary partridge; after their nesting season, the cemetery is cleared and the impression of neglect is removed.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{political}} science professors questioned whether Obama's speech {{would have the}} effect he hoped for in terms of distancing himself from the controversial comments made by Wright and allaying the concerns {{of a number of}} white voters. Michael Munger—head of the {{political science}} department at Duke University, and a Libertarian candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 2008—called the speech [...] "brave", but said that Obama was [...] "being naive". Munger argued that [...] " [...] black candidate named Barack Hussein Obama can't have questions about his patriotism, and commitment to America, not if he is going to beat a genuine war hero" [...] (a reference to John McCain and the general election). He argued that Obama [...] "had to distance himself far from Wright. Instead, he was brave." [...] Susan B.

Similarly, Eric Plutzer of Penn State argued that Obama's speech [...] "did not put the Rev. Wright controversy behind him. Those skeptical of Obama are likely to continue to distribute video clips, and quotes of Obama's own words, to argue that his reaction was not sufficiently strong..." ...|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} 19 {{harpsichord}} suites and several variation sets. The suites follow {{the standard model}} (Allemande – Sarabande – Courante – Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande {{or a couple of}} doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French lute style brisé, sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, Johann Mattheson mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.|$|R

Nature has good intentions, of course, but, as Aristotle once said, she cannot carry them out. When I look at a landscape I cannot help seeing all its defects. It is fortunate for us, however, that Nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we should have no art at all. Art is our spirited protest, our gallant attempt to teach Nature her proper place. As for the infinite variety of Nature, that is a pure myth. It {{is not to be}} found in Nature herself. It resides in the imagination, or fancy, or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her.|$|E
