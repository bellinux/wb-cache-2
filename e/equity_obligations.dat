5000|$|The Seattle-based bank {{holding company}} Washington Mutual {{declared}} bankruptcy on September 26, 2008. The 120-year-old company, {{one of the largest}} banking institutions in the US West, was driven into bankruptcy by the subprime crises. On the previous day, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) announced that it closed the holding company's primary operating subsidiary, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, and had placed it into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC sold the assets, all deposit accounts, and secured liabilities to JPMorgan Chase, but not unsecured debt or <b>equity</b> <b>obligations.</b> [...] Washington Mutual Savings Bank's closure and receivership is the largest U.S. bank failure in history. Kerry Killinger, the CEO from 1988 to August 2008, had been fired by the board of directors. Virtually all savings and checking account holders were not affected as the accounts were insured by the FDIC during the collapse, and subsequently transferred in whole to JPMorgan Chase. The holding company, Washington Mutual Inc was left without its major asset and equity investment, its former subsidiary Washington Mutual Savings Bank, and filed for bankruptcty the following day, the 26th.|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Managing {{the diverse}} {{production}} and support teams on mining operations in Southern Africa {{is proving to}} be problematic and challenging. Many mines are facing strikes, “go-slows” and destructive conflict related to diversity issues. The objective of this case study was to evaluate the apparent successful diversity management practices employed at Benga Mine (an MCC Group mine) in Mozambique. The study aimed to determine the success of the tactics employed by the management team and whether successful tactics can be utilised at other mines operating within the MCC Group. The case study evaluated seven practical diversity management tactics employed by the management of the mine as conceptual method. The seven tactics were verified through a literature review and an eighth “other” category was provided for additional tactics that the research may reveal. The research revealed that the diversity management tactics at Benga Mine have some strengths and some weaknesses. The management team focused on translation of communication to the primary spoken languages on the mine. This enabled good communication flow, but further improvements can be made. Most employees identify with the Benga Mine and feel a sense of common purpose. The management team identified nutrition as a critical diversity management issue. This was an accurate observation as the research revealed that the availability and quality of food is of fundamental importance to them. Further improvement, such as catering for vegetarians, can be made to the food offerings. Strong relationships exist on the mine and this is the area where the Benga Mine management team excel. Employees feel that issues on importance can be addressed through various communication platforms and that their concerns are being taken seriously. Employees believe that all groups have the opportunity to raise issues and that the management team evaluate their concerns with compassion and care. The sound communication system employed at Benga Mine builds relationships and promotes a culture where employees can engage with management. The management of employment equity policies poses a significant challenge to the mine. The expats manage and pose the bulk of technical and operational expertise, resulting in significant risk to the sustainability of the business since the work permit quota system requires knowledge transfer to Mozambique citizens. Additionally, the work environment is not conducive to gender equality and female employees feel marginalised. An organisational culture conducive to managing and valuing the contribution and presence of all groups has been created at the mine. Further improvement can be made by terminating tokens of separations such as different uniforms for managers and operational employees. No significant new or additional diversity management factors were identified during the research. Benga Mine’s diversity management tactics are effective, but improvements can easily be achieved by focusing on the recommendations of this case study. The recommendations include improvements to translation of management instructions, clarification of employment <b>equity</b> <b>obligations</b> and a higher degree of sensitivity to the needs of female employees...|$|E

A claim for breach {{of confidence}} will only be made out, however, when it is shown that the confidee has misused {{the information to the}} detriment of the confider. Fiduciary law, however, is concerned with the duty of loyalty and does not require that harm result. Duties of confidence, unlike fiduciary obligations, can arise outside a direct relationship. Another difference is that breach of confidence also has a jurisdictional base at law, and accordingly can draw on remedies available in both law and <b>equity,</b> whereas fiduciary <b>obligations</b> arise only in equity and can only draw upon equitable remedies.|$|R

40|$|China's {{power sector}} has {{experienced}} unprecedented growth {{during the past}} three decades. This paper examines three major phases of reform from 1985 to 2008 that contributed to this growth. Before 1980, electricity was largely considered a social service. Investments were fully funded through budget allocations and the sector was administratively controlled by the government. Economic reforms in 1978, however, fueled GDP growth which, in turn, induced a surge in electricity demand that the power sector struggled to meet. The first wave of electricity reforms in the mid- 1980 s were designed gradually to mobilize investment funds to alleviate power shortages. These reforms included a shift from funding the development of the sector through budget allocations to <b>equity</b> and debt <b>obligations</b> incurred directly by power companies and experimentation with foreign investment through joint ventures. A new phase of reforms commenced in 1996 with the adoption of the Electricity Law. The law, which was designed to reconfigure the power sector with a socialist market economy and to protect consumers, defined the rights and responsibilities of power enterprises and established provincial power companies as "single buyers". Though these reforms increased th...|$|R

Based on the critical evaluation of various scientific approaches to interpretation of the essence of financial instruments, the author’s definition is proposed. Thus, it is advisable to consider them as means, techniques and methods of attracting financial resources (capital) from other entities and as absolutely liquid assets. The generalization and rethinking of the criteria for classification of financial instruments allowed the authors to divide them into financial assets (cash, bank metals, currency), financial <b>obligations</b> (<b>equity</b> and debt instruments), and instruments of irrevocable financial aid (charitable contributions, grants, crowdfunding, fundraising). The received methodological conclusions quite fully characterize the essence and variety of types of financial instruments, taking into account their principal properties, which will allow to make a well-considered justification for choosing the optimal instruments for the modernization of the electric power sector...|$|R

Zbog drugačijeg načina organiziranja kapitalističkoga društva, ideje stakeholdinga vraćaju se općim načelima sloboda, zajedništva, jednakosti i solidarnosti, ali se povezuju i sa traženjem sigurnostii stabilnosti u vremenu neprekidnih promjena. Taj pristup dosad se najviše razvio u literaturi o djelovanju korporacija i zadaćama korporacijskog menadžmenta i autor najveći dio članka posvećuje analizi između toga pristupa i drugih koncepata. The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} critical review of past discussions, scope and problems correlated to stake-holders approach. Due to different manner of organization of capitalistsociety, ideas of stake-holders return to general principles of freedom, unity and solidarity, but they are also associated with search for safety and stability in time of continuous changes. Stake-holder is a person who has interest(share) in activity of special organizations (entities), and owing to this he can demand to be informed and consulted about activity of organization and to participate in decision-making. So far, stake-holders approach developed most in literature which described activity of corporations and tasks of corporation management. Therefore, the article mostly dealswith analysis of differences between this approach and other concepts of majority of disputable questions of activity of corporation and principles of stake-holders management. Somewhat modest results have been achieved in conceiving stake-holders economy. It exists there where reciprocity of <b>equities</b> and <b>obligations</b> is built around the concept of economic, social and political integration, aimed to correct defficiencies of market. Problems appear due to different levels on which stake-holders integration develops. The higher level is (sector, national economics, supernational associations) the more difficult realization of interest of particular stake-holder is. The concluding part discusses several essential disputable questions and critiques of stake-holders approach, pointing out here objective difficulties which influence scientific contributions of this approach. The contributions of this approach are pointed out as well: a) empirical research of corporation management and, b) analysis of privatization of public enterprises, what can be effcient approach for solution of the same problems in East European transitional countries...|$|R

Exploring the complex relationship between land reform and sustainable development through a critical analysis {{of the concept of}} sustainable livelihoods, we argue that a strong ethical case for land reform as a component of sustainable development can be constructed by appealing to principles such as justice, <b>equity</b> and the <b>obligations</b> that we have towards fellow humans, as well as the environment, but fail to discharge if land reform is neglected. The case against land reform and its importance for sustainable livelihoods and sustainable development is also considered. We argue that this case is either inconclusive, or at best shows limits to the value of land reform in certain contexts only. It also suggests pitfalls to be avoided when land reform is being introduced, and can thus be regarded as enhancing the case for land reform that avoids such pitfalls. We furthermore argue that the complex set of relations that emerges proves to justify increased emphasis on implementation of land reform as a contribution towards sustainable development.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explain the meaning and {{function}} of conscience in commercial law doctrine. It argues {{that the idea of}} conscience in law bears its ordinary meaning. When the courts use the language of conscience, they are simply expressing a moral judgement about whether, e. g. the defendant’s behaviour or a particular state of affairs conforms to the commonly held standards of right and wrong to which we all have access and of which we are all expected to be aware. The thesis argues further that the language of conscience has a discernible but very limited function in commercial law doctrine. It helps us to understand that in recognising and enforcing <b>obligations,</b> <b>equity</b> is giving effect to moral obligations, and that it will not do so unless the individual on whom the obligation is to be imposed has knowledge of the relevant facts. However, beyond this, the language of conscience has little, if any, explanatory force. For example, it tells us nothing about the moral principles underpinning particular doctrines, nor does it tell us what or how much an individual must know before it will be reasonable to treat her as subject to an obligation. In fact, the courts’ tendency to invoke the language of conscience and unconscionability without regard to the limits of its explanatory power means that a number of important doctrinal questions remain perpetually unanswered and sometimes obscured. Therefore, the thesis concludes that the courts should not continue to use the language of conscience without paying much greater attention to what it can and cannot explain...|$|R
40|$|Background. Despite common {{recognition}} of joint responsibility for global health by all countries particularly to ensure justice in global health, current discussions of countries’ obligations for global health largely ignore obligations of developing countries. This is especially {{the case with}} regards to obligations relating to health financing. Bearing in mind {{that it is not}} possible to achieve justice in global health without achieving equity in health financing at both domestic and global levels, our aim is to show how fulfilling the obligation we propose will make it easy to achieve equity in health financing at both domestic and international levels. Discussion. Achieving equity in global health financing is a crucial step towards achieving justice in global health. Our general view is that current discussions on global health <b>equity</b> largely ignore <b>obligations</b> of Low Income Country (LIC) governments and we recommend that these obligations should be mainstreamed in current discussions. While we recognise that various obligations need to be fulfilled in order to ultimately achieve justice in global health, for lack of space we prioritise obligations for health financing. Basing on the evidence that in most LICs health is not given priority in annual budget allocations, we propose that LIC governments should bear an obligation to allocate a certain minimum percent of their annual domestic budget resources to health, while they await external resources to supplement domestic ones. We recommend and demonstrate a mechanism for coordinating this obligation so that if the resulting obligations are fulfilled by both LIC and HIC governments it will be easy to achieve equity in global health financing. Summary. Although achieving justice in global health will depend on fulfilment of different categories of obligations, ensuring inter- and intra-country equity in health financing is pivotal. This can be achieved by requiring all LIC governments to allocate a certain optimal per cent of their domestic budget resources to health while they await external resources to top up in order to cover the whole cost of the minimum health opportunities for LIC citizens. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} settlement-date {{accounting}} for equity share options {{can be seen}} as an accounting method which implements a shareholder focused residually rewarded partners’ equity view. This equity view represents a simple, natural extension of the shareholder proprietary view. It implicates an equity and income sharing model for accounting which is characterized by specification of both shareholders’ and non-shareholders’ parts of total equity and income. When using this equity and income sharing model, the remeasurements of <b>equity</b> share option <b>obligations</b> made by settlement-date accounting are fully conceptually valid. They represent measurements of one partner group’s share of total equity with effect for another group’s share of total equity and income: the shareholders’ part. Partially, this equity and income sharing model is already the basis for existing accounting standards. It is shown that an intriguing implication of the equity and income sharing model is the fact that treasury shares can hedge present shareholders’ share price risk from the obligation to holders of equity share options. A special hedge accounting construct is needed to account for this hedge effect, and the construct of this model is shown. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the long run expense effects for shareholders from equity share options by settlement-date accounting both when the expense effects are unhedged and when they are hedged with treasury share holdings. The results demonstrate that the expenses resulting from settlement-date accounting for equity share option awards are significantly higher on average than the expenses resulting from grant-date accounting. And they show that the cost of equity, the share price volatility and the lifetime of the equity share options are important determinants for the size of the differences in total expenses, which in a long run perspective is to be expected from the use of these two alternative accounting models for equity share options. The simulation results demonstrate that hedging with treasury share holdings is very effective to stabilize expenses resulting from options granted to employeesNo keywords;...|$|R
40|$|The UN Convention on {{the rights}} of the child speaks not only about needs but about the rights of {{children}} from the moment of a birth. The Convention covers a wide scale of the rights consolidated in three basic categories: - The right to life, - The right for survival and development, - The right for protection and participation. The Convention provisions assume that children should live in the environment providing for realization of their rights starting from the right for a name and citizenship and ending with the medical and sanitary care and education. They have the right to shelter from torture, exploitation, arbitrary detention, and unreasonable deprivation of family care. Children have the right to participate in decisions concerning their lives and to participate in the life of the local community. The Convention is not the hierarchy of the rights and therefore, one right cannot possible have a higher priority in comparison with the other right. The Convention demonstrates that all rights of the child are equally important. Rights complement each other and provide for survival and development of the child. The countries-signatories to the Convention make a commitment to respect and ensure the whole complex of rights stipulated by the Convention for each child within the limits of the state jurisdiction without any discrimination (UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 1989, ARTICLE 2 (1)). The state and the family are responsible for guaranteeing, respecting, and realizing the rights of the child. It is widely accepted that the state has a central and a primarily beneficial role in the protection of young people. Therefore, even if children experience extreme abuse or are neglect from their families the state authorities are supposed to provide comfort to those children. In the field of childhood studies there has been plentiful debate about the role of the state in children´s lives. Less attention is given to the ways in which the state is a source of risk for children (BOYDEN 2007, P. 240). The present research tries to show that with an effort to limit the influx of illegal migrants to their own countries many governments fail to realize their obligations towards migrant children. In many cases for reasons of national security they try to limit the rights of the child, putting at stake a notion of childhood as a life phase free from political blemish: in legal terms at least, children are the bearers of rights that cannot be compromised or alienated by circumstance. There are 192 countries of the world ratified the UN Convention {{on the rights}} of the child, including five Central Asian states. (ALSTON/TOBIN 2005, P. 10) Having joined the UN CRC, Central Asian countries have undertaken a wide range of obligations requiring serious revision of the current legislation, of the corresponding mechanisms for coordination of the child protection system and monitoring of the rights´ implementation. However, the UN Committee {{on the rights of}} the child in the concluding observations to periodic reports provided by the countries marks that there are still a number of problems in this area: - In countries of Central Asia the national legislation does not always fully comply with principles of the UN Convention {{on the rights of the}} child; - Lack of necessary financial and human resources, lack of the comprehensive approach in the child protection hinders the work of coordinating structures involved in the child rights protection (UNICEF INNOCENTI RESEARCH CENTER 2006, P. 31). - Lack of the statistical data on children, first of all, about the most vulnerable groups of children, hinders monitoring of the Convention implementation. Due to these existing problems the issues of children especially in need of assistance fall out of the focus of the governments. These children become «invisible» which means that the rights of these children will not be satisfied even at the level of basic needs such as sufficient nutrition, health care, school education and family care. The reasons causing such situations are lack of the data about children in the state agency of statistics, lack of the records about these children during development of the state program, duplication of functions of various departments and ministries. In 2006, countries of Central Asian initiated the Forum on child protection to overcome these problems. Issues of social policy, protection and inclusion of children, creation of the social protection system and overcoming of fragmentation were discussed. The Forum has demonstrated that it is an effective instrument for interstate cooperation and exchange of experience. Hereafter, it can serve as an impulse to conduct the integrated Forums (Forum on education, Forum on maternity and child health, Forum on child protection). The regional analysis of child protection systems shows that there is a fragmentation of the current child care systems. There is a multitude of actors, not necessarily well coordinated that have to respond to complex family situations and different child protection problems. Reforms of current child care systems into a continuum of services that provide individualized responses, rather than collectivist responses is one of the important regional lessons learned to strengthen the current system response. There are many implications for governments in this work: - They must be driving the vision for change and articulate operational plans, guiding principles for the reform as well as targets for the coming years. - Governments also need to be active in enforcing what are the core responsibilities of the state. This includes setting standards for the operation for the system, carry out gate-keeping functions, accreditation, provide support to planning, costing and budgeting at regional and local levels, defining the minimum package of services; and development of targeted social policies to support most vulnerable families - To overcome fragmentation and ensure proper coordination of the work, governments are also responsible for bridging gaps between sectors, coordination and facilitating institutional and professional capacity development. This includes regulate allocation of resources (decentralization with <b>equity),</b> define <b>obligations</b> of the different sectors (including responsibilities of the professionals encompassed in job descriptions), ensure continuum of services between the different actors (includes identifying missing services and functions) and improve professional competencies (job descriptions, training, lessons learned, sharing potential good practices, etc.) - Finally, governments need to take full responsibility for review of quality of services provided through monitoring of services (beyond financial monitoring), development of methods for result-based management, support to systems for data collection, provide opportunities for competition in service provision between state actors and NGOs. Having signed the UN Convention on the rights of the child, the governments of all Central Asian countries have undertaken to respect the rights of children, including the right to the proper standard of living. The governments of Central Asia should be aware of necessity to input funds in development of children because children are the future. Since 1998, the region enjoyed economic growth while the economic recession was left behind. Taking the economic growth into the account as well as reduction of the birth rate, today all Central Asian countries have a unique chance to invest in education and public health for the future of their children. In the long-term prospect these investments will allow the younger generation to make their own investment...|$|R
