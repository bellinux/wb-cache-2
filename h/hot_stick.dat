50|$|In the {{electric}} power distribution industry, a <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> is an insulated pole, usually made of fiberglass, used by electric utility workers when engaged on live-line working on energized high-voltage electric power lines, {{to protect them}} from electric shock. Depending on the tool attached {{to the end of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>stick,</b> it is possible to test for voltage, tighten nuts and bolts, apply tie wires (twisted lengths of ductile wire which fasten the running cable to its supporting insulators), open and close switches, replace fuses, lay insulating sleeves on wires, and perform various other tasks while not exposing the crew to a large risk of electric shock.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, ASTM Standard F 711 {{specifies}} the stringent {{requirements for}} <b>hot</b> <b>sticks,</b> and U.S. OSHA standards require {{that they be}} inspected and electrically tested every two years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>sticks</b> {{are used}} in live line work by having the worker remain at a {{specified}} distance from the live parts and carry out the work {{by means of an}} insulating stick. Tools can be attached to the stick, allowing work to be performed with the worker himself safely away from the live conductors.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{is always}} {{connected to the}} primary distribution lines through protective fuses and disconnect switches. For pole-mounted transformers this usually {{takes the form of}} a 'fused cutout'. An electrical fault causes the fuse to melt, and the device drops open to give a visual indication of trouble. It can also be manually opened while the line is energized by lineworkers using insulated <b>hot</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hot sticks {{are made}} in {{different}} lengths, from simple [...] sticks to [...] telescoping models. Because the fiberglass provides electrical insulation, the <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> allows utility workers to perform operations on power lines safely without de-energizing them or while {{the state of the}} power line is not yet known. This is essential because certain operations (such as opening or closing combination fuse/switches) must occasionally be performed on an energized line. Additionally, after a fault occurs, the exact state of a line may not be certain; in this case, for reasons of crew safety, the utility workers must treat the line as though it were energized until it can be proven that it is not and safety ground cables {{can be applied to the}} line (so that the line is guaranteed to remain grounded/earthed while maintenance is performed upon it). If power tools are fitted to the end of the <b>hot</b> <b>stick,</b> they are usually powered hydraulically rather than electrically because, like the fiberglass of the <b>hot</b> <b>stick,</b> the hydraulic fluid is also a good insulator. The hydraulic power is commonly supplied from the bucket truck (cherry picker or aerial work platform) supporting the workers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> {{not only}} {{electrically}} insulates the worker from the energized conductor, it provides physical {{separation from the}} device being operated, to reduce the chances of burns which might result from electrical arcing {{if there is a}} malfunction of the device being operated.|$|E
5000|$|Pad-mounted {{transformers}} {{are made}} in power ratings from around 75 to around 5000 kVA and often include built-in fuses and switches. Primary power cables may be connected with elbow connectors, which can be operated when energized using a <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> and allows for flexibility in repair and maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{lubrication}} may {{be provided}} to the drum surface from on-board [...] "sprinkler tanks" [...] to prevent <b>hot</b> asphalt <b>sticking</b> to the drum.|$|R
50|$|When {{working with}} {{energized}} power lines, linemen must use protection to eliminate {{any contact with}} the energized line. The requirements for PPEs and associated permissible voltage depends on applicable regulations in jurisdiction as well as company policy. Voltages higher than those that can be worked using gloves are worked with special sticks known as hot-line tools or <b>hot</b> <b>sticks,</b> with which power lines can be safely handled from a distance. Linemen must also wear special rubber insulating gear when working with live wires to protect against any accidental contact with the wire. The buckets linemen sometimes work from are also insulated with fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|Boom Boom is a posing character, a shapely blonde that [...] "helps" [...] Dorf {{out when}} he's {{explaining}} the [...] "dog-leg" [...] hole. She annoys Dorf when her <b>hot</b> dog <b>sticks</b> to his stick {{and when she}} drops an illustration because she's fixing her hair.|$|R
50|$|When {{the work}} is completed, the process is {{reversed}} to remove the worker safely from the wire. Barehand working provides the lineman with greater dexterity than the <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> method, and may be the preferred option if conditions permit it. With this technique, insulator strings, conductor spacers and vibration dampers can be replaced, or lines spliced, without any loss of supply.|$|E
5000|$|The fuse holder, {{also called}} the [...] "fuse tube" [...] or [...] "door", an {{insulating}} tube which contains the replaceable fuse element. When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the fuse holder drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging fuse holder provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the fuse holder using a <b>hot</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Each {{fuse holder}} {{typically}} has an attached pull ring {{that can be}} engaged by a hook {{at the end of}} a fiberglass <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a bucket truck, to manually open the switch. While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load. For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a [...] "load break" [...] version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.|$|E
50|$|Hot melt {{adhesives}} (such as <b>hot</b> glue <b>sticks)</b> and top of {{the line}} soccer cleats are usually made from EVA, usually with additives like wax and resin. EVA is also used as a clinginess-enhancing additive in plastic wraps. Craft foam sheets are made of EVA and are popularly used for children's foam stickers.|$|R
5000|$|Although he crafted other things, Wara {{was best}} known for his wooden sculptures ( [...] in Pitjantjatjara). He carved them by hand and burned designs into them with a <b>hot</b> wire <b>stick</b> (this is called pyrography). His sculptures are of the perentie lizard, a type of goanna from central Australia which is also Wara's totem.|$|R
50|$|Brik pastry (malsouqa or warka) {{is made by}} {{slapping}} {{a sticky}} lump of dough onto a <b>hot</b> non <b>stick</b> surface in overlapping circles to produce the desired size and cooked {{for a minute or}} two. Typical fillings include tuna, ground meat, chopped boiled egg, chicken, shrimp, or anchovies garnished with a fried egg and harissa, capers, or cheese.|$|R
5000|$|Vibrations in {{the main}} cable were passed down through the clamp and into the shorter damper, or [...] "messenger", cable. This would flex and cause the symmetrically-placed {{concrete}} blocks at its ends to oscillate. Careful choice {{of the mass of}} the blocks, and the stiffness and length of the damper cable would match the mechanical impedance of the damper to that of the line, and greatly attenuate oscillation of the main cable. Since Stockbridge dampers were economical, effective and easy to install, they became used routinely on overhead lines. Live-line working using <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> tools meant it was possible to retrofit dampers to lines while energised.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{technique}} of glassblowing {{had not yet been}} invented, its creation was a complicated process. The vase was made from two pieces: the widely flaring belly on a high foot, and the shoulder with a long neck and flaring mouth. These two pieces fit together exactly. The join is covered by a gilt copper strip decorated with vine patterns. Only one side of this strip survives, however. The two parts were made in turn. The belly, whose walls are very thin, was either cast in a mould or pressed onto a mould. The bell-shaped foot was produced similarly, which was then hot joined to the belly piece using a solid stick. The other portion was made in the same way. The shoulder and a portion of the neck were either cast in a mould or lowered onto a template while hot. The rest of the neck and the mouth were melted together with a <b>hot</b> <b>stick,</b> just as the foot and belly were. Because of the bulge, the join can easily be spotted.|$|E
5000|$|Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye ("Y" [...] on {{electrical}} schematics) or delta (Greek letter [...] "Δ" [...] on electrical schematics). A delta system {{requires only}} a conductor {{for each of}} the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the neutral, whose source is the center of the [...] "Y" [...] and is grounded. However, [...] "spur lines" [...] branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a service drop, there is a pole-mounted step-down transformer to provide the required mains voltage. In North America, service drops provide 240/120V split-phase power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers. In Europe and most other countries, 230V three phase (230Y400) service drops are used. The transformer's primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called fuse cutouts. In the event of an overload, the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> to disconnect the transformer from the line.|$|E
50|$|If the {{material}} thrown out cools too rapidly, and becomes denser than the air, it cannot rise as high, and suddenly collapses {{back to the}} ground, forming a pyroclastic flow, hitting the surface like water from a waterfall, and spreading sideways across the land at enormous speed. When the pumice and ash settles, it is sufficiently <b>hot</b> to <b>stick</b> together as a rock called Ignimbrite. Pyroclastic flows can travel hundreds of kilometres an hour.|$|R
50|$|With {{other types}} of pans, some oil or fat is {{required}} to prevent <b>hot</b> food from <b>sticking</b> to the pan's surface. Food {{does not have the}} same tendency to stick to a non-stick surface; pans can be used with less, or no, oil, and are easier to clean, as residues do not stick to the surface.|$|R
50|$|Today, HMA (hot-melt adhesives) are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} different types, allowing for use {{in a wide range of}} applications across several industries. For use with hobby or craft projects such as the assembly or repair of remote control foam model aircraft, and artificial floral arrangements, hot-melt sticks and hot-melt glue guns are used in the application of the adhesive. For use in industrial processes, adhesive is supplied in larger sticks and glue guns with higher melting rates. Aside from <b>hot</b> melt <b>sticks,</b> HMA can be delivered in other formats such at granular or power hot melt blocks for bulk melt processors. Larger applications of HMA traditionally use pneumatic systems to supply adhesive.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{automotive}} historians {{say that}} the term originated with stolen vehicles being refitted with another engine and repainted. In {{the early days of}} automobile manufacturing there was no identical matching transmission, body frame, and engine numbers. It was possible to change engines and repaint the car or truck and in effect turn it into a different vehicle and thus it became near impossible to prove that the vehicle was stolen. The term [...] "hot" [...] was equivalent to being stolen. The term [...] "rod" [...] was equivalent to any motorized vehicle. Even today, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment in its vehicle emissions regulations, refers to a [...] "hotrod" [...] as any motorized vehicle that has a replacement engine differing from the factory original. Another possible origin includes replacement of the camshaft with a new ("hotter") version, sometimes known as a <b>hot</b> <b>stick</b> or hot rod. Roadsters were the cars of choice because they were light, easy to modify, and inexpensive. The term became commonplace in the 1930s or 1940s as the name of a car that had been [...] "hopped up" [...] by modifying the engine for higher performance. A term common in the early days was [...] "gow job". This has fallen into disuse except with historians.|$|E
50|$|The piston {{might be}} a fairly loose fit in the cylinder. If it were a tight fit, it would expand as it got <b>hot</b> and might <b>stick</b> tight in the cylinder. If a piston sticks (seizes) it could cause serious damage to the engine. On the other hand, if {{there is too much}} {{clearance}} between the piston and cylinder walls, much of the pressure from the burning gasoline vapour will leak past the piston (a condition known as blow-by) and into the crankcase, and the push on the piston from combustion will be much less effective in delivering power.|$|R
50|$|Its {{signature}} {{foods are}} <b>hot</b> dogs on <b>sticks</b> and lemonade fresh made to order. Although {{commonly referred to}} as corn dogs, the employee manual claims that the item is actually known as a Hot Dog on a Stick, with the reasoning that corn dogs are frozen and reheated, while these are made fresh to order. The lemonade is made fresh at least every two hours and is available in original flavor, cherry, lime, blue raspberry and frozen in all flavors. The menu selections include hot dogs, American and pepper jack cheese on a stick, veggie dogs on a stick, French fries, funnel cake sticks, and at a few locations, fish and zucchini in a tempura batter. According to the corporate website, Hot Dog on a Stick uses only turkey in its signature hot dogs on a stick, but also offers Nathan's Beef dogs.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy," [...] said Lanigan, [...] "I cannot put {{the facts}} {{into the hands}} of a woman. No matter how noble or honorable she may be, without the least {{intention}} on her part they would leak out, and if Calthea Rose should get hold of them I should be lost. She'd drop old Tippengray like a <b>hot</b> potato and <b>stick</b> to me like one of those adhesive plasters that have holes in them. No, sir; I don't want Calthea Rose to think well of me. I want her to keep on considering me as a good-for-nothing scapegrace, and, by George! it's easy enough to make her do that. It's all in her line of business. But I want other people to think well of me in a general way, and when Calthea and Tippengray have settled things between them, and are traveling on the Continent, which they certainly ought to do, I'll start in business, and take my place as one of the leading citizens of Lethbury; and, as things look now, all will be plain sailing if Mrs. Cristie thinks well enough of me not to interfere between me and Ida Mayberry. Now all I ask of you is to say a good word for me if you can get a chance." ...|$|R
50|$|In the ballad, {{a farmer}} loses a bet with a giant, called Skrymir in some verses, who demands his son. The farmer asks first Odin, then Hœnir, and finally Loki for assistance. Odin has {{a field of}} grain grow up {{overnight}} and conceals the boy as one grain on an axe {{in the middle of}} the field. The boy is afraid because the giant's hand is brushing against the particular grain, but Odin calls him to him and returns him to his parents, telling them he has fulfilled the task. Hœnir causes seven swans to fly over the sound; the boy is a feather in the middle of a swan's head. But the giant grabs one swan and wrenches its head from its body, and the boy is afraid because the particular feather is protruding from the giant's mouth. Hœnir calls him to him and brings him back, and his work is over. Loki instructs the farmer to build a boathouse with a wide opening and to affix an iron stake to it. Then he goes to the beach, where a boat is riding at anchor, rows out to sea, casts a weighted hook to the bottom, and catches a flounder. He has the boy be a grain {{in the middle of the}} fish's roe. The giant is waiting on the beach for Loki, asking him where he has been all night. He tells him he has had little rest, rowing all about the sea, and they go out together to fish. The giant casts his line and catches three flounders; the third is black, and Loki asks him to give him that fish. The giant refuses, and begins to count the roe, thinking to find the boy in one grain. The boy is afraid, because the particular grain is squeezing out of the giant's hand. Loki calls him to him and tells him to sit behind him and not let the giant see him and when they reach shore, to jump onto the beach so lightly that he does not make a mark in the sand. As the giant is pulling the boat onto the land, the boy jumps out and is standing before him; the giant pursues him but sinks in the sand up to his knees. The boy runs as fast as he can into his father's boathouse; the giant, in <b>hot</b> pursuit, <b>sticks</b> fast in the opening; the iron stake goes into his head. Loki cuts off one of his legs, but the wound grows together at once; he cuts off the other, this time throwing sticks and stones into the gap, and the wound does not grow together. Loki takes the boy home to his parents and says that he has done the job asked of him; the giant is dead.|$|R
