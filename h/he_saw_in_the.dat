5|$|Concurrent {{with these}} events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) {{continues}} {{to visit the}} amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pictures. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods {{that led him to}} the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on {{the popularity of the}} film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game. Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into {{a false sense of security}} by the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of Pac-Man, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.|$|E
5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E

25|$|William Trevore (Trevor): A Mayflower seaman who {{was hired}} to remain in Plymouth for one year. One reason for his hiring was his prior New World experience. He {{was one of those}} seamen to crew the shallop used in coastal trading. He {{returned}} to England with _____ Ely and others on the Fortune in December 1621. In 1623, Robert Cushman noted that Trevor reported to the Adventurers about what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New World. He did at some time return as master of a ship and was recorded living in Massachusetts Bay Colony in April 1650.|$|E
25|$|The unrest reached {{new heights}} of {{violence}} after the drastic {{reduction of the}} work force during the Great Depression. Indian peasants continued to rebel in the countryside, although they had been disarmed and their leaders had been executed after participating in the overthrow of the Conservative Party in 1899. Now, for the first time, the Indians found support for their cause among the elite. Gustavo Navarro, who took the name Tristan Marof, was Bolivia's most important Indianist. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inca past the first successful socialism and the model to solve rural problems. As Indian uprisings continued during the Liberal rule, Siles Reyes promised to improve their situation and organized the National Crusade in Favor of Indians.|$|E

25|$|Details of Poussin's artistic {{training}} are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 {{he traveled to}} Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially Raphael, who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as The Death of Germanicus, The Massacre of the Innocents, and {{the first of his}} two series of the Seven Sacraments.|$|E
25|$|Lange was {{on several}} {{occasions}} visited by South Africans in Norway, both friends of Norwegian ancestry and people with central positions in the country, including General Charles Edward More. Lange and his wife Karin visited the country in early 1972 for three weeks, the trip having been arranged by long-time family friend Major John M. Gray. Their flight was welcomed by government representatives at an airport 50 kilometers outside Pretoria, and he met with prominent figures such {{as head of the}} Department of Information Eschel Rhoodie. He also met the leader of the Progressive Party, a party Lange praised for being the purest capitalist party in the world. He was also impressed with what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, including the Bantu chiefs he met. Lange also advocated that Norway should recognize Ian Smith's Rhodesia, an internationally unrecognized state. He wrote to Smith that Anders Langes Avis was the only paper in Norway that consistently supported his regime and sent issues of his paper to the Rhodesian Department of External Services. In response his paper received greetings and thanks from Smith and Rhodesian government officials.|$|E
25|$|Though {{few in the}} new {{congress}} wanted to debate a possible Bill of Rights (for the next century, most thought that the Declaration of Independence, not the first ten constitutional amendments, constituted the true Bill of Rights), Madison pressed the issue. Congress was busy setting up the new government, most wanted {{to wait for the}} system to show its defects before amending the constitution, and the anti-federalist movements (which had demanded a new convention) had died out quickly once the constitution was ratified. Despite this, Madison still feared that the states would compel congress to call for a new constitutional convention, which they had the right to do. He also believed that the constitution did not sufficiently protect the national government from excessive democracy and parochialism (the defects <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state governments), so he saw the amendments as mitigation of these problems. On June 8, 1789, Madison introduced his bill proposing amendments consisting of Nine Articles comprising up to 20 potential amendments. Madison initially proposed that the amendments be incorporated into the body of the Constitution. The House passed most of the amendments, but rejected the idea of placing them {{in the body of the}} Constitution. Instead, it adopted 17 amendments to be attached separately and sent this bill to the Senate.|$|E
