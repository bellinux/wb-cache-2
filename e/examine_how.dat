Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L.

5|$|In 1360 {{the king}} {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} Southampton's defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> best to improve them. The commission came {{to a number of}} conclusions: the town walls should be better maintained and kept clear of housing and other obstructions; the number of gateways in the walls should be reduced; and a water-filled ditch should be built to further reinforce the walls on the west. The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line.|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have developed many programming environments for children. Typically {{each of these}} environments contains its own programming notation ranging from computer code to animated virtual 3 D robots and in some case the notation consists of physical objects. While some of these notations were created by <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> children naturally describe computer programs, little research has <b>examined</b> <b>how</b> children understand programs written using these notations. Even less research has <b>examined</b> <b>how</b> children understand programs written using multiple notations...|$|R

5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has {{proposed}} to MDOT that I-475 should {{be connected to}} US23 {{in the southern part}} of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The study will also <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E

The FIR will enable detailed study of how liquids behave in microgravity, a crucial detail for many chemical reactions. One experiment, for instance, will <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> mixtures known as colloids behave without being stirred by sedimentation and convection.

For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).|$|E
