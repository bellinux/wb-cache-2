5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, {{author of the book}} Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> improving travel times. The {{study concluded that}} {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} body of data {{reveals a}} one-to-one linear correlation between galaxy halo mass {{and the total}} mass in its globular cluster (GC) population, M_GCS M_h^ 1. 03 ± 0. 03, valid over 5 orders of magnitude. We explore {{the nature of this}} correlation for galaxies of different morphological types, and for the subpopulations of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) GCs. For the subpopulations of different metallicity we find M_GCS(blue) M_h^ 0. 96 ± 0. 03 and M_GCS(red) M_h^ 1. 21 ± 0. 03 with similar scatter. The numerical values of these exponents can be derived from the detailed behavior of the red and blue GC fractions with galaxy mass and provide a self-consistent set of relations. In addition, all morphological types (E, S 0, S/Irr) follow the same relation, but with a second-order trend for spiral galaxies to have a slightly higher fraction of metal-rich GCs for a given mass. These results suggest that the amount of gas available for GC formation at high redshift was <b>in</b> nearly <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the dark-matter halo potential, in strong contrast to the markedly nonlinear behavior of total stellar mass versus halo mass. Of the few available theoretical treatments that directly discuss the formation of GCs in a hierarchical merging framework,the model of Kravtsov & Gnedin (2005) best matches these observations.

As for the comparative effects of the 15 % chick-embryo extracts against the 20 % diluted solution from the sediment, the former surpasses the latter in every respects, namely, in the relative tissue growth rate, the wandering velocity of pseudoeosinophils and the lowness in the appearance of regressively degenerated granules.

Three regulators of transcription are central to WAT browning and serve as targets for many of the molecules known to influence this process. These include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). The list of molecules that influence browning has grown <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the popularity of this topic and is constantly evolving as more knowledge is acquired. Among these molecules are irisin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which have been well-studied and are believed to be important regulators of browning. Irisin is secreted from muscle in response to exercise and has been shown to increase browning by acting on beige preadipocytes. FGF21, a hormone secreted mainly by the liver, has garnered a great deal of interest after being identified as a potent stimulator of glucose uptake and a browning regulator through its effects on PGC-1α. It is increased in BAT during cold exposure and is thought to aid in resistance to diet-induced obesity FGF21 may also be secreted in response to exercise and a low protein diet, although the latter has not been thoroughly investigated. Data from these studies suggest that environmental factors like diet and exercise may be important mediators of browning.|$|E

Native tussock species once established in the protection of other low-growing species might persist and provide stability over a longer period. This paper describes the early results achieved on two sites in the Canterbury mountains, through sowing seed of four tussock species under five cover treatments. Sowing of seed of Notodanthonia setifolia produced very few seedlings but blue tussock, hard tussock and Gilver tussock gave reasonable results. Highest emergence was recorded under the least cover on the control plots, and there was, in general, an inverse relationship between cover treatment density and emergence of tussock seedlings. Survival of tussc<~k seedlings over the first eighteen months from sowing was, hQwever, <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> positive <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the amount of cover present.

We develop analytical models of the bowing of a pinned dislocation segment as well as numerical simulations of three dimensional dislocation dynamics. We find that the strain rate has a direct influence on both the activation time and the source strength of Frank–Read sources at strain rates up to 106 s− 1, and the source strength increases <b>in</b> almost <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the strain rate.

Above 106 s− 1, the speed of the bowing segments reaches values that exceed the domain of validity of the linear viscous drag law, and the drag law is modified to account for inertial effects on the motion of the dislocation. As a result the activation times of Frank–Read sources reach a finite limit at strain rates greater than 108 s− 1, suggesting that Frank–Read sources are unable to operate before homogeneous nucleation relaxes elastic stresses at the higher strain rates of shock loading. Elastodynamic calculations are carried out to compare the contributions of Frank–Read sources and homogeneous nucleation of dislocations to plastic relaxation.

Correlating these two sets of data, {{we find that the}} mass ratio η ≡ MGCS/Mh (total mass in globular clusters, divided by halo mass) is essentially constant at 〈η 〉 ∼ 4 × 10 − 5, strongly confirming earlier suggestions in the literature. Globular clusters are the only known stellar population that formed <b>in</b> essentially <b>direct</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> host galaxy halo mass. The intrinsic scatter in η appears to be at most 0. 2 dex; we argue that some of this scatter is due to differing degrees of tidal stripping of the globular cluster systems between central and satellite galaxies. We suggest that this correlation can be understood if most globular clusters form at very early stages in galaxy evolution, largely avoiding the feedback processes that inhibited the bulk of field-star formation in their host galaxies. The actual mean value of η also suggests that about 1 / 4 of the initial gas mass present in protogalaxies collected into GMCs large enough to form massive, dense star clusters. Finally, our calibration of 〈η 〉 indicates that the halo masses of the Milky Way and M 31 are (1. 2 ± 0. 5) × 1012 M and (3. 9 ± 1. 8) × 1012 M respectively...|$|R
