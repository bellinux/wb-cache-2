The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an electrically-energized device for the rapid {{generation of steam}} or other vapors. The high-speed steam generator includes a wicked evaporator, a liquid reservoir, a liquid supply pipe, and a vapor transport tube. The evaporator consists of a low-thermal-conductivity porous wick, heated from a downward-facing grooved <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> that is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the wick structure. The grooved <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> is made of a copper block in which electric cartridge heaters are installed. As a heat load is applied on the <b>heating</b> <b>block,</b> an extremely steep temperature gradient is established immediately at the upper surface of the wick so that water from the saturated wick evaporates rapidly adjacent to the heated surface. Subsequently, menisci are formed at the vapor/liquid interface to develop a capillary force to pump subcooled liquid into the wick from the liquid reservoir. A plurality of grooves in the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> allow the resulting vapor to instantaneously escape from the heated surface so that a high heat transfer rate from the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> to the saturated wick can be maintained at all time...|$|E

Two aluminized polymeric fabrics (Norfab 11 HT- 26 -A and Preox 1100 - 4) and one neoprene type material in two thicknesses (Vonar 2 and 3) were tested as <b>heat</b> <b>blocking</b> layers to protect the urethane foam from rapid heat degradation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Melting {{temperature}} {{analysis of}} products amplified with SYBR I Green chemistry is a cheap and effective method for identification of sequence differences. When used in conventional quantitative real-time PCR instruments (qPCR), {{this method is}} limited by temperature variations over the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> and low numbers of fluorescence measurements during the dissociation step, which hamper the ability of most instruments to report accurate and precise melting temperatures. METHODS: We designed a molecular beacon-based temperature indicator probe (Tm-probe) to control for variations in temperatures over the <b>heating</b> <b>block</b> of the instrument. In addition, we wrote an automated curve-fit analysis algorithm of dissociation data to use multiple data points with a gaussian curve fit to extrapolate precise melting temperatures. RESULTS: Use of the Tm-probe {{in conjunction with the}} analysis algorithm and multiple dissociations improved SDs of melting temperatures over a 96 -well plate from 0. 19 to 0. 06 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Melting temperature analyses with SYBR I Green chemistry on conventional qPCR instruments can be improved by the use of a Tm-probe in conjunction with curve-fit analysis of data.

40|$|Short-term heating of {{softwood}} veneer blocks temporarily softens {{the wood}} {{so that it}} can be peeled more readily. Heating reduces the depth of lathe checks and the likelihood of splitting and thereby increases the quality and quantity of veneer recovered. The softwood-plywood industry conventionally conditions blocks three ways: steaming blocks in drive-in chambers, deluging blocks in such chambers with hot water, or submerging blocks in feed-through vats of hot water.
