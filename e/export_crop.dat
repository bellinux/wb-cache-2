Given the problem of selectivity bias that arise when households self-select into <b>export</b> <b>cropping,</b> we employ the full information maximum likelihood approach to analyze the participation decision, and generalized propensity matching approach to examine the welfare impacts of participation. The empirical results indicate that farmers facing lower transport costs and having better access to credit facilities are more likely to participate in <b>export</b> <b>cropping.</b> Estimates of the welfare impacts of <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> generally reveal a positive relationship between engagement in <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> and farm household welfare. However, a consideration of the impact of extent of <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> shows a non-linear relationship with household welfare indicators, with per capita expenditures rising and poverty declining only at higher levels of <b>export</b> specialization. <b>Export</b> <b>crops,</b> Farm households, Household welfare, Poverty, Generalized propensity score, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of export costs {{in the process of}} poverty {{reduction}} in rural Africa. The authors claim that the marketing costs that emerge when the commercialization of <b>export</b> <b>crops</b> requires intermediaries can lead to lower participation into <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> and, thus, to higher poverty. They test the model using data from the Uganda National Household Survey. The findings show that: i) farmers living in villages with fewer outlets for sales of agricultural exports are likely to be poorer than farmers residing in marketendowed villages; ii) market availability leads to increased household participation in <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> (coffee, tea, cotton, fruits); and iii) households engaged in <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> {{are less likely to be}} poor than subsistence-based households. The authors conclude that the availability of markets for agricultural <b>export</b> <b>crops</b> helps realize the gains from trade. This result uncovers {{the role of}} complementary factors that provide market access and reduce marketing costs as key building blocks in the link between the gains from export opportunities and the poor.

25|$|In North America indigo was {{introduced}} into colonial South Carolina by Eliza Lucas Pinckney, where {{it became the}} colony's second-most important cash crop (after rice). As a major <b>export</b> <b>crop,</b> indigo supported plantation slavery there. When Benjamin Franklin sailed to France in November 1776 to enlist France's support for the American Revolutionary War, 35 barrels of indigo were on board the Reprisal, the sale of which would help fund the war effort. In colonial North America, three commercially important species are found: the native I. caroliniana, and the introduced I. tinctoria and I. suffruticosa.|$|E
25|$|Papua New Guinea is richly {{endowed with}} natural resources, {{including}} mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine (including {{a large portion}} of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain — including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands — and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. Oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major <b>export</b> <b>crop</b> (produced largely in the Highlands provinces), followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders and tea, produced on estates and rubber. The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt.|$|E

The Sahel region also contains other major producers such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal and Mali. Niger is the main exporter of cowpeas and Nigeria the main importer. Exact figures for cowpea production {{are hard to come}} up with as it is not a major <b>export</b> <b>crop.</b> A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on [...] and have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes.

500|$|Vanilla {{was first}} {{introduced}} to French Polynesia by French colonizers as an <b>export</b> <b>crop.</b> Later, it became an important cash crop {{in the development of}} the island's economy. In the early 20th century, production was much greater than it is today, with 150-200 tons produced annually and plantations employing a sizable percentage of the population. Over the years, its production has been influenced by several factors and has declined from a high of 200 tons to a 2013 yield of 60 tons. The largest concentration of the vanilla variety Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla) is situated in the Society Islands. The island of Taha'a, known as the [...] "Vanilla Island" [...] because of its pervasive aroma of vanilla, produces about 80% of all French Polynesia's vanilla.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{acquired}} {{the power to}} negotiate with the Imam and the tribesmen, Wingate needed to reassert the power of the Sultanate and find some leverage to force the Imam into negotiations. [...] He began by collecting unpaid customs duties in order to raise more revenue for the Sultan, and sent emissaries to Isa Bin Salih, the Imam's chief deputy. [...] Wingate's initial overtures proved unsuccessful, so he threatened to impose a [...] "punitive tax" [...] on dates, the chief <b>export</b> <b>crop</b> of Oman. [...] Because the Sultan controlled the ports and coastal areas, he had the power to collect such a tax, which would have ruined the Omani farmers. After the imposition of the tax, riots erupted in the interior, and the Imam was murdered by angry farmers.

40|$|We {{explore how}} globalization, broadly {{conceived}} to include international humanrights norms, humanitarianism, and alternative trade, might influence peaceful and foodsecure outlooks and outcomes. The paper draws on our previous work on conflict {{as a cause}} and effect of hunger and also looks at agricultural exports as war commodities. We review studies on the relationships between (1) conflict and food insecurity, (2) conflict and globalization, and (3) globalization and food insecurity. Next, we analyze countrylevel, historical contexts where <b>export</b> <b>crops,</b> such as coffee and cotton, have been implicated in triggering and perpetuating conflict. These cases {{suggest that it is}} not <b>export</b> <b>cropping</b> per se, but production and trade structures and food and financial policy contexts that determine peaceful or belligerent outcomes. <b>Export</b> <b>cropping</b> appears to contribute to conflict when fluctuating prices destabilize household and national incomes and when revenues fund hostilities. Also, in these scenarios, governments have not taken steps to progressively realize the right to adequate food or to reduce hunger and poverty. We conclude by exploring implications for agricultural development, trade, and human rights policies.
