5|$|Armed {{with the}} canal company's specifications, Samuel ordered three tankers from William Gray & Company in {{northern}} England. Named , Conch and Clam, {{each had a}} capacity of 5,010long tons of <b>deadweight.</b> These three ships were the first tankers of the Tank Syndicate, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.|$|E
5|$|The American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, {{shortly after}} its March 1899 formation, placed orders {{for its first}} four ships for the company's planned sugar service between Hawaii and the East Coast of the United States. Three ships—American, , and —were ordered from Delaware River Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania, while the fourth——was ordered from Union Iron Works of San Francisco. The {{contract}} cost of the three Pennsylvania-built ships was set at $425,000 each, but financing costs drove the final cost of each ship higher; the final cost of American was $61.00 per <b>deadweight</b> ton, which totaled just under $540,000.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of <b>deadweight</b> tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E

5|$|In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships— and Ohioan. The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed {{for some of the}} nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Ohioan, including financing costs, was $73.58 per <b>deadweight</b> ton, which came out to just under $730,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—Kentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The {{contract}} for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of Kentuckian, including financing costs, was $58.33 per <b>deadweight</b> ton, which came out to just under $579,000.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{practice}} of flagging ships {{in foreign countries}} began in the 1920s in the United States when shipowners, frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs, began to register their ships to Panama. The use of open registries steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest shipping register. , {{more than half of}} the world’s merchant ships were registered with open registries, and the Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands flags accounted for almost 40% of the entire world fleet, in terms of <b>deadweight</b> tonnage. In 2006 up to 20% of high-seas fishing vessels were registered in states they were not connected to.|$|E

5|$|Today, bulkers make up 15% - 17% of the world's {{merchant}} fleets {{and range}} in size from single-hold mini-bulkers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000metric tons of <b>deadweight</b> (DWT). A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it is loaded. Over half of all bulkers have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of bulkers, and 82% of these ships were built in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million <b>deadweight</b> tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Deadweights</b> is {{the second}} album from American punk rock band The <b>Deadweights.</b> The album was {{released}} in June 1983 on Slash Records, and was produced by the band and Shawn Coleri, Jr. The album is often seen as a weaker effort than its predecessor and successors. The album {{is made up of}} mostly short, fast punk songs, with two longer, experimental songs ("With the Dregs of the City" [...] and [...] "1984's Next Year"). [...] "Dumb as You" [...] was released as a single in support of the album. The album was re-released in 1990 on CD.|$|R

25|$|One economist's {{analysis}} calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a <b>deadweight</b> loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, {{because of}} the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion <b>deadweight</b> loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other <b>deadweight</b> losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.|$|E
25|$|The Valemax size ships, all ordered for Vale, have a <b>deadweight</b> of {{just over}} 400,000 tonnes and the Chinese {{government}} probably considers them too large to enter Chinese ports. Because of that the ships are now slimmed down to 380,000 tonnes <b>deadweight,</b> although it seems that this is only on paper: nothing has changed to the design but it would mean that ships to China cannot be loaded to capacity.|$|E
25|$|Nominally {{a vessel}} of 8,800 <b>deadweight</b> tons, West Loquassuck {{is listed in}} mercantile records as having a <b>deadweight</b> tonnage of 8,578 and a gross {{register}} tonnage of 5,644. The ship had an overall length of 423 feet 9inches, a beam of 54 feet and a draft of 24 feet 2inches. West Loquassuck was powered by a Curtis geared steam turbine driving a single screw propeller, delivering a service speed of 11.5 knots.|$|E

25|$|Most governments take revenue which {{exceeds that}} {{which can be}} {{provided}} by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least <b>deadweight</b> costs, or to give the best outcomes {{in terms of social}} welfare. The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing <b>deadweight</b> costs. Because <b>deadweight</b> costs are related to the elasticity of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall <b>deadweight</b> costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function, which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. If individuals experience diminishing returns from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.|$|E
25|$|Valemax {{ships are}} {{a fleet of}} very large ore {{carriers}} (VLOC) owned or chartered by the Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. to carry iron ore from Brazil to European and Asian ports. With a capacity ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 tons <b>deadweight,</b> the vessels meet the Chinamax standard of ship measurements for limits on draft and beam. Valemax ships are the largest bulk carriers ever constructed, when measuring <b>deadweight</b> tonnage or length overall, and are amongst the longest ships of any type currently in service.|$|E
25|$|Ship {{displacement}} {{should not}} be confused with measurements of volume or capacity typically used for commercial vessels, such as net tonnage, gross tonnage, or <b>deadweight</b> tonnage.|$|E
2500|$|Three <b>deadweights</b> in the {{south-west}} of {{the rock}} were laid down, to dock the boat nearby during [...] and ebb tides. A mooring buoy floated {{a short distance from}} the steamboat. The steamer anchored at nearby Cap Sizun stood ready to intervene at the slightest signal if the spring tides rose too high.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Deadweights</b> {{began when}} James [...] "White Jimmy" [...] White and Eddie Urland left their prior bands. The two soon joined with {{numerous}} local punk musicians. Early members included both Raymond Pettibon and future Xes bassist Hank Leary. Eventually, Dean [...] "Dopey" [...] Haydenbaugh and Richard [...] "Ricky Scaggs" [...] Scaglione {{would become the}} permanent drummer and bassist respectively. Originally using the name [...] "Deadwaves", the band eventually settled on The <b>Deadweights</b> {{by the end of}} 1978. They began appearing regularly at local NYC clubs, most notably CBGB. In 1980 they were offered a recording contract from Sire Records but rejected it. The band independently released two singles in the following months, [...] "Hostility" [...] and [...] "Dropping Neurotoxins", which would only increase attention toward the band. Eventually they signed with Slash Records, after they allowed the band creative freedom, and began work on their full-length debut album.|$|R
25|$|Anchorages are constructed, {{usually in}} tandem with the towers, to resist the tension of the cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually {{anchored}} in good quality rock, but may consist of massive reinforced concrete <b>deadweights</b> within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open eyebolts enclosed within a secure space.|$|R
25|$|Most taxes—including {{income tax}} and sales tax—can have {{significant}} <b>deadweight</b> costs. The {{only way to}} avoid <b>deadweight</b> costs in {{an economy that is}} generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change economic incentives. Such taxes include the land value tax, where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply, a lump sum tax such as a poll tax (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices. Arguably a windfall profits tax which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category.|$|E
25|$|Most taxes (see below) have {{side effects}} that reduce {{economic}} welfare, either by mandating unproductive labor (compliance costs) or by creating distortions to economic incentives (<b>deadweight</b> loss and perverse incentives).|$|E
25|$|Megantic had a {{gross tonnage}} of 14,878 and a net of 9,183 tons. The <b>deadweight</b> was 8,790 tons and load {{displacement}} on {{a draft of}} 27ft. 6 in. was 20,470 tons. The overall length was about 570ft.|$|E
50|$|First Wave Complete Destruction is {{the debut}} album from punk rock band The <b>Deadweights,</b> {{released}} in May 1981 on Slash Records. The album's title is {{a reference to}} the 5 mile radius of an atomic bomb's explosion. The cover is a photo taken of the July 1946 atomic test, Operation Crossroads Baker, at Bikini Atoll.

40|$|Two {{sides of}} the debate on Indonesia's future turn on the tension between {{sustained}} economic growth fueled by demand for Indonesia's natural resources and the highly skewed distribution of wealth. With the Indonesia boosters forecasting a vertiginous rise of Southeast Asia's largest economy, the naysayers point to the <b>deadweights</b> of corruption, lack of transparency, and poor governance. With democratic electoralism revived in a post-authoritarian setting, such issues can no longer be swept under the carpet: they are matched by a relatively openmedia and burgeoning civil society...|$|R
50|$|James White {{was born}} in New York City to an Italian father and Irish/British mother. He {{grew up in a}} mixed neighborhood, but went to the public schools which were mostly African Americans, and gained the {{nickname}} White Jimmy there. He never took it as racist, and has used it as a moniker his entire life since then. In the 1970s, he became a fan of proto punk band New York Dolls, and seminal punk band The Ramones, and began singing in a punk rock band. In 1978, he and Eddie Urland formed The <b>Deadweights.</b>|$|R
