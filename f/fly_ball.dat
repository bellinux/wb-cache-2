5|$|Trent Durrington {{became the}} only Australian {{position}} player to pitch in an MLB game when he appeared for the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 April 2004 against the Houston Astros. Durrington had already entered the game initially as a pinch hitter and remained in the game playing at third base. With two outs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning, Durrington faced one hitter and induced a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> out.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E

50|$|At {{one point}} during his youth, Bostock's {{baseball}} glove was stolen. With his mother unable to afford to purchase another, he had to use a glove {{given to him by}} a friend of the family. However, the donated glove was for left-handed fielders. Bostock's discomfort in catching <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> with the hand he was unaccustomed to using led him to begin making basket catches at that time. The habit stayed with him and he frequently made basket catches of <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> for the remainder of his life.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a <b>fly</b> <b>ball.</b> Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|In an August 16 contest {{against the}} Marlins, Heyward hit {{two home runs}} for his first multi-home run game with the Cardinals. An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies {{left-hander}} Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the historic Wrigley Field. He narrowly missed completing a perfect game by walking two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able to snag the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, who now has tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E
50|$|A superb contact hitter, he is {{also known}} for his {{exemplary}} defensive play. He won the Golden Glove award in six consecutive years between 1998 and 2003. Despite his brilliant records, Takahashi has injured himself numerous {{times over the years}} going after <b>fly</b> <b>balls.</b> The injuries primarily resulted from his play style, in which he does not give up on <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> until they hit the ground. His first injury was on September 14, 1999 at a Chunichi Dragons game, where he jumped diagonally against the outfield fence, causing a fractured shoulder bone.|$|R
5000|$|On December 8, 2014, the Athletics traded Moss to the Cleveland Indians in {{exchange}} for Joey Wendle. [...] During the off-season, he had surgery to correct a hip labral tear and gluteal tear, affecting his performance in 2015. As Moss commented, he had lost torque in his swing. Thus, he [...] "hit <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> with the same rate, struck {{out at the same}} rate, walked at almost the same rate. Those <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> were not going over the fence, they were caught." [...] He played 94 games with Cleveland, hitting 15 HR with 50 RBI.|$|R
50|$|The bullpens {{are located}} along (and close to) {{the left and}} right field foul lines and there are no {{barriers}} that separate them from the field of play. In fact, <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> hit into the bullpens are in play. The bullpen players and the pitching mounds are obstacles for fielders chasing <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> into the pen. Teams have to station a batboy behind the catchers in the bullpens to prevent them from being hit by foul balls from behind. This style of bullpen used to be common in the Major Leagues, and is still in use in 2 other stadiums.|$|R
5|$|Through {{the first}} three innings of the fifth game, both {{pitchers}} held the opposing team to no runs and {{a limited number of}} hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to center fielder Wattie Holm.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a <b>fly</b> <b>ball,</b> and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{started the}} season with 13 {{consecutive}} saves but blew his first save of the season on May 27 by giving up a three-run inside-the-park home run on a misplayed <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> by teammate Delmon Young; however, Nathan got two outs to end the 9th inning and the Twins {{went on to win}} the game. By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves and a career best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16. Nathan ranked seventh in the majors in saves and had the lowest ERA of the top 30 save leaders in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Carey was nicknamed [...] "Scoop" [...] for {{his ability}} to catch <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> in front of him. His mark of 738 stolen bases {{remained}} a National League record, until Lou Brock surpassed it in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|In baseball, shagging is {{the act of}} {{catching}} <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> in the outfield outside {{the context of an}} actual baseball game. [...] This is most commonly done by pitchers during batting practice before a game, where they assist their hitting teammates by catching or picking up their batted baseballs and throwing them back to the pitching area in the infield. Batboys also help shagging baseballs, and it is reportedly considered a great honor among batboys to be asked to do this. [...] This pre-game activity is widely disliked by pitchers, who argue that it does not benefit them at all, since it drains their energy and actually increases the risk of stiffness in the lower back and leg as a result of prolonged standing. [...] In response to these claims, several teams have exempted pitchers from having to shag <b>fly</b> <b>balls.</b> In the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league, teams pay groups specifically assembled to shag <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> in place of pitchers, and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim recruit local firefighters in Arizona to do the job when the team plays in the Cactus League during spring training.|$|R
50|$|Baseball writer Murray Chass {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between this World Series game and a World Series game Maddux pitched against the Cleveland Indians a year prior, {{which resulted in a}} loss by the Indians, who scored two unearned runs. In this game, Maddux earned nineteen ground outs and pitched two <b>fly</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|R
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, {{but he could not}} come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{responded by}} scoring three {{runs in the}} bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell {{followed}} and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's <b>fly</b> <b>ball,</b> so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E
50|$|Warren Spahn {{was at his}} much-needed best, winning Game 4, 3-0, on a two-hit shutout over Yankee ace Whitey Ford. Yankee left-fielder, Norm Siebern (playing for {{the injured}} Elston Howard), had trouble fielding with the {{afternoon}} sun blazing, losing <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> in the sixth and eighth innings accounting for two Milwaukee runs.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} one of the best {{defensive}} outfielders of his time, receiving six consecutive Gold Gloves from 1980 through 1985. Murphy had a signature play where his hat blew off his head virtually every time he made a spectacular catch. It occasionally even happened on routine <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> and it eventually became Murphy's trademark.|$|R
50|$|Grichuk drew {{widespread}} {{attention for}} his raw power and bat speed in 2015. As of August 11, 2015, the average exit velocity {{of all his}} batted balls on the season was seventh {{in the major leagues}} at 93.17 mph. The average for all <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> and line drives only was fourth at 97.79 mph.|$|R
5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth {{followed}} with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base. Hornsby laid down a sacrifice bunt to Shocker, moving each runner up a base. Bottomley hit a single into left field, scoring both Douthit and Southworth. The next two batters, Les Bell and Chick Hafey, hit into outs to conclude the inning. In {{the top of the}} seventh inning. Bob O'Farrell lined a double, and Tommy Thevenow {{followed with a}} single into left field. Pitcher Alexander popped up to Lazzeri, and Douthit followed with a <b>fly</b> <b>ball</b> to left field. Southworth then hit a three-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 5–2 advantage over the Yankees. Hornsby then grounded out to Koenig to end the inning. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.|$|E
50|$|As a {{major league}} {{baseball}} player, defensively, he played in a shallow manner, so as {{to cut down on}} potential Texas leaguers. Crawford's strong arm was able to cut down ambitious baserunners. Also, he was able to get a good jump on the ball and used his full speed to track down deep <b>fly</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Initially, {{they had}} a student-teacher relationship. Crawford was an {{established}} star when Cobb arrived, and Cobb eagerly sought his advice. In interviews with Al Stump, Cobb told of studying Crawford's base stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing <b>fly</b> <b>balls</b> and throwing out base runners. Cobb told Stump he would always remember Crawford's kindness.|$|R
50|$|Former MLB first baseman/outfielder Ben Broussard {{worked out}} for five teams in Austin, Texas today, {{according}} to Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports (on Twitter).
