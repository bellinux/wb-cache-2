Moreover, tubes and pores play more significant role at low porosity; filling time increases linearly with resin viscosity raised; filling time declines as injection pressure increased; the time is in inverse proportion to the injection pressure, which is corresponded with Darcy’s Law.

This has in turn allowed shorter high-energy-physics run lengths so that a higher average luminosity is maintained.

30|$|The mining {{technology}} {{is the same as}} the traditional mining. Backfilling and mining work in parallel. Backfill proceeds from the tail to the head of the backfilling conveyor. After the material is accumulated to a certain height the next unloading hole is open and a machine rammer presses a tamping slab to tamp the material. This process would be repeated until the material has been sufficiently tamped and in general, it takes two or three cycles. The first round of backfilling would pause after the face has been fully filled. The backfilling conveyor then moves forward toward the head of the back beam and the compactor pushes all of the material that remains under the backfilling conveyor back and above till solid material reaches the roof. In this way, the material is being pushed toward the roof and compacted. Finally, close the unloading holes to back fill the space below the conveyor headpiece. After the first back <b>filling</b> <b>cycle</b> is completed, the conveyor would be pushed to the end of the back beam to start another cycle.|$|E

The intermediate cells underlying the umbrella cells do not have uroplakins but their membranes are an order of magnitude stiffer. Using uroplakin knockout mouse models we show that cell compliance is conferred by uroplakins.

30|$|In this paper, incised valley filling deposits, which {{formed an}} {{important}} pathway system for long-distance hydrocarbon migration, {{are discussed in}} detail based on core and logging data. The sequence SQy 23 of the Cretaceous Yaojia Formation is the main hydrocarbon-bearing layer in the Fulaerji Oilfield. The hydrocarbon source of the oilfield is the Qijia-Gulong Sag which is about 80 km away from the Fulaerji Oilfield. The transport layer of long-distance hydrocarbon migration is the overlapped sandstone complex which fills the incised valley. The incised valley developed during the depositional period from the late Qingshankou Formation to the early Yaojia Formation of Cretaceous (SQqn 4 -SQy 1) was about 70 km long and 20 km wide, and extended in the NW-SE direction. The overlapped filling of the incised valley mainly occurred in the expanding system tract of the third-order sequence SQy 23 (ESTy 23). Towards the basin, incised valley filling deposits overlapped on the delta developed in the early period, and towards the basin margin, incised valley filling deposits were covered by the shore-shallow lacustrine sandy beach bar developed in the maximum flooding period. All of the delta, the incised valley filling and the shore-shallow sandy beach bar are sandstone-rich, and have high porosity and permeability, and can form an effective hydrocarbon migration and accumulation system. Deltaic sand bodies collected and pumped hydrocarbon from the active source, incised valley filling depositional system completed the long-distance hydrocarbon migration, and lithological traps of shore-shallow lacustrine sandy beach bar accumulated hydrocarbon. The incised valley filling sequences are multi-cycle: an integrated shortterm <b>filling</b> <b>cycle</b> was developed on the erosion surface, and the sequences upward were mud-gravel stone, medium-fine sandstone containing terrigenous gravels and muddy pebbles with cross bedding, silty mudstone with ripple bedding, and mudstone. The incised valley filling deposits are characterized by a strong heterogeneity and the main hydrocarbon migration pathway is the medium-fine sandstone interval.|$|E
40|$|A {{three year}} long {{study has been}} carried out of the {{distribution}} of zinc, lead and cadmium within the water, sediments and submerged plants of the Derwent Reservoir and its catchment These studies have been extended to include detailed field investigations of the accumulation of heavy metals by Lemanea fluviatilis, an alga common in the R. Derwent Further field and laboratory investigations have been carried out of the tolerance to zinc of Stxgeoclonxum tenue. Elevated concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium were shown to be present, in the water and sediments of the R. Derwent at its point of entry to the Derwent Reservoir. These metals were derived mainly from Bolts Burn, a polluted tributary. This latter stream was found to receive inputs of heavy metals from clearly defined sources within an active fluorspar mine. Although old mine workings were present within the catchment, these had a relatively small effect on the composition of water in Bolts Burn and the R. Derwent. Detailed investigations of the composition of stream and river water enabled various aspects of the behaviour of different fractions of metals to be described and compared in polluted and non-polluted reaches. The concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium within the water, sediments and submerged plants of the Derwent Reservoir were found to be high when compared with data from other published studies. The pollution of the reservoir with these metals may therefore be regarded as serious. Surveys of the distribution of heavy metals in the water column were carried out at different stages in the <b>filling</b> <b>cycle</b> of the reservoir. These, together with surveys of the composition of sediments and submerged plants, enabled several of the major factors influencing the distribution of metals within the reservoir to be determined. Studies of the accumulation of heavy metals by 47 populations of Lemanea fluviatilis indicated that the alga is a potentially useful 'monitor' of pollution by zinc, lead and cadmium in flowing waters. Although the enrichment ratios for these metals were not constant over a range of concentrations in the water, clear linear relationships were apparent between the concentrations of each metal in the water and in filaments of Lemanea. Intensive sampling from a single population in the R. Derwent demonstrated that a proportion of the zinc content of filaments was sensitive to short term fluctuations in the zinc content of the surrounding water. The results of a series of transplant experiments are also reported. Stigeoclonium tenue was found to be abundant in several streams carrying relatively high concentrations of zinc in the water A study of populations isolated from 35 reaches demonstrated that material growing in higher concentrations of zinc in the field had an enhanced tolerance to zinc. This tolerance was stable during long term culturing, and appeared to have a genetic basis. Assays of populations from harder waters suggested that high concentrations of calcium acted to reduce the toxicity of zinc in the field. Further studies performed in the laboratory demonstrated that increases in pH and the concentrations of magnesium, calcium and phosphate all acted to reduce the toxicity of zinc to Stigeoclonium tenue. However, the effects of these factors on toxicity were found to differ between a zinc sensitive population and a zinc tolerant populatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{study has}} {{attempted}} to characterise the physicochemical limnology and distribution of algal flora of two salt lake systems in Western Australia, one from the coastal Esperance region and the other from the inland Kambalda region. Climatic conditions, water regimes and physicochemistry were found to differ markedly between the two lake systems {{and a total of}} 171 algal taxa, representing five divisions, were recorded. Of these, 82 were members of Bacillariophyta, 48 of Cyanophyta, 33 of Chlorophyta, two of Euglenophyta and six of Dinophyta. The physical limnology of salt lakes in the Esperance region was seasonally variable, defined by climatic conditions. As such, the lakes investigated in the region exhibited a stable cycle of filling during winter and spring, and drying out in summer. Four of the lakes in the region could be classified as near-permanent, and one as seasonal on the basis of predictability and duration of filling. Seasonal fluctuations in water depth resulted in fluctuations in salinity levels. Salinity levels ranged from subsaline to hypersaline, and all the lakes in the region were alkaline. In addition, the lakes were well mixed in terms of oxygen and temperature, and were impacted by eutrophication from their catchments. They were either mesotrophic or eutrophic with respect to both nitrogen and phosphorus. In geological terms, lakes in the Esperance region were separated only recently from the ocean, and two lakes retain a connection with marine waters, one through a creek during years of high rainfall and one through hydrological interactions with groundwater of marine origin. In general, the algal communities of lakes in the Esperance region were similar to those of other Australian coastal salt lakes. Diatoms and cyanobacteria were dominant in all lakes except the most eutrophic, Lake Warden, in which benthic green algae were most abundant. All algal species recorded were known for their wide geographic distribution and their distribution in Australian coastal waters. Characteristically coastal diatom species included Achnanthes brevipes, Achnanthes coarctata, Achnanthes lanceolata var. dubia, Achnanthidium cruciculum, Campylodiscus clypeus, Cyclotella atomus, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Cyclotella striata, Mastogloia elliptica, Mastoglia pumila, Nitzschia punctata and Thalassiosira weissflogii. The inland salt lakes of the Kambalda region form part of an extensive palaeodrainage system, and were much less predictable in terms water regime than lakes in Esperance. Water depth was determined by seasonal variability in rainfall and evaporation, and by summer cyclonic rainfall events that were unreliable from year to year. In addition, rainfall varied spatially within the region. As such, most lakes were classified as intermittent. Two lakes in the region were not classified on the basis of water regime as they were too highly impacted by mining activities including water diversion and impoundment, water extraction and discharge of groundwater. Salinity varied in accordance with drying and filling cycles in the lakes except the most hypersaline as the volume of water received during rainfall events was insufficient to dilute the extensive surface salt crusts they each supported when dry. Salinities recorded in the region ranged from subsaline to hypersaline, and ionic compositions exhibited the same spectrum as seawater. Calcium levels were significantly higher than in lakes from the Esperance region due to weathering of calcium rich sediments, and pH ranged from weakly acidic in the most hypersaline lakes to alkaline in the least saline lakes. All were well mixed in terms of oxygen and temperature. Kambalda salt lakes support distinctive algal communities dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria that are adapted to intermittent water regimes, extended periods of desiccation and variable salinity. Not surprisingly then, none of the algal taxa recorded from the region were regionally restricted, all noted previously in the literature to have wide geographic distributions, and to be tolerant of a range of physicochemical conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that, of the physicochemical parameters that were investigated in this study, both salinity and pH interacted in determining algal community structure. Both of these attributes were correlated with water depth, which varied according to climatic conditions in a seasonal drying and <b>filling</b> <b>cycle.</b> The general relationship between species richness and pH and salinity, and species diversity and pH and salinity was simple and linear; with increasing pH and salinity, species diversity and species richness decreased. What was less simple, and non-linear, was {{the nature of the relationship}} between species richness and diversity and salinity within more narrowly defined ranges of salinity. As salinity increased from < 1 ppt to 30 ppt there was a dramatic reduction in species richness and diversity, then, as salinity increased from 30 ppt to 100 ppt the rate of decrease slowed. Between 100 ppt and 250 ppt there was almost no relationship between salinity and species richness and species diversity, but after 250 ppt both species diversity and species richness declined markedly...|$|E
30|$|Those {{unconventional}} {{oil shale}} resources containing more than 50 % of their initial hydrocarbon generation potential {{will be able}} to produce significant quantities of hydrocarbons by hydraulic fracturing. As long as they are hosted in thick marl series preventing tertiary hydrocarbon migration to reservoir rocks, desorption of hydrocarbons may be achieved by the existence of natural fracturing and microfracturing as well as a juxtaposed rich organic bed alternated with the poor organic ones. In this context, dark shales may provide hydrocarbons by thermal cracking that would migrate into clear limestone facies constituting thin reservoirs into black shale source rocks. Taking account of all those characteristics, the Aptian–Albian petroleum source rock system can be qualified, according to the unconventional source rock classification established by Jarvie (2012), as an “unconventional oil shale hybrid systems with a combination of juxtaposed organic-rich and organic-lean intervals associated to open fractures”.

This problem suggests that narrow channel fills are not ideal for environmental reconstruction and should be avoided in favour of wide low energy valley fills, which {{can be found in the}} eastern highlands. The pollen contents of the two sequences nevertheless, suggest marked variation that indicates climate variability during the Holocene in the area. The general pollen contents in the channel deposits appear typical of the regional grassland (Scott 1989) except for relatively high proportions of Asteraceae and smooth trilete fern spores. A possible explanation for the prominent Asteraceae may be found in relatively dry, sandy conditions on the north facing slope where the site is situated, while the trilete spores are possibly derived from upslope vegetation of rocky outcrops...|$|R

The pulsating mixer pump technology was identified during FY 1996 and FY 1997 technical exchanges between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tanks Focus Area Retrieval and Closure program, the DOE Environmental Management International Programs, and delegates from Russia as a promising technology that could be implemented in the DOE complex. During FY 1997, the pulsating mixer pump technology, provided by the Russian Integrated Mining Chemical Company, was tested at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to observe its ability to suspend settled solids. Based on the results of this demonstration, ORNL and DOE staff determined that a modified pulsating mixer pump would meet project needs for remote sludge mobilization of Gunite tank sludge and reduce the cost of operation and maintenance of more expensive mixing systems. The functions and requirements of the system were developed by combining the results and recommendations from the pulsating mixer pump demonstration at PNNL with the requirements identified by staff at ORNL involved with the remediation of the Gunite and Associated Tanks.

To counter this, many regions have adopted improved land management schemes aiming at restoring the physical, biological and hydrological integrity of the landscape. Therefore, much {{attention has been given}} to the rehabilitation and renaturalization of headwater streams and gullies. Despite recent successes in land rehabilitation for many areas worldwide, optimizing the management of (agricultural) landscapes remains challenging, especially considering global trends in land use and climate change. In this paper, an analysis is presented on indirect (catchment-wide) and direct (operating at the channel) gully rehabilitation measures and their success, by reviewing literature from dryland environments across the world. Understanding the success of gully rehabilitation measures was done by adding the life-cycle of a gully to the analysis, indicating that the success of gully rehabilitation is linked to the hydrogeomorphic development phase of gullies. From cut to <b>fill</b> <b>cycle,</b> gullies typically develop through a number of hydrogeomorphic phases, in which different geomorphic responses become dominant (from headcut retreat and downcutting, to widening and eventually, infilling).

40|$|Snowmelt {{dominated}} streamflow of the Western Himalayan Rivers is {{an important}} water resource during the dry pre-monsoon spring months to meet the irrigation and hydropower needs in Northern India. Here we study the seasonal prediction of melt-dominated total inflow into the Bhakra Dam in Northern India based on statistical relationships with meteorological variables during the preceding winter. Total inflow into the Bhakra dam includes the Satluj River flow together with a flow diversion from its tributary, the Beas River. Both are tributaries of the Indus River that originate from the Western Himalayas, which is an under-studied region. Average measured winter snow volume at the upper elevation stations and corresponding lower elevation rainfall and temperature of the Satluj River basin were considered as empirical predictors. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were used to select the best subset of inputs from all the possible combinations of predictors for a multiple linear regression framework. To test for potential issues arising due to multi-collinearity of the predictor variables, cross-validated prediction skills of best subset were also compared with the prediction skills of Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) techniques, which yielded broadly similar results. As a whole, the forecasts of the melt season {{at the end of}} winter and as the melt season commences were shown to have potential skill for guiding the development of stochastic optimization models to manage the trade-off between irrigation and hydropower releases versus flood control during the annual <b>fill</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Bhakra reservoir, a major energy and irrigation source in the region...|$|R

40|$|Ecosystem {{engineering}} {{refers to}} the way that organisms control the structure and function of ecosystems. It {{has been suggested that}} palmiet (Prionium serratum, Thurniaceae) works as an ecosystem engineer, shaping peat wetlands in South Africa. However, there is currently a paucity of evidence supporting this claim. Palmiet has a dense root, rhizome and stem system that forms dense stands, growing from channel banks into fast flowing river channels. This slows river flows, traps sediment, which builds up riverbeds and ultimately blocks river channels, turning the river into a wetland. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if palmiet is an ecosystem engineer and to document its pattern of colonisation and the nature of its control of a fluvial system. This was achieved by undertaking vegetation surveys in the Kromrivier Wetland in the Eastern Cape. The data was analyzed using vegetation classification and ordination, where vegetation communities were linked to environmental factors. It was found that palmiet occupied three distinctive habitats; 1) on near-horizontal valley- bottom habitats filled with sediments that are a mixture of autochthonous organic sediment and allochthonous clastic fines, 2) the bed of gullies that have recently filled with coarse grained clastic sediment, and 3) open water bodies. Three conceptual models were developed, one that accounts for the process of gully bed colonisation, sediment trapping and gully filling, another involving rapid colonisation of sedimentary fill from tributary sediment sources that block a gully, and the third involving colonisation of open-water areas that form in former gullies upstream of the blockage. The study suggests that the wetland has been characterised by repeated cutting and <b>filling</b> <b>cycles,</b> despite which, palmiet has repeatedly reinstated diffuse flow conditions across the valley floor.

40|$|Arroyos are steep-walled, entrenched, {{typically}} ephemeral streams {{commonly found}} in dryland river systems that form when streams incise into previously deposited alluvial fill. Arroyos in the southwestern U. S. have been studied extensively following the historic period of arroyo cutting in the late 1800 s and early 1900 s A. D. The upper Escalante River in south-central Utah similarly began incising in 1909, and records evidence for past cut and <b>fill</b> <b>cycles</b> in well-exposed walls along the now continuous arroyo. Establishing robust geochronologies of past arroyo cycles in these fluvial settings has been difficult. Recent improvements in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (14 C) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating {{provide an opportunity to}} link more highly resolved fluvial records to existing paleoclimate records. This allows hypotheses regarding the causes of arroyo cycles to be tested, and for the role of climate versus intrabasinal characteristics to be examined. One major objective of this research was to examine the applicability of OSL and AMS 14 C dating in the upper Escalante, as both methods have proved problematic in similar settings. In total, 37 ages were obtained, 21 OSL and 16 14 C ages. The Holocene fluvial history of the upper Escalante River was reconstructed using these age results and stratigraphic relationships. The chronostratigraphic record developed in this study suggests that at least six arroyo cycles have occurred in the upper Escalante since the middle Holocene, with incision occurring ~ 4. 4 – 4. 2 ka, ~ 2. 6 – 2. 4 ka, ~ 1. 8 – 1. 5 ka, ~ 1. 0 – 0. 9 ka, ~ 0. 5 - 0. 4 ka, and during the historic period of arroyo entrenchment. While semi-synchronous arroyo cutting (indicative of a climate signal) appears to have occurred in the Paria and Escalante drainages over the last 1 ka, correlations between proximal drainages are less clear prior to 1 ka, although this may be due in part to preservation effects. Overall, linkages to specific climate regimes and correlations to regional drainages are difficult to identify, suggesting that internal geomorphic thresholds are important in determining when arroyo entrenchment occurs in individual catchments...|$|R

Analyses of the sedimentary filling of paleokarsts help completing the geological record of regions that have been submitted to post-depositional, long-term, continental evolution. Jurassic carbonate platform of Languedoc (South of France) has undergone several karstification phases from Cretaceous to Neogene. Later incision of canyons through the carbonate massifs allows to observe paleokarsts over 400 m depth, within the massifs. Paleokarsts are partly filled with sediments. Some have yielded marine bioclasts (echinoderms, radiolars), foraminifera and nannofossils; others are composed of polygenic detrital sediments, including sources from the upstream Paleozoic basement (Cevennes). The age of the filling of successive paleokarsts can be constrained by structural relationships and by biostratigraphy. These findings suggests 1) the marine elements of the karstic filling relate to a Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene interval, while 2) the Paleozoic basement-sourced-sediments were trapped in the karst during Miocene to Present. Karstic sediment containing Early Paleocene foraminifera and nannofossils are found in paleokarsts cavities distributed across the entire thickness of the carbonate massif (≥ 350 m). This requires base-level lowering and associated karstification, followed by base-level rise and karst filling of at least 350 m amplitude, respectively. The time interval corresponding to the occurrence of foraminifera and nannofossils in karsts covers 10 Myrs; surprisingly, no equivalent marine sediments are preserved on the surface. In addition, analyses of the different forams species suggests several (up to 3) distinct karstification and marine <b>filling</b> <b>cycles.</b> Finally, sedimentological facies analysis of the karst filling reveals the following succession of processes: low energy settling of mudstone, high energy reworking, transport and deposition of silts and sandstones within the karst system. Integration of geological, paleontological and sedimentological data, leads to a polyphase scenario in response to repeated base-level variations, more than 350 m amplitude. Such an amplitude excludes eustacy, and the improbable repeated sequence of uplift and subsidence rules out tectonics, as driving forces for base-level change, respectively. We propose that the high-amplitude base-level changes results from a succession of desiccation-flooding events of an endorheic, silled, basin during Early Paleogene. The later detrital assemblage sourced in the Cevennes occurs on perched paleosurfaces and in karst cavities across the whole 350 m-deep canyon walls. When found on paleosurfaces, they correspond to the south-flowing Early Miocene fluvial drainage, and can be correlated downstream with the marine, well dated, Early Miocene, sediments. When found within the karst cavities, they correspond to successive base-level surfaces connected to the progressive incision of the canyon. This canyon incision is coeval with a Late Miocene uplift of the hinterland...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{practical}} decision problem of fresh food production {{with a long}} production lead time to decide every period (e. g. week) how many items to produce. When a batch is ready for use, its items have a fixed shelf life, after which the items become waste {{in the sense that}} they cannot be sold anymore. The demand for (fresh) food products is uncertain and highly fluctuating, mainly caused by price promotions of retail organisations. We focus on cases where a so-called <b>cycle</b> <b>fill</b> rate service level requirement applies. We investigate the generation of a production plan that fixes the timing and quantity of the production for a finite time horizon. To minimise waste, one issues the oldest items first, i. e. a FIFO issuing policy. In case of out-of-stock, sales are lost. We model this decision problem as a Stochastic Programming (SP) model. The objective of our study is to find order quantities for the SP model, that approximately meet <b>cycle</b> <b>fill</b> rate service level requirements while keeping outdating low. To find approximate solutions for the SP model, an MILP model is developed. The MILP model is a deterministic approximation that generates feasible replenishment quantities in less than a second. With a scenario-based MINLP approach, optimal solutions are generated for a large sample of demand paths as a benchmark for the MILP solutions. We show that the MILP model is suitable for practical use if the setup cost is such that the replenishment cycles in the production plan are close to or of the same length as the maximum shelf life. In those cases, the expected total costs are close to the costs of the optimal solution and the average fill rate is close to the required one. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Geomorphological, sedimentological and geochronological {{analyses}} {{have been}} undertaken {{to decipher the}} effects of Quaternary environmental change {{on the development of}} the Rio Bergantes, Ebro basin, northeast Spain. Field mapping and profiling using aerial photography and airborne LiDAR data have identified a sequence of six river terraces. Age control, provided by luminescence dating, has revealed two major phases of valley floor aggradation that appear to have occurred at ~ 183 ? 130 ka (Terrace BT 1, elevated ~ 25 m above the modern river channel) and ~ 111 ? 26. 8 ka (BT 2, ~ 18 ? 20 m above the modern river channel), punctuated by ~ 20 m of incision in the intervening period. Following these two phases of large-scale aggradation, the Bergantes river system appears to have adjusted to a relatively sediment-limited regime and responded to environmental changes through a series of smaller cut and <b>fill</b> <b>cycles.</b> This resulted in four lower elevation terraces (BT 3 ?BT 6) that are inset within the older (BT 1 and BT 2) valley fills. These lower terraces have been temporally constrained to ~ 24. 5 ? 14. 2 ka (BT 3); 10. 6 ? 9. 8 ka (BT 4); 8. 3 ? 6. 2 ka (BT 5) and ~ 3 ka (BT 6). Field sedimentological and stratigraphic analyses of the alluvial fills indicate the influence of tributary and hill slope derived sediment supply during the aggradation of BT 1 and, to a lesser extent BT 2. This contrasts with the predominantly trunk river derived deposits which make up the fill of BT 3 ?BT 6, when the hillslopes and tributaries in the study area appear to have been relatively de-coupled from the trunk river. Data presented in this paper suggest that the Bergantes river system has responded to, and has preserved, a record of environmental changes operating both in synchrony with, and at a higher frequency than, Milankovitch-driven glacial?interglacial cycles. Major net aggradation phases (those associated with relatively large amounts of fluvial sediment e. g. BT 1 and BT 2) appear to coincide with Pleistocene glacial conditions in MIS 6, and parts of MIS 5 and MIS 4, when the climate on the Iberian Peninsula was cool and dry. Intervening phases of net valley incision appear to coincide with warmer and moister climates in Pleistocene interglacials. The younger terraces (BT 3 ?BT 6) are characterised by much smaller amounts of fluvial sediment supply. Dating control places their development during stadial (aggradation) and interstadial (incision) events of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Some phases of aggradation appear to coincide with North Atlantic Heinrich Events, and also with other securely dated phases of aggradation elsewhere in the Mediterranean basin. Peer reviewe...|$|R

These were {{backed by a}} set of sixty-four registers each for S and A temporary storage known as T and B respectively, which could not be seen by the functional units. The vector system added another eight 64-element by 64-bit vector (V) registers, as well as a vector length (VL) and vector mask (VM). Finally, the system also included a 64-bit real-time clock register and four 64-bit instruction buffers that held sixty-four 16-bit instructions each. The hardware was set up to allow the vector registers to be fed at one word per cycle, while the address and scalar registers required two cycles.
