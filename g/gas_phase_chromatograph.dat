The <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> results were analyzed as both clean gas (without any particles) and unclean gas (with particles).

Epicatalysts overcome the third principle when gas-surface interactions are appreciable and gas-phase collisions are rare. Under these conditions the gas particles that desorb from an epicatalytic surface can retain characteristics of the gas-surface interactions far away from the surface because <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> collisions are too infrequent to establish normal <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> equilibrium.

The objective {{is to examine the}} importance of chemical kinetic studies for propellant deflagration modelling in general and for AP in particular. A reaction mechanism consisting of ninety five elementary reactions involving twenty one chemical species is developed to represent the AP <b>gas</b> <b>phase.</b> An important parameter that can be obtained from the kinetics is the time rate of change of temperature of the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> at the condensed phase-gas phase boundary (dT/dt at t = 0). This {{is directly related to the}} heat feedback from the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> to the condensed phase. Comparison with earlier work indicates that the use of a one-step overall reaction could lead to underestimates of heat feedback from the <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> by a factor of about four. In addition it is found that the rate of decrease of dT/dt at t = 0, with pressure is much larger at lower pressures, suggesting a possible <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> role in the low pressure deflagration limit. Further, the kinetic study does not support the conclusion of a constant fraction of AP reacting in the condensed phase in the pressure range 20 - 100 atmospheres. These results are at variance with what is obtained by use of a one-step overall reaction. Thus, the one-step overall reaction cannot represent even qualitatively several <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> characteristics important for deflagration studies, and its use leads to erroneous results. It is concluded that a full reaction mechanism representation of <b>gas</b> <b>phase</b> chemical kinetics is essential to AP deflagration modelling.
