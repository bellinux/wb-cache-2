5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume <b>excluded</b> from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very}} little volume that is <b>excluded</b> from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} <b>excluded</b> from Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, {{who believed}} him {{to not have}} fully recovered from the serious injury he had sustained during the season.

Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E

5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been <b>excluded,</b> and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo <b>excluded,</b> while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E
