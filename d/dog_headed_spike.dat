Tom is startled and almost claws through the wall before he sees the mouse and chases Jerry, {{spotting}} him in a bone-hat. Tom bolts after him, and Jerry hides. Convinced {{that the end of}} the dog bone nearby is Jerry in disguise, Tom grabs it and is met by an angry Spike. As Spike chomps down, Tom causes Spike to swallow his bone and hides underneath a huge St. Bernard, which goes to sleep and Tom pops out from under it without the <b>dog</b> <b>head.</b> Tom wakes the dog and is hanging from the collar. Tom attaches the head to his rear and pops out again, waking the dog again. The <b>dog</b> sees Tom's <b>head,</b> but Tom switches ends and leaves. Tom hides in a barrel and notices Jerry is doing the same. He breaks open the barrel and chases Jerry until Jerry hides in another dog's fur. Jerry swims in the fur and gets Tom to dive in. This wakes up the dog and he scratches both cat and mouse out of his fur. Jerry stops, trips Tom, and gains the <b>dog</b> <b>head</b> for himself. <b>Spike</b> comes around the corner and briefly sees Tom's real head, but Tom quickly hides it. Jerry leaves and Spike (now looking quite frightened) looks at Tom's apparently headless body, which cheerfully waves at him then waddles off after its 'head'. This proves to be the last straw for poor Spike, who emits a terrified, womanlike scream heard in Fraidy Cat.|$|R

50|$|In Greek art, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of depictions of Heracles and Cerberus occur on Attic vases. Although the lost Corinthian cup shows Cerberus with a single <b>dog</b> <b>head,</b> and the relief pithos fragment (c. 590-570 BC) apparently shows a single lion-headed Cerberus, in Attic vase painting, Cerberus usually has two <b>dog</b> <b>heads.</b> In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed. Occasionally, in Roman art, Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head, and two smaller <b>dog</b> <b>heads</b> on either side.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{earliest}} description of Cerberus, Hesiod's Theogony (c. 8th - 7th century BC), Cerberus has fifty heads, while Pindar (c. 522 - c. 443 BC) gave him one hundred heads. However, later writers almost universally give Cerberus three heads. An {{exception is the}} Latin poet Horace's Cerberus which has a single <b>dog</b> <b>head,</b> and one hundred snake heads. Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions, Apollodorus's Cerberus has three <b>dog</b> <b>heads</b> and the heads of [...] "all sorts of snakes" [...] along his back, while the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes (who probably based his account on Apollodorus) gives Cerberus fifty heads, three of which were <b>dog</b> <b>heads,</b> the rest being the [...] "heads of other beasts of all sorts".|$|R
