Pop Dust writer Nate Jones compared the introductory lyrics, [...] "I got my red dress on tonight/ Dancing {{in the dark}} in the pale moonlight" [...] to [...] "Dancing in the Dark" [...] by Bruce Springsteen, affirming that the song's inherent somberness was building to its gloomy denouement by first displaying positive memories the song's lovers experienced. The following two stanzas of: [...] "Got my hair up real big beauty queen style / High heels off, I'm feeling alive" [...] and [...] "...Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere/ Nothing scares me anymore" [...] building on the same lyrical imagery. Lyrically, the song reaches the sadder conclusion with the chorus, [...] "Kiss me hard before you go / Summertime sadness/ <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know/ That baby you're the best." [...] The darkest portion of the song's story swells {{at the beginning of}} the second verse: [...] "I'm feelin' electric tonight/ Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99/ Got my bad baby by my heavenly side/I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight." [...] As a whole, [...] "Summertime Sadness" [...] follows a typical pop song structure: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, with the chorus circulating several times before the song's end.|$|E

Our main aim is {{to raise awareness of}} higher-order knowledge, i. e. knowledge about knowledge, as an issue in simulating realistic non-player characters in computer games. We motivate the importance of higher-order knowledge with arguments, as well as a few examples. We survey existing games and literature to show that this issue is currently neglected. We also refer to our earlier work to illustrate one approach to simulating higher-order reasoning, which we call “explicit knowledge programming”. Finally we describe a number of issues which arise when carrying out such an implementation, some of which go beyond the scope of the present motivation of computer gaming, and are of more general interest. ...|$|E
