5|$|By early 1990, Ryan's {{health was}} deteriorating rapidly. In his final public appearance, he hosted an after-Oscars party with former {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{and his wife}} Nancy Reagan in California.

60|$|Hence wicked men's hope {{is said to}} die, not before, {{but with}} them; they give up the ghost together. And thus did Mr. Badman.

5|$|The result {{extended}} Ferrari's {{lead over}} McLaren in the Constructors' Championship from seven to 11points. Third-placed in the Drivers' Championship, Robert Kubica's sixth {{place at the}} Grand Prix eliminated <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> of winning the Championship, and reduced his lead over fourth-placed Räikkönen to six points. Nelson Piquet Jr. scored his last ever world championship points at this race.|$|E
5|$|William and {{his eldest}} son, George, Earl of Munster, were estranged at the time, but William hoped that {{a letter of}} condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation. <b>His</b> <b>hopes</b> were not {{fulfilled}} and Munster, still thinking {{he had not been}} given sufficient money or patronage, remained bitter to the end.|$|E
5|$|Zosky was a collegiate star {{prior to}} playing professionally, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} Fresno State University's athletic Hall of Fame.

5|$|A {{week before}} his signing with QPR, Barton was {{involved}} in an altercation with Gervinho of Arsenal, which resulted in Gervinho being sent off on his debut.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine {{announced that}} he was disbanding Megadeth due to an arm injury that rendered him unable to play guitar. In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated that doctors expected that it would take about a year before he would recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to how complete of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> to regain the ability to play guitar. He subsequently recovered following months of physical therapy.|$|E
50|$|Diderot's essay {{contains}} a passionate tribute to modern America; he hails the American Revolution which {{gave rise to}} a new nation in 1776, and its lessons for tyrants in Europe. He declares modern America to possibly be a novel feature in world affairs, and declares <b>his</b> <b>hope</b> that all Americans would continue to always enjoy freedom.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic. He still assumed a firm defence line could eventually be established in North Brabant {{with the help of}} the French and expected good progress could be made in eliminating the airborne forces, while not being aware of any special danger to the Grebbe Line. During the day <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> would be dashed.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. <b>His</b> <b>hopes</b> of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, {{he began}} the Marathon of Hope, a {{cross-country}} run {{to raise money for}} cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland, in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star {{by the time he reached}} Ontario; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs. <b>His</b> <b>hopes</b> of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.|$|E
5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had not moved. Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack {{was not going to}} be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost—and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate acceptable to the imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was paid, and on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion had probably been irrevocably lost, Leopold turned <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new urgency to the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E

5|$|On 20 April, his 56thbirthday, Hitler {{made his}} last trip from the Führerbunker (Führer's shelter) to the surface. In the ruined {{garden of the}} Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy {{soldiers}} of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin. By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced {{to the outskirts of}} Berlin. In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Waffen SS General Felix Steiner. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet {{apparently}} never discarded <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{boosted the}} morale of the Song {{soldiers}} and increased dissatisfaction among the Jin army. News of the victory improved confidence in the government and bolstered the stability of the Song. The Jurchens gave up their ambitions of conquering the Southern Song and reunifying China. The Jin army withdrew in 1162, and diplomatic relations between the two states resumed. Emperor Gaozong retired nine months after the conclusion of the battle. The reasons for his abdication are complicated, but Gaozong's handling of the war with Wanyan Liang may have had a part in his decision to resign. He had ignored the warnings of a Jin attack and <b>his</b> <b>hopes</b> for conciliation held back plans for strengthening the Song defenses.|$|E
