Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

"Upon my honour, sir, {{unless you}} are pleased to be more explicit, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> either <b>to</b> answer or {{understand}} you," [...] said the lady; [...] "you speak too seriously for a masquerade pleasantry, and yet not clearly enough to make your earnest comprehensible." ...|$|R

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> remain in it {{on account of the}} impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride.

His responsibilities encompassed general supervision of all departments of the CBS Television Network. [...] On December 8, 1959, Cowan resigned, having been damaged from his connection to the quiz show scandals. (He created the show The $64,000 Question and owned the company which produced it for the network, though Cowan denied he knew anything about the rigging of the program.) Cowan's letter of resignation to Stanton declared, [...] "you have made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> continue." [...] Aubrey was named president the same day and elected {{to the board of}} directors on December 9, 1959.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it". His emotional state {{made it impossible for}} him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice Taney concurred in the judgment, but {{disagreed}} {{that the}} political branches had interpreted the Tellico treaty to demarcate the relevant boundary.

[...] He [...] "admit [...] [...] [...] that the contracting parties had the power afterwards to settle its position" [...] but argued that [...] "they never saw proper to do [...]" [...] Catron argued that [...] "he land in controversy was granted before this line was run" [...] and thus that the treaty of Holston [...] "will manifestly tend to disturb titles made in reference to another line."

500|$|On July 28, 2010, Rice {{publicly}} {{announced her}} {{disdain for the}} current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, [...] "Today I quit being a Christian....

It's simply <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed.

My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become." ...|$|E
500|$|Princess Ida was {{the first}} of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's {{previous}} standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after Ida opened, Sullivan told Carte that [...] "it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." [...] As Princess Ida showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time. In the meantime, when Ida closed, Carte produced a revival of The Sorcerer.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{wrote to}} Wilson {{the day after}} the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London. The British and Rhodesians {{exchanged}} often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson's High Commissioner in Salisbury, JB Johnston, wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary GeraldB Clarke on 23 December that [...] "talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments". Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: [...] "I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner's letter that I am replying directly to you... It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless... such immoral behaviour {{on the part of the}} British government makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> continue negotiations with you with any confidence that our standards of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail." ...|$|E
500|$|After Patience, Carte {{produced}} Iolanthe, {{which opened}} in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice. Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, [...] "Effectively, [...] made [...] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments." [...] The partnership's next opera, Princess Ida, opened in January 1884. Carte soon saw that Ida was running weakly {{at the box office}} and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music, and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract. In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that [...] "it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Stay you here," [...] said Diana. [...] "I {{know the}} house, and I will call a servant; your sudden {{appearance}} might startle the old gentleman even to choking;" [...] and she escaped from me, leaving me uncertain whether I ought to advance or retreat. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> hear {{some part of}} what passed within the dinner apartment, and particularly several apologies for declining to sing, expressed in a dejected croaking voice, the tones of which, I conceived, were not entirely new <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was, however, <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> entirely <b>to</b> {{restrain}} my impulses, {{and without}} knowing exactly what I {{intended to do}} I advanced toward the house.

Then, peeping under cover of a thicket, I went still nearer, so that, {{if there had been}} any people in the surrounding grounds, I could have seen them; but I saw no one, and I sat down on a log and waited. It shamed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think that I was secretly watching a house, but despite the shame I continued to sit and watch.|$|R

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity... it was pop." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 May 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his [...] "services ... {{rendered}} to {{the promotion}} of the art of music" [...] in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. [...] Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped. [...] In mid-December, he bade farewell to his sister-in-law Charlotte, Fred's widow, who emigrated with her young family to America. Sullivan's oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle's ward. The next opera, Princess Ida (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors, although Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that effectively ended his career at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own longstanding kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, [...] "t is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
