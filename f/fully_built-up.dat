25|$|In 1982, {{a license}} & Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd, and Suzuki of Japan. At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an {{importer}} of cars. In India's closed market, Maruti received {{the right to}} import 40,000 <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> Suzukis {{in the first two}} years, and even after that the early goal was to use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were also some concerns that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales. Finally, in 1983, the Maruti 800 was released. This 796 cc hatchback was based on the SS80 Suzuki Alto and was India’s first affordable car. Initial product plan was 40% saloons, and 60% Maruti Van. Local production commenced in December 1983. In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released and the installed capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.|$|E
2500|$|In Ecuador, {{the local}} plant Aymesa {{assembled}} some {{versions of this}} vehicle. The three-door version was called Suzuki Forsa II, while the four-door sedan version was badged Chevrolet Swift. Production of the sedan ended about 1996, while the hatchback version continued to being produced until 1999 or 2000 and it was badged as Chevrolet Forsa in latter years. It was imported to Colombia from 1991 until 2004, where {{it was called the}} Chevrolet Swift. The hatchback was sold in Indonesia as the Amenity from 1990 until 1992, and, after a facelift, as the Eleny from 1992 until 1994. The sedan arrived in 1991 was marketed as the Suzuki Amenity Esteem, although the [...] "Amenity" [...] portion was soon dropped. Most versions had a carburetted, uncatalyzed version of the 1298cc G13BA engine with [...] at 6000rpm. The Esteem and five-door Amenity/Eleny were assembled CKD in Indonesia, while a small number of three-door hatchbacks were imported <b>fully</b> <b>built-up.</b> The Esteem was also available with a carburetted 1.6-liter engine (SF416), and in 1993 the fuel injected 1.6 GT arrived. The Esteem continued to be available until about 1996.|$|E
50|$|In {{one month}} in 1987, the facelifted Ford Sierra, by then a single station wagon model, was the country's top-selling car range. A few <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> 2.3 V6 five-doors and XR4i three-doors were also {{imported}} from 1984.|$|E
50|$|Stokes Croft was {{predominantly}} rural until around 1700, being mainly {{used for}} market gardening. Urban development was first logged {{in the parish}} records of 1678, while St James Square, {{to the west of}} Stokes Croft, was laid out by around 1710. John Roque's map of Bristol 1750 shows the area built up and running north of a central courtyard between Stokes Croft, North Street and Wilder Street. Though industries were established on Stokes Croft during the 18th century, the road was not <b>fully</b> developed and <b>built-up</b> until around 1850. Construction of the Carriage Works at No. 104 began in 1859, while the City Road Baptist Church was built in 1861.|$|R
5000|$|The B-Type {{eventually}} {{evolved into}} the Dutton Phaeton. Later versions of the Phaeton were based on Ford Escort components and were produced until 1989.

50|$|During 1998 {{tariffs on}} cars {{imported}} fully assembled ended {{as the final}} step of a long-term New Zealand Government plan for the industry. The remaining four local assemblers — Mitsubishi (June), Nissan (July), Honda (August) and Toyota (October)— all ended local assembly and switched to importing <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|The Ordnance Quick Firing 18-pounder Mark I {{gun barrel}} was {{wire-wound}} for {{one-third of its}} length, chosen as it was lighter, stronger and cheaper to manufacture than a <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> barrel. A jacket was shrunk over the wire and [...] "A" [...] tube. The Mk I gun and Mk I carriage were accepted into service on 30 June 1904.|$|E
50|$|In Australia {{the range}} {{began with the}} high roofed two-seater, three-door CC model, {{while the rest of}} the range (CS, CX, CX-A, and turbo CX-T) had five-door bodywork. The Taiwanese {{assembler}} also developed a longer notchback version of the five-door, similar to the Subaru Tutto, sold as the Daihatsu Skywing. In New Zealand, the naturally aspirated petrol model was assembled locally. The Turbo was also sold there, imported <b>fully</b> <b>built-up.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The huge Ludovika Engineer Academy {{was built}} up in 1895 vis-á-vis the than woody excursionspot with famous restaurant-gardens [...] "Szép Ilona". After {{creating}} an association for settling down became the Pasarét the villa-quartier {{in the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the area has been <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> between the two world wars. Great artists and scientists settled here, among others Béla Bartók (composer), Ernö Dohnányi (composer), Imre Nagy (politician), István Örkény (writer), and Antal Szerb (writer).|$|E
50|$|An {{embryonic}} {{automotive industry}} emerged in India in the 1940s. Hindustan Motors {{was launched in}} 1942, long-time competitor Premier in 1944, building Chrysler, Dodge, and Fiat products respectively. Mahindra & Mahindra was established by two brothers in 1945, and began assembly of Jeep CJ-3A utility vehicles. Following independence in 1947, the Government of India {{and the private sector}} launched efforts to create an automotive-component manufacturing industry to supply to the automobile industry. In 1953, an import substitution programme was launched, and the import of <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> cars began to be restricted.|$|E
50|$|This {{sharing of}} models proved unpopular with buyers, {{and also with}} manufacturers, each of which kept the best models in the {{relevant}} ranges for itself. Consequently, the original models outsold their badge engineered counterparts, for example, the Toyota Corolla and Camry outsold the Holden Nova and Apollo seven to one. The last of such models, the Toyota Lexcen (Holden Commodore), was dropped in 1997. Rather than share locally assembled models with other manufacturers, Holden, Ford, and Toyota decided to import <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> models from subsidiaries elsewhere in the world, mainly Europe and Japan. Mitsubishi Motors did not share models with other manufacturers {{during the period of}} the plan and ended Australian manufacturing in 2008; Nissan ended car manufacturing in Australia completely in 1994.|$|E
5000|$|The {{market had}} also been helped by the [...] "brand to brand complement" [...] scheme (BBC), instituted in 1992. This allowed {{component}} manufacturers in Malaysia and Thailand to freely trade certain parts {{in order to help}} them reach economies of scale. The ASEAN Industrial Cooperation Scheme (AICO) helped further the integration of car manufacturers in the region. As a result of the financial crisis, duties on <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> vehicles were increased from 42/68.5 percent (with a 2.4 litre threshold for the lower rate) to a flat rate of 80 percent in November 1997. Thai suppliers had also reached a higher level in the nineties, now offering precision injection-molded pieces and with an eye to producing ever more sophisticated products in the future.|$|E
5000|$|The Volkswagen {{assembly}} plant in Brazil was established after the Brazilian government prohibited {{the import of}} <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> vehicles in 1953. Its first manager was Friedrich Schultz-Wenk, who had emigrated to Brazil in 1950 after a brief stint as {{a prisoner of war}} followed by some time in Wolfsburg. Their first plant was in Ipiranga, São Paulo and was a strict Knock-down kit operation. In two years 2268 Fuscas and 552 Kombis were assembled there by hand. After Juscelino Kubitschek's import substitution programs began taking effect, Volkswagen was compelled to open a proper factory in São Bernardo do Campo. Work on the factory began in mid-1957. Originally only the Kombi was built locally from September 1957, but from January 1959 the 1200 cc [...] "Fusca" [...] also entered local production, with ever growing local parts content. In 1959, VW started production at the plant near Sao Paolo.|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} of structural and aerodynamic modeling on multidisciplinary optimization in an aeroelastic environment {{are not well}} understood. Therefore, optimizations with flutter and frequency constraints were performed to investigate the effects these modeling factors have on various representative wings. To this end, the Automated Structural Optimization System (ASTROS) {{was used as a}} tool to minimize the weight of various <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> finite element wing models in subsonic and supersonic flow under given flutter and frequency constraints. First, the performance of the optimization module was tested against results from other codes on a straight and uniform wing widely used for optimization with flutter constraints. Then, <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> finite element models of various wings with different aspect ratios were investigated for the influence on the structural optimization for minimum weight of the following modeling factors: finite element selection, structural grid refinement; number of selected modes, retention of breathing modes; selection of reduced frequencies to be used in flutter analysis; aerodynamic panel size and placement; splining of the aerodynamic grid to the structural grid selection of extra points of the structural wing box for splining; and number of constraints to be retained. Knowledge of these influences {{as well as of the}} program behavior is important, since optimization can be made more efficient by the selection of reasonable initial models. Also, it was shown previously that modeling has an impact on the results of modal and aeroelastic analyses. Thus, if modeling errors can negatively affect the analyses, a minimum weight optimization can be jeopardized and result in an optimal design that is rather unreliable. In the following, selected results are presented and the {{influences of}} some modeling parameters on optimization are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} {{framework in}} Thailand regulating market access for global automobile firms aimed {{in particular to}} create and develop an industrial base in terms of component manufacturing and automobile assembly. The national regulatory framework included import substituting measures, such as a local content requirement (LCR), to force global automobile firms to use locally manufactured components for the assembly of imported completely knocked-down vehicles to benefit from much lower import tariffs as {{would be the case}} for the import of <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> vehicles. Therefore, with the increasing domestic demand for automobiles, this regulation also had the desired multiplier effects for Thailand’s industrialisation and national economic devel-opment.

40|$|Estimates of the {{recapitalisation}} {{needs of the}} euro-area banking system vary bet-ween € 50 and € 600 billion. The range shows the considerable uncertainty {{about the quality of}} banks ’ balance sheets and about the parameters of the forthcoming European Central Bank stress tests, including the treatment of sovereign debt and systemic risk. Uncertainty also prevails about the rules and discretion that will apply to bank recapitalisation, bank restructuring and bank resolution in 2014 and beyond. • The ECB should communicate the relevant parameters of its exercise early and in detail to give time to the private sector to find solutions. The ECB should establish itself as a tough supervisor and force non-viable banks into restructuring. This could lead to short-term financial volatility, but it should be weighed against the cost of a durably weak banking system and the credibility risk to the ECB. The ECB may need to provide large amounts of liquidity to the financial system. • Governments should support the ECB, accept cross-border bank mergers and sub-stantial creditor involvement under clear bail-in rules and should be prepared to reca-pitalise banks. Governments should agree on the eventual creation of a single resolution mechanism with efficient and fast decision-making procedures, and which can exercise discretion where necessary.

40|$|New {{investments}} in urban rail transport, both in Europe and North America, {{have been widely}} discussed in the transport policy literature, especially {{in the context of}} the relative success of individual projects. Recent experience in developed countries has seen something of a revival of urban light rail infrastructure, mainly because of its lower cost relative to full underground metro rail.

This paper reports on further progress on internationally funded comparative research first discussed at previous ERSA Conferences. It reports evidence (based on site visits) on the economic development impacts of new urban light rail.

40|$|Tripoli is {{the western}} capital of Libya and, {{is the largest}} urban centre in the whole country. The old city has evolved since Phoenician times, but grew {{gradually}} during the Roman and the Arab rules. It reached its ultimate stage of urban development {{at the end of}} the Ottoman rule, when the walled town of Tripoli was a <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> area. The urban development, of new Tripoli was initiated during the Italian rule when the central business district and part of the middle zone were developed for commercial and residential uses After the Independence of the country (1951) and recent oil development. The city began to experience a vast and rapid growth owing to various economic and social forces. Between 1954 and 1964 it nearly doubled in population partly through in-migration and partly through natural increase. Tripoli has important political and economic functions. The first is derived from the fact that the city is the western capital and the administrative centre of the Mugataa of Tripoli. The economic function is stronger than the political one, the growth of the shopping centre and central business district, together with the emergence of various industries within the city, are its most striking features. As a result of its growth, the city has begun to experience serious problems of transportation and traffic flow, shortage of housing, rise of rents, the emergence of the Shanty Town and other serious urban problems. Thus city planning and municipal programmes are of crucial importance to the city, in order to cope with the rapid growth of the population and expansion of housing development as well as to create better urban facilities and amenities "Mugataa" to indicate the province.
