50|$|The {{electrical}} equipment on the ER2 multiple units {{is similar to}} that of the late-model ER1s. Each power car has 4 traction motors connected in a series-parallel connection. The traction motor clamp voltage is controlled by means of starting resistances, as well as by changing the motors' connectivity and by field weakening. They are protected from electrical surges by various protective units: a fast-acting circuit breaker, an overload relay, a <b>differential</b> <b>relay,</b> etc. Early units also had a fuse in the traction motor circuit, but later units had more reliable protective equipment, which led to the fuse being removed as redundant.|$|E
50|$|Protection of {{traction}} motors from short circuits {{is accomplished by}} means of a fast-acting circuit breaker, which disconnects the traction circuit within 2-5 milliseconds if the current exceeds 575±25 amps. In case of a short to ground where the current does not exceed this level, protection is accomplished by a <b>differential</b> <b>relay</b> which compares current {{at both ends of the}} circuit and opens the circuit breaker if the difference in current exceeds 40 amps. The {{traction motors}} are also protected by a wheelslip relay which trips if the angular velocity of one of the traction motors significantly differs from the others (wheelslip, skidding, stripped gears, etc.) and an overload relay which trips if the current in a traction motor's circuit exceeds 265 amps; tripping of these relays automatically reduces the train's acceleration. The engineer's instrument panel has warning lights which illuminate when any of these relays trip (except for the differential relay—its action can be deduced from certain peculiarities in the tripping of the circuit breaker), and the tripping of the wheelslip relay also activates a warning bell.|$|E

We propose a conditional probability of error based approach, which can be used to regulate the erroneous relaying of data. Both AUS and PURS are able to achieve performance gains as compared to the direct transmission differential scheme in the case of selection relaying and incremental relaying protocols at high SNRs.

40|$|The {{increase}} of the fault current level is especially critical when additional generation capacity, e. g. distributed generation, is added close to a substation. Hence, in order to mitigate {{the severity of the}} fault currents, the installation of fault current limiter (FCL) devices appears as an attractive alternative. However, the use of FCL devices causes an unavoidable impact on the dynamics of the power system; consequently, the study of the interaction of FCLs with other equipment gains significance. This study examines the interaction between a FCL and the differential protection (DP), in detail, when integrating distributed generation into an already existing MV network. This interaction between FCL devices and DP has not yet been thoroughly studied. In order to carry out this study, initial results are obtained by computer simulation and validated by a real-time simulator connected to two units of <b>differential</b> <b>relays</b> (real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{how to provide}} standardized, current based, differential protection for any three-phase power transformer, including phase-shifting transformers with variable phase angle shift and transformers of all construction types and internal on-load tap-changer configurations. The use of standard transformer differential protection for such applications is considered impossible in the protective relaying standards and practices currently applied. The {{first part of the}} thesis provides the background for different types of power transformers and the differential protection schemes currently applied. After that a complete mathematical proof for the new, universal transformer differential protection principle, based on theory of symmetrical components, is derived. It is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} make numerical <b>differential</b> protection <b>relays</b> which can properly calculate differential currents for any power transformer, regardless of whether it is of fixed or variable phase angle shift construction and whether current magnitude variations are caused by on-load tapchanger(s). It is shown how to correctly calculate differential currents by simultaneously providing on-line compensation for current magnitude variations, on-line compensation for arbitrary phase angle shift variations and settable zero-sequence current reduction on any power transformer side. By using this method differential protection for arbitrary power transformers will be ideally balanced for all symmetrical and nonsymmetrical through-load conditions and external faults. The method is independent of individual transformer winding connection details (i. e. star, delta or zigzag), but dependent on having the correct information about actual on-load tap-changer(s) position if they are built-in within the protected power transformer. The implementation and practical use of this new universal principle is quite simple, as all necessary transformer data is commonly available on the protected power transformer rating plate. Practical application of the universal method for the differential protection of standard transformers, special transformers and phase shifting transformer is presented. Detailed testing of this new universal differential protection method is given and it is based on actual field recordings captured by numerical relays in existing phase-shifting transformer installations and on simulations from the Real Time Digital Simulator for a practical dual-core, symmetrical phaseshifting transformer. The implementation of the universal transformer differential method for analogue and numerical transformer <b>differential</b> <b>relays</b> is also described. Problems for the differential protection caused by transformer inrush currents are discussed. The mathematical relationship between differential protection and directional protection is derived. Then it is shown that through the addition of supplementary directional criteria security and speed of the operation of the transformer differential protection can be improved. Finally, the use of additional directional criteria to significantly improve the sensitivity of the differential protection for transformer winding turn-to-turn faults is suggested. Captured disturbance files from numerical <b>differential</b> <b>relays</b> in actual power transformer installations, during internal and external faults, have been used to demonstrate the performance of additional directional criteria...|$|R
