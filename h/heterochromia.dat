5|$|The semi-legendary Alexander Romance also {{suggests}} that Alexander suffered from <b>heterochromia</b> iridum: that one eye was dark and the other light.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, she {{revealed}} {{her struggle}} with chronic iritis {{that had caused}} temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had surgery that had corrected the problem. Kunis also has <b>heterochromia</b> iridum, {{a condition in which}} the irises are different colors. One eye (left) is brown, and the other (right) is green.|$|E
5|$|Bosworth {{was born}} on January 2, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. She is {{the only child of}} Patricia (née Potter), a homemaker, and Harold Bosworth, a former {{executive}} for Talbots. She was born with <b>heterochromia</b> iridum, and has a hazel right eye and a blue left eye. At the age of six, Bosworth's family relocated from San Francisco to various parts of the country due to her father's job. She was raised mainly on the East Coast, spending the rest of her youth in Massachusetts and Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had no regard for the health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with <b>heterochromia</b> iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the reproduction rate of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has <b>heterochromia,</b> though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance. Both Lucia and Sizuru have superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes in addition to their other abilities.|$|E

25|$|Affected persons may be {{identified}} by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, ambiguous genitalia and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or eye pigmentation (<b>heterochromia).</b> If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, genitals of both sexes may be formed: either ovary and testis, or combined ovotestes, in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as true hermaphroditism.|$|E
2500|$|... and [...] are a pair {{of small}} twin sisters. They wear {{matching}} dresses that sport rabbit motifs, pink and black hats, striped leggings, and very large sleeves, which conceal giant weapons. They also have <b>heterochromia</b> in their eyes in the reverse form of each other. Their twisted view of life leads them to treat killing {{as a way of}} [...] "having fun", even treating a bounty hunt as a game of tag. Luki, dressed mostly in black, has a large knife and throws smaller knives. Noki, dressed mostly in pink, has a machine gun. They are very agile, acrobatic, and have immense strength and regenerative ability. They refer to Heine and Giovanni as older [...] "brothers", and are afraid of their [...] "mother" [...] Einstürzen.|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (<b>heterochromia),</b> and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again. I could use a new centerpiece." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> {{of the eye}} (<b>heterochromia</b> iridis or <b>heterochromia</b> iridum) is {{of three}} kinds. In {{complete}} <b>heterochromia,</b> one iris is a different color from the other. In sectoral <b>heterochromia,</b> part of one iris is a different color from its remainder and finally in [...] "central heterochromia" [...] there are spikes of different colors radiating from the pupil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> (also {{known as}} a <b>heterochromia</b> iridis or <b>heterochromia</b> iridum) is an ocular {{condition}} in which one iris is a different color from the other iris (complete <b>heterochromia),</b> or where a part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial <b>heterochromia</b> or sectoral <b>heterochromia).</b> It {{is a result of}} the relative excess or lack of pigment within an iris or part of an iris, which may be inherited or acquired by disease or injury. This uncommon condition usually results due to uneven melanin content. A number of causes are responsible, including genetic, such as chimerism, Horner's syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Kattash {{is known}} to have different-coloured Irises, a {{condition}} known as <b>heterochromia</b> of the irises (<b>heterochromia</b> iridis).|$|E
50|$|In sectoral <b>heterochromia,</b> {{the iris}} {{contains}} two completely different {{colors in the}} same area. Sectoral <b>heterochromia</b> looks like an irregular spot that is a different color than the eye color and does not form a complete ring around the pupil like central <b>heterochromia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> is most {{prevalent}} in cats and dogs. Sectoral <b>heterochromia</b> {{is rare in}} humans; only about 1% of the population have it.http://www.heterochromiairidum.com/sectoral-heterochromia/ ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> is {{classified}} primarily by onset: as either genetic or acquired.Although a distinction is frequently made between <b>heterochromia</b> that affects an eye completely or only partially (sectoral <b>heterochromia),</b> {{it is often}} classified as either genetic (due to mosaicism or congenital) or acquired, with mention {{as to whether the}} affected iris or portion of the iris is darker or lighter. Most cases of <b>heterochromia</b> are hereditary, caused by certain diseases and syndromes. Sometimes one eye may change color following disease or injury.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> (also {{known as}} a <b>heterochromia</b> iridis or <b>heterochromia</b> iridum) is an ocular {{condition}} in which one iris is a different color from the other iris (complete <b>heterochromia),</b> or where the part of one iris is a different color from the remainder (partial <b>heterochromia</b> or sectoral <b>heterochromia).</b> Uncommon in humans, it is often an indicator of ocular disease, such as chronic iritis or diffuse iris melanoma, but may also occur as a normal variant. Sectors or patches of strikingly different colors in the same iris are less common. Alexander the Great and Anastasios the First were dubbed dikoro*s (dikoros, [...] "with two pupils") for their patent heterochromias. In their case, {{this was not a}} true dicoria (two pupils in the same iris). Real polycoria can be due to disease but is most often due to previous trauma or surgery.|$|E

50|$|Waardenburg {{syndrome}} - a syndrome {{in which}} <b>heterochromia</b> is {{expressed as a}} bilateral iris hypochromia in some cases. A Japanese review of 11 children with albinism found that the condition was present. All had sectoral/partial <b>heterochromia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{hypothesis}} about <b>heterochromia</b> {{is that it}} {{can result}} from a viral infection in utero affecting the development of one eye, possibly through some sort of genetic mutation. Occasionally, <b>heterochromia</b> can be a sign of a serious medical condition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterochromia</b> is a {{difference}} in coloration, usually of the iris but also of hair or skin. <b>Heterochromia</b> {{is a result of}} the relative excess or lack of melanin (a pigment). It may be inherited, or caused by genetic mosaicism, chimerism, disease, or injury.|$|E

50|$|Although {{infrequently}} seen in humans, complete <b>heterochromia</b> is {{more frequently}} observed in other species, where it almost always involves one blue eye. The blue eye occurs within a white spot, where melanin is {{absent from the}} skin and hair (see Leucism). These species include the cat, particularly breeds such as Turkish Van, Turkish Angora, Khao Manee and (rarely) Japanese Bobtail. These so-called odd-eyed cats are white, or mostly white, with one normal eye (copper, orange, yellow, green), and one blue eye. Among dogs, complete <b>heterochromia</b> is seen often in the Siberian Husky and few other breeds, usually Australian Shepherd and Catahoula Leopard Dog and rarely in Shih Tzu. Horses with complete <b>heterochromia</b> have one brown and one white, gray, or blue eye—complete <b>heterochromia</b> {{is more common in}} horses with pinto coloring. Complete <b>heterochromia</b> occurs also in cattle and even water buffalo. It can also be seen in ferrets with Waardenburg syndrome, although it can be very hard to tell at times as the eye color is often a midnight blue.|$|E
