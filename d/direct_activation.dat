5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. <b>Direct</b> <b>activation</b> of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through [...] or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter.

Amphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through an unidentified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux.

500|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>activation</b> of an AAC {{system is}} {{generally}} {{the first choice}} of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier. [...] Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or [...] "scanning". [...] In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch, vocalization or gesture. Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available: in [...] "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In [...] "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in [...] "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.|$|E

2500|$|Extrinsic apoptopic pathway: [...] The caspase cascade is also {{activated}} by extracellular ligands, via cell surface Death Receptors. This {{is done by}} the formation of a multiprotein Death Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) that recruits and activates a pro-caspase. For example, the Fas Ligand binds the FasR receptor at the receptor's extracellular surface; this activates the death domains at the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The adaptor protein FADD will recruit (by a Death domain-Death domain interaction). The other end of the adaptor contains a DED domain for pro-caspase recruitment. This FasR, FADD and pro-Caspase 8 form the Death Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) where Caspase-8 is activated. This could lead to either downstream activation of the intrinsic pathway by inducing mitochondrial stress, or <b>direct</b> <b>activation</b> of Executioner Caspases (Caspase 3, Caspase 6 and Caspase 7) to degrade cellular components as shown in the adjacent diagram.|$|E

40|$|The Myc {{transcription}} factor {{is a potent}} inducer of proliferation and is required for Wnt/-catenin signaling in intestinal epithelium. Since deregulation of the Wnt/-catenin pathway {{is a prerequisite for}} nonhereditary intestinal tumorigenesis, we asked whether activation of Myc recapitulates the tumorigenic changes that are driven by constitutive Wnt/-catenin pathway signaling following adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) inactiva-tion. Using mice in which expression of MycERTAM, a reversibly switchable form of Myc, is expressed transgenically in intestinal epithelium, we define the acute changes that follow Myc activation as well as subsequent deactivation. Myc activation reversibly recapitulates many, but not all, aspects of APC inactivation, including increased proliferation and apoptosis and loss of goblet cells. However, whereas APC inactivation induces redistribution of Paneth cells, <b>direct</b> Myc <b>activation</b> triggers their rapid attrition. Moreover, <b>direct</b> Myc <b>activation</b> engages the ARF/p 53 /p 21 cip 1 tumor suppressor pathway, whereas deregulation of Wnt/-catenin signaling does not.

50|$|The sgRNA is {{engineered}} with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in {{the sequence}} outside of the targeting sequence. In {{the development of the}} technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a lentiviral vector.To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of luciferase and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a transcription activator assay was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) (<b>Direct</b> <b>activation)</b> or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA (Bridged activation). Reporter gene activation through <b>direct</b> <b>activation</b> imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed <b>direct</b> <b>activation</b> except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.|$|E

40|$|UBF is a DNA binding protein which {{interacts with}} both the {{promoter}} and the enhancer of various vertebrate ribosomal RNA genes and functions as a transcription initiation factor for RNA polymerase I (pol I). We have purified murine UBF to apparent molecular homogeneity and demonstrate that its transactivating potential, but not its DNA binding activity, is modulated in response to cell growth. In vivo labelling experiments demonstrate that UBF is a phosphoprotein and that the phosphorylation state is different in growing and quiescent cells. We show that UBF is phosphorylated in vitro by a cellular protein kinase which by several criteria closely resembles casein kinase II (CKII). A major modification involves serine phosphoesterifications in the carboxy terminal hyperacidic tail of UBF.
