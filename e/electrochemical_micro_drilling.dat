Experiments with different ultrasonic frequencies, amplitudes and rotational speeds were conducted and the influences of these parameters on thrust force were investigated. With the thrust force data from these experiments, a correlation study to the simulation results based on the force model is carried out. The study identifies the limitations on the current one dimensional force model and leads to recommendations for the further development of the force model. Further work is identified for both modelling and experiments, and the present models can be expanded to suit the research and development of UAMD techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Manufacture of micro {{holes in}} difficult-to-machine {{material}} is very difficult, electro-chemical machining (ECM) {{is one of}} the more appropriate approach. However, micro holes fabricated using ECM can have different diameters at the entrances and exits and such tapering effect is not localized. In this work, a new ECM method named electro-chemical <b>micro</b> <b>drilling</b> (ECMD) for machining high quality straight micro holes in difficult-to-machine material was introduced, and the micro-spherical electrode fabricated by a hybrid technique combining micro-ECM with one pulse electro discharge (OPED) was used in ECMD process. Micro-spherical electrode and ultra short pulses (tens of nanosecond scale) were used to locally dissolve the area with the effect of voltage, pulse width and pulse frequency on the localization distance being studied. High quality micro holes with a diameter of 42 µm in a 70 µm thick nickel foil were drilled using micro-spherical electrode with a sphere diameter of 30 µm...|$|R

Drilling {{is one of the}} most fundamental machining technologies and is moving toward high precision/high speed application for productivity enhancement. The drill tools play a critical role is increasing the productivity of a cutting process. Although the price of a cutting tool itself is relatively low, the costs caused by tool failures are considerably higher. Therefore, from the viewpoint of cost and productivity, modelling and optimization of <b>drilling</b> processes are <b>micro</b> <b>drilled</b> holes are utilized in many of today’s fabrication processes. Precision production processes in industries are trending toward the use of smaller holes with higher aspect ratios, and higher speed operation for <b>micro</b> hole <b>drilling.</b> Experiment was conducted on FR- 2 as a work piece material using carbide drill having 0. 7 mm diameter. FR- 2 sheet with copper foil lamination on one or both sides is widely used to build low-end consumer electronic equipment. In the present work, spindle speed and feed are chosen as machining parameter to see the effect of circularity and taper angle on workpiece. Usingtaguchi methodology, L 27 orthogonal array has been chosen and experiment has been performed as per orthogonal array design. For validation of the predicted value and optimization result, confirmation experiments have been performed with optimum levels of machining parameters. It is experimentally found that spindle speed is more influencing parameter for hole quality in terms of circularity and taper angle...|$|R
