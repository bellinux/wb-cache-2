2500|$|Portman {{signed a}} {{contract}} to play Padmé in the three prequel films. Reactions by critics to her performances were mixed. James Berardinelli called her acting in The Phantom Menace [...] "effective," [...] but Annlee Ellingson of Box Office Magazine said [...] "Portman's delivery is stiff and flat, perhaps hindered by the gorgeous but cumbersome costumes." [...] Mike Clark of USA Today complained about Portman and Hayden Christensen, claiming, [...] "Both speak in monotone for doubly deadly effect, though when not burdened by his co-star, Christensen often finds the emotion in his limited intonations." [...] A Revenge of the Sith reviewer for The Village Voice accused [...] "computer-generated characters like wheezing cyborg baddie General Grievous and blippeting <b>fireplug</b> R2-D2" [...] of [...] "emot more convincingly than either Natalie Portman or Hayden Christensen." [...] Nonetheless, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described Portman's performance in the third episode as [...] "decorative and sympathetic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Jim Grobe {{took over}} an Ohio {{program that was}} in great need of an overhaul. He brought with him a unique {{offensive}} and defensive philosophy learned as a long-time assistant coach at the United States Air Force Academy. While most of the college football world was moving towards a high-octane passing attack, Grobe took the Bobcats back to the basics of the triple option, with wildly successful results. Ohio scored over 300 points in both 1996 and 1997, going 8-3 in 1997. It was the Green and White's first winning season in 15 years. Grobe's squads were prolific offensive teams, {{in spite of the}} media's ill-conceived notion of an [...] "antique" [...] offense. Kareem Wilson, the Bobcats' <b>fireplug</b> of a quarterback, was voted the MAC's Offensive Player of the Year following a 1996 season in which he rushed for 1,072 yards and a school-record 14 touchdowns. Meanwhile, fullback Steveland Hookfin was piling up 3,972 rushing yards during the same era to become Ohio's all-time rushing leader. Wilson's total of 3,597 yards still stands as the fifth-most ever by an NCAA quarterback. His 875 career carries are the most by a signal caller in college football history.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, the Maier family {{sold the}} house to USC’s Pi Kappa Alpha {{fraternity}} for $20,000 – about 13% of the original cost of construction. [...] In {{their first year of}} occupancy, the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity put Stimson House {{at the center of a}} near riot among USC students. [...] Members of a UCLA fraternity prematurely set the traditional USC bonfire ablaze early in the morning before the scheduled event. [...] Two of the UCLA students were captured by members of the USC fraternity and returned to Stimson House. [...] In response to the acts of the UCLA students, 800 Trojans set fires in the streets with makeshift piles of sticks, boxes, crates, wooden benches and anything that would burn. [...] When firemen arrived, a [...] "solid wall of undergraduates" [...] blocked their access to the nearest <b>fireplug.</b> [...] Firemen doused the students with their fire hoses, and police unsheathed their billy clubs to avert a riot. [...] Two hours later, the two captured UCLA students were displayed to reporters [...] "imprisoned in the 'catacombs'" [...] of Stimson House. [...] The two young men had been stripped of their clothing, their bodies smeared with black paint, and on the chest of each was written the letters [...] "S.C." [...] Their heads had also been shaved, leaving only a topknot [...] with a circle of black paint creating the appearance of an Iroquois Indian. [...] Both had been spanked until sitting was uncomfortable, and the two were [...] "guarded in their cell by more than 100 husky Trojans." [...] One of the captured UCLA students was the son of Los Angeles Police Chief Hohmann who said, [...] "Bob (his son) got himself into this, and he’ll have to take his medicine." ...|$|E

50|$|On December 11, 1892, the Denver & Rio Grande's Salida {{shops and}} {{roundhouse}} caught fire. The fire {{started in the}} waste box in the cab of D&RG No.419 and spread to the oil-soaked floor. Due to the city's <b>fireplugs</b> being shut off because of cold weather, the shop burned to the ground, taking the 223 with it. The 223 was rebuilt soon after and placed back in service.|$|R

5000|$|... "In June 1938, their {{creation}} launches in Action Comics. Nobleman details this achievement with a zest amplified by MacDonald's punchy illustrations, {{done in a}} classic litho palette of brassy gold, antique blue and <b>fireplug</b> red. MacDonald's Depression-era vignettes picture Siegel pondering his superhero's powers and the friends casting a single, caped shadow. A cautionary afterword chronicles their protracted financial struggles with DC Comics--when Siegel and Shuster sold their first Superman story, they also sold all rights to the character, for $130." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, Kroll {{had a voice}} role as villainous mad {{scientist}} Professor Poopypants in the DreamWorks animated superhero film Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. Although {{many critics}} only either mentioned his character in passing, some pointing out his similarities with Albert Einstein, or his [...] "committed" [...] performance, Matt Zoller Seitz took particular note of his work, praising it as [...] "irrepressibly silly" [...] with [...] "an orange juice spit-take voice". Seitz further stated that [...] "the way Kroll savors every syllable of his alternately peevish, self-pitying and nonsensical dialogue—aided mightily by the animators, who've given the character a <b>fireplug</b> body and a waddling walk—transforms the ridiculous into the sublime." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1988, Mushing {{magazine}} began {{publication in}} Ester {{and continued to}} be produced and published there until it was sold in 2005. The town became {{the site of a}} sled dog stage race between Ester and Nenana and back again, the <b>Fireplug</b> Sled Dog Race, which was held for ten years, from 1990 to 2001, and in which many famous mushers participated, including Dean Seibold and Jeff King. In January 1999, the town's first newspaper, The Ester Republic, was founded. In August 1999 the John Trigg Ester Library opened, a membership library named after a local resident who had started a book exchange in a nearby bar. Today the town features two saloons, five publishers, a library, a fire station, the post office, a silversmith, numerous art studios, and three active gold mines.|$|E
50|$|Reliance {{was founded}} in 1817, officially {{incorporating}} in 1820, as the Fire Association of Philadelphia, organized by 5 hose and 11 engine fire companies. Upon inception, Reliance became the nation's first successful association of volunteer fire departments, which beforehand had been independent of one another and often engaged in inefficient competition, which at times extended {{to the destruction of}} rivals' equipment and the assault of rival firefighters. In addition to underwriting fire insurance, the association served as mediator between its member engine and hose companies to resolve the problems of the past. The association's first policy was bought by Samuel Bleight for his three-story building. One lasting symbol of the company adopted at the outset was the fire mark featuring a <b>fireplug</b> with a coiling hose and the initials F.A. on both sides.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Ricketts' {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For {{extraordinary and}} distinguished gallantry {{above and beyond}} the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge of the Engineering Repair Party of the U.S.S. Yorktown in action against enemy Japanese forces in the Battle of the Coral Sea on 8 May 1942. During the severe bombarding of the Yorktown by enemy Japanese forces, an aerial bomb passed through and exploded directly beneath the compartment in which Lt. Ricketts' battle station was located, killing, wounding or stunning all of his men and mortally wounding him. Despite his ebbing strength, Lt. Ricketts promptly opened the valve of a near-by <b>fireplug,</b> partially led out the fire hose and directed a heavy stream of water into the fire before dropping dead beside the hose. His courageous action, which undoubtedly prevented the rapid spread of fire to serious proportions, and his unflinching devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

Officer W. J. Marshall said Nell Knight Kerns, 60, of 1017 N. McKinley, driver of the station wagon, apparently escaped serious injury but was taken to Wesley Hospital for chest X - rays. Marshall said the auto involved in the collision was knocked on its side and landed upright 68 feet from the point of impact. the driver, Warner E. Keenan, 24, of 1001 N. Olie, was not injured.

40|$|One of {{the cool}} things about being in the Regional Office is that I get to go around and visit people on their units. Usually {{everyone}} is really nice and I get {{to see a lot}} of cool plants. Another thing that entertains me while I’m travelling is seeing how people decorate their workspace. Not everyone has an office, or even a cubicle of their own, but almost everyone decorates. It’s the dog and <b>fireplug</b> thing. Pinecones are very popular items, and not just among the botanists. The most popular (or the most sought-after) seems to be the behemoth Pinus coulteri. But pinecones are like bottle-openers or socks; they can be nice to look at but they have an inescapably utilitarian veil. What I like to see on botanists ’ desks are the dry flower stems and the fragments of nonvascular plants. We take pride in little sticks and twigs bearing unidentifiable flowers, the remnants of long-shattered seed-heads, a thorny Crataegus stem with raisiny old pomes, or a twisty Xyris culm. And don’t we love our lichens and mosses. My computer is littered with schists, quartzites, and basalts, each festooned with contrasting orange, yellow, green, and black lichens. We bring this debris indoors to remind us of who we are while working on special use permits, EA’s, and Gordzilla, to remind us through the winter that field season will almost certainly return, and mostly to invoke memories of glories past.
