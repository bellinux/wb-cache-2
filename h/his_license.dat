5|$|The {{renewal of}} <b>his</b> <b>license</b> {{was due to}} the fact that while there is a central {{registry}} of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors, no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic.

5|$|Adams {{followed}} the usual course {{of reading the}} law {{in order to obtain}} <b>his</b> <b>license</b> to practice.

In 1758, he earned an A.M. from Harvard, and the following year was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary, which included his report of the 1761 argument of James Otis Jr. in the Massachusetts Superior Court as to the legality of Writs of Assistance. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the American colonies.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting <b>his</b> <b>license</b> back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
