5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot {{concerns}} a diminutive prince {{on a mission}} to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were accidentally destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a star. Katamari Damacys story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world sandbox {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective.

25|$|For this to happen, the resin must be {{resistant}} to decay. Many trees produce resin, {{but in the}} majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes.

25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
25|$|Hameroff {{provided}} a hypothesis that microtubules would be suitable hosts for quantum behavior. Microtubules {{are composed of}} tubulin protein dimer subunits. The dimers each have hydrophobic pockets that are 8nm apart and that may contain delocalized pi electrons. Tubulins have other smaller non-polar regions that contain pi electron-rich indole rings separated by only about 2nm. Hameroff proposed that these electrons are close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> entangled. Hameroff originally suggested the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a Bose–Einstein condensate, but this was discredited. He then proposed a Frohlich condensate, a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was experimentally discredited.|$|E
