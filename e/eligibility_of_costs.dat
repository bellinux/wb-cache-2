40|$|In this Note, the Author uses In re Guardianship of Domey (2008) to {{highlight}} {{the problems associated with}} Medicaid <b>eligibility,</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> long-term care, and any duty of a guardian to their ward relating to Medicaid eligibility and the protection of assets for distribution to others. The Author argues that imposing a duty on guardians to propose Medicaid spend-downs is necessary to achieve adequate protection for the ward facing an indefinite term of long-term care. The Note provides background on Medicaid, nursing home care <b>costs,</b> and methods <b>of</b> financing nursing home care through both private-pay and government benefits. Additionally, the background on the current Medicaid transfer laws, Medicaid planning strategies, and an overview of Medicaid planning initiated by guardians are discussed. An appendix provides a sampling of each state’s guardian statutes and cases discussing guardian-initiated estate planning and Medicaid spend-downs...|$|R
40|$|Exploited {{fish and}} {{shellfish}} stocks in European marine waters underlie the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The next round of reform of the CFP is due for completion in 2012. The exploitation at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) may be confirmed as the common environmental objective for good environment status (GES) of exploited {{fish and shellfish}} stocks of the reformed CFP and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The foreseen time horizon to achieve or maintain GES by 2020 appears inconsistent with the World Summit on Sustainable Development UN agreement in 2002, which stipulates that maintenance or restoring of stocks to produce MSY be realized by 2015. The MSFD requires instead that by 2015 the national programmes of measures be designed {{in order to become}} operational the following year (2016). The MSFD significantly strengthens Member States' competences and responsibilities to maintain or achieve GES for all exploited fish and shellfish stocks inside territorial waters and the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) with common goals. This will inevitably guide future European Fisheries Council decisions towards long term objectives even at regional levels instead of short term national socio-economic concerns. With such provisions, MSFD is thought to foster and harmonise European fisheries management with ecosystem approaches. For reasons of simplification, the future revision of the CFP should cover all exploited fish and shellfish stocks in all European Seas including territorial zones and EEZs. Member States will need to prepare both for the increased scientific advisory and monitoring efforts expected. The <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> additional <b>costs</b> for the Data Collection Framework (DCF) needs to be discussed and decided as soon as these costs are identified and quantified by the competent authorities.

40|$|Policymakers face {{mounting}} pressures from consumer demand and the 1999 Olmstead Supreme Court decision to extend formal (paid) programs that deliver personal {{care to the}} elderly, chronically ill, and disabled. Despite this, very {{little is known about}} the largest program that delivers personal care: the Medicaid State Plan personal care services (PCS) optional benefit. This paper presents the latest available national program (participant and expenditure) trend data (1999 – 2002) on the Medicaid PCS benefit and findings from a national survey <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> and <b>cost</b> control policies in use on the program. The program trends show that, over the study period, the number of states providing the Medicaid PCS benefit grew by four (from 26 to 30), and national program participation, adjusted for population growth, increased by 27 %. However, inflation-adjusted program expenditures per participant declined by 3 % between 1999 and 2002. Findings from the policy survey reveal that between 1999 and 2002 there was a marked decline in the range of services provided, and by 2004, almost half the programs operated a cap on the hours of services provided...|$|R

40|$|Several {{states are}} {{pursuing}} policies to foster renewable energy {{as part of}} efforts to restructure state electric power markets.

Spousal Medicare eligibility also has large impacts on the source of coverage for privately-insured, Medicare-ineligible spouses, but has no effect on the health care use or labor market participation of ineligible spouses...|$|R
