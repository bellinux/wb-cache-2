40|$|Leaf {{instruments}} have {{occupied a}} post-European contact role in constituting Australian societal networks, and their epistemologies reflect native/exotic binaries in the species selected by Indigenous and non-Indigenous musicians respectively. Accordingly, this essay examines some musical applications of native plant {{populations in the}} construction of arboreally-based cultural heritages and social traditions in the southeastern Aboriginal societies. In a broad characterisation of the practices of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>leaf</b> players (“leafists”), it extends the actor-network framework of “reaching out to a plant” established by John C. Ryan in 2012. When leafists play tunes on plants—either at their own source, or on leaves intentionally plucked for performance—music furnishes an intimate and vital part of their reflection to and from the nonhuman world. The author conceptualises eucalypt leaf instruments (“gumleaves”) as actants and iconic sensors of place, providing further evidence for their role as conduits between land and people in some cultural blendings and positionings with art, drama, and poetry. This interrogation of confluences between musicians and Australian land and plants works towards more nuanced understandings of the complex interlinked systems of music, ecology, nature, and societies...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove has as an {{important}} role in the coastal area. Thus, it must be managed properly. An experiment on its management was carried out in Morodemak villages, Bonang subdistrict, Demak district, central Java Province. Sheep owned by the fisherman were used as a material of the experiment. These were taking using purposive random sampling method. Sample was chosen from three different locations. It was determined on the basis of the distance from farmer housing to the mangrove areas. It was divided into three categories, namely: close: 0 - 2 km; medium: 2 - 4 km; and distant: > 4 km). survey was done in order to collect data on mangrove, management system, and status of hematology (triglyceride and protein total of plasma blood) of sheep. The experiment was conducted by managing the sheep traditionally by giving them <b>indigenous</b> grass and <b>leaf</b> mangrove. There was no difference in the content of triglyceride and protein total of plasma blood of sheep managed at three different areas. This phenomenon occurred due to only the quality of leaf of mangrove, which has been fed to the sheep...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} emerging context of Indigenous planning, recognizing that it is both a theoretical framework and professional practice of resistance to historical colonial planning and the production of place/space relationships. Specifically my thesis employs an Indigenous research framework, whereby the participants are experts, respect for relationships is foremost and contribution to social change is part of the design (Smith, 1999). Through the use of Photovoice (Castleden & Garvin, 2008 Wang & Burris, 1997) as a participatory research framework of qualitative inquiry, participants examine place/space relationships between Lheidli T'enneh Nation Members and Lheidli (the now City of Prince George) in the specific contexts of (1) the colonial hegemony that has erased Lheidli history and (2) the wider neglect of planning policy in not meaningfully engaging with urban Aboriginal communities. Ultimately my thesis does not transcend Western research methods rather, it creates a political challenge to the Western model of the planning process by acknowledging an Indigenous planning methodology that is accountable to <b>Indigenous</b> communities.

40|$|Induced {{resistance}} to bacterial leaf blight disease in rice field by <b>indigenous</b> rhizobacteria. Bacterial <b>leaf</b> blight {{is the most}} important disease on paddy at Southeast Sulawesi. Utilization of biological agents that induce plant resistance is an alternative tool to control bacterial leaf blight disease on paddy. The aim of the experiment was obtain rhizobacteria that were able to stimulate the growth of paddy plants as well induce plant {{resistance to}}wards bacterial leaf blight in the field. All experiment units were arranged with a factorial design in a randomized complete block design. The first factor was the rhizobacteria isolates, consisting 4 treatments, i. e: without rhizobacteria (R 0), isolate P 11 a (R 1), isolate PKLK 5 (IR 2), and mixture P 11 a and PKLK 5 (R 3), the second factor is paddy varieties, (V 1) : IR 64 variety, (V 2) : Cisantana variety. The pathogen was inoculated on leaf when 45 day after crop. Weekly observation of disease severity, vegetative plant growth (leaf and stem numbers), and yield were conducted. The results showed that the 10 isolates of rhizobacteria tested were able to induce plant resistance toward bacterial leaf blight, stimulated vegetative growth as well as increased yield of paddy plant. Rhizobacteria application could increase the resistance of paddy toward Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The application rhizobacteria could increase the vegetative plant growth, application mixture P 11 a and PKLK 5 isolates showed higher resistance than single application in terms of plant growth and yield, both IR 64 and Cisantana variete...|$|R
40|$|The protencial {{of partial}} {{replacement}} of fish meal protein with protein <b>indigenous</b> <b>leaf</b> meals in practical diets for milkfish, Chanos chanos (Forsskal) was studied. Five isocaloric (375 kcal/ 100 g diet), isonitrogenous (40 % protein), and isolipidic (10 %) diets were formulated to contain leaf meals from either swamp cabbage (kangkong, Ipomea reptans), sweet potato (kamote, Ipomea batatas), ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala), and cassava (kamorng kahoy, Manihot esculenta), {{or a combination}} of swamp cabbage, sweet potato and cassava. The control diet contained fish meal and soybean meal as sources of protein while thw test diets contained fish meal, soybean meal, and leaf meals erplacing 15 % of the fish meal protein. The protein sources were incorporated in levels that gives optimal essential amino acid patterns to the diets. Each diet was fed to reiplcate groups of fish (about 0. 3 g) maintained at 20 ppt salinity and 29 o C in a recirculating system for twelve weeks. Growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival of fish fed the diet contaning cassava leaf meal showed the best groth FCR, PER and survival. the data sugest that these leaf meals can be used to partially replace fish meal in a diet for juvenile milkfish if the requirments for essential amino acids are met...|$|E
40|$|Decontamination {{treatments}} of burning and biocide application, alone and {{in combination with}} tillage, were evaluated {{for their ability to}} reduce populations of bacteria applied to the leaves of plants in field plots. In addition, the effects of these control methods on <b>indigenous</b> <b>leaf</b> and soil bacteria and fungi were assessed. Field plots of bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), sprayed with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, or Erwinia herbicola, received the following treatments: (i) control, (ii) tillage, (iii) burning, (iv) burning plus tillage (burn-tillage), (v) Kocide (cupric hydroxide), (vi) Kocide plus tillage, (vii) Agri-Strep (streptomycin sulfate), and (viii) Agri-Strep plus tillage. Leaves and soil from the plots were sampled at 1 day before and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 30 days after application of the decontamination treatments. The burn and burn-tillage treatments produced the most significant reductions in bacterial populations. The Agri-Strep treatment was more effective than the Kocide treatment in eliminating applied bacteria, but neither biocide produced consistent or persistent control. In contrast, the tillage treatment, alone or in combination with the Agri-Strep or Kocide treatments, had a short-term stimulatory effect and increased populations of applied bacteria and also levels of indigenous fungi and bacteria. Agri-Strep and Kocide treatments caused significant reductions in indigenous bacterial populations up to 14 days after application and in indigenous fungal populations on day 7 after application. Our results suggest that conventional plant disease control methods may not provide satisfactory control of genetically engineered microorganisms and indicate a need for further development of effective and selective methods to control release microorganisms at field sites...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella {{are capable}} of causing {{gastrointestinal}} illness if ingested with food. There is an urgent need within the food processing industry to improve the efficiency of both the sanitising processes used on fresh produce and the microbiological methods used to ensure its safety. The aims {{of this study were}} to develop novel microscopic methods to detect and quantify both <b>indigenous</b> <b>leaf</b> bacteria and viable human pathogens on salad leaves, without the need for recovery and culture, which may reduce the accuracy of quantification. The methods developed could then be used to quantify the number of indigenous and inoculated bacteria in situ on salad leaves as well as to identify factors affecting the quantity and spatial patterning of attachment. In addition, the efficacy of chemical biocides for the reduction of viable Salmonella on salad leaves was considered. Episcopic Differential Interference Contrast (EDIC) microscopy coupled with epifluorescence was used to rapidly and non-destructively view the natural microflora in situ on spinach leaves. Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson was inoculated onto spinach leaves in order to observe spatial and temporal patterning of colonisation under differing conditions. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mutants defective in curli fimbriae production were used to assess the role of curli in attachment to abiotic surfaces and leaves. Viability determination of potential viable but non-culturable (VNC), sub-lethally stressed cells was performed to assess the effect of chemical wash treatments on Salmonella attached to fresh spinach. The results obtained indicate that salad leaves are densely populated with naturally occurring bacteria; these are found predominantly in the margins between leaf epidermal cells as well as around leaf veins and stomata. Cells were present in complex three-dimensional aggregations, suggesting the presence of biofilms. Curli fimbriae were shown to be key in the attachment of Salmonella typhimurium to polystyrene but not to leaf surfaces. When Salmonella thompson was inoculated onto spinach leaves and then subjected to chemical washing in chlorine or Citrox, neither chemical was an effective biocide against the pathogen. Under-reporting of viable cell numbers by plate counting methods indicated that chlorine induced a viable but nonculturable (VNC) state amongst Salmonella. These findings have important implications for the sanitisation of salads; both stomatal penetration and the formation of biofilms could protect enteric bacteria on leaves from chemical and mechanical disinfection strategies. If human pathogens are able to spread to salad leaves from contaminated soil, irrigation water or directly from animal faeces, and actively penetrate the interior of the leaves, then the microbiological safety of ready-to-eat salads cannot be guaranteed. This study also suggests that current methods for detection of pathogenic bacteria in foods following processing may be under-reporting the threat to consumers due to the induction of the VNC state amongst pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|The {{increase}} in foodborne outbreaks worldwide attributed to {{fresh fruit and}} vegetables suggests that produce may serve as an ecological niche for enteric pathogens. Here we examined the interaction of E. coli O 157 :H 7 (EcO 157) with spinach <b>leaf</b> <b>indigenous</b> microorganisms during co-colonization and establishment of a mixed biofilm on a stainless steel surface. Stainless steel surface was selected to mimic the surface of produce-processing equipment, where retention of foodborne pathogens such as EcO 157 could serve as a potential source for transmission. We observed a positive effect of spinach-associated microbes on the initial attachment of EcO 157, but an antagonistic effect on the EcO 157 population at the later stage of biofilm formation. Metagenomic analyses of the biofilm community with the GeoChip revealed an extremely diverse community (gene richness, 23409; Shannon-Weiner index H, 9. 55). Presence of EcO 157 in the mixed biofilm resulted in a significant decrease in the community a-diversity (t test, P, 0. 05), indicating a putative competition between the pathogen and indigenous spinach microbes. The decrease in the b-diversity of the EcO 157 -inoculated biofilm at 48 h (ANOVA, P, 0. 05) suggested a convergent shift in functional composition in response to EcO 157 invasion. The success of EcO 157 in the mixed biofilm is likely associated with its metabolic potential in utilizing spinach nutrients: the generation time of EcO 157 in spinach lysates at 28 uC is, 38 min, which is comparable to that in rich broth. The significant decrease i...|$|R
