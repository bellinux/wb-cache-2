40|$|A {{depression}} in antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) measured {{both in terms}} of circulating antibody and plaque-forming cells in the spleen was observed in CFW mice infected with M. lepraemurium when sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HGG) were used as antigens. The impairment in AMI was evident only after 75 days of infection thereafter the antibody response to SRBC antigen progressively decreased until the last day of experimentation (135 days). Within the first 60 days of infection no alteration in AMI was observed with the HGG antigen while the response to the SRBC antigen was significantly higher in the infected animals than in uninfected controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{rheumatoid}} sera to support concanavalin-A transformation of normal lymphocytes was {{inversely related to}} serum C 1 q binding activity. When C 1 q binding activity of the sera was removed by absorption with staphylococcal protein A, subsequent lymphocyte response increased to the level found in immune-complex negative sera. Gel filtration of {{a small number of}} sera suggested that the suppressive material had a molecular weight in the range 1. 8 - 4. 9 x 10 (5) daltons. Aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> suppressed con-A transformation of normal lymphocytes in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that immune complexes present in rheumatoid sera can suppress lymphocyte responsiveness.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of lymphocytes and epithelial cells from the murine gastric mucosa has been developed. Gastric lymphocytes were stimulated by T-cell mitogens in vitro. When mice were sensitized systemically with <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HGG) and given the antigen orally 4 days before cell isolation, both the number of mucosal lymphocytes and their capacity to incorporate [3 H]thymidine ([3 H]TdR) was enhanced. Gastric epithelial cells added to cultures of syngeneic spleen cells enhanced both phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) responsiveness and mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) in low numbers, but significantly suppressed these responses at high concentrations. These findings suggest that gastric lymphocytes, {{like those of the}} gut, are involved in the immune response against antigens taken in by mouth, and that there may be in vivo interactions between gastric mucosa lymphocytes and epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Membrane {{activation}} of human neutrophils by preformed immune complexes and heat aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulins</b> was studied by chemiluminescence. Strong neutrophil activa-tion {{was found with}} human-albumin rabbit-antialbumin complexes prepared at equivalence, with maximal activation occurring in slight antigen excess. Furthermore different preparations of heat aggregated gammaglobulin which were of large size also showed similar activity. In contrast, heat aggregates of small size were inactive and blocked the chemiluminescent response found with larger active aggregates. A purified monoclonal rheumatoid factor with specificity for IgG mod-ulated these responses when preincubated with preformed complexes or aggregates. Both enhancement of the neutrophil chemiluminescence response with inactive preparations and sup-pression of the response with highly active preparations were observed. Kinetic studies of the neutrophil chemiluminescent response varied {{with respect to the}} activating preparation, but were generally biphasic. This observation suggested an initial direct membrane activation followed by a more delayed response reflecting phagocytosis of complexes.

40|$|A {{total of}} 190 {{selected}} serum samples from 30 kidney graft recipients obtained in temporal {{connection with the}} first occurrence of CMV-pp 65 -antigen positive leukocytes or IgM-anti-CMV-antibodies were analysed by immunoblot (IB) in a blinded manner. In all sera the number of IgG, IgM and IgA specificities against 8 defined CMV polypeptides {{and the intensity of}} reactions were measured. In 12 pretransplant CVM-IgG-EIA(Abbott) -positive recipients antibodies to 150, 78 and 65 kD polypeptides were detectable in 100 % of the patients, followed by antibodies to 52 and 38 kD polypeptides in 83 % and finally antibodies to 60, 42 and 28 kD polypeptides in 50 â€“ 58 % of the patients. The strongest reactions were seen against the 150 kD polypeptide. In 7 out of 18 patients (38. 9 %) of the pretransplant CMV-IgG-EIA-negative group antibodies to 65 kD polypeptide could be detected by IB. Therefore, the grouping of recipients as CMV antibody positive or negative strongly depends on the test system used. After prophylactic or therapeutic use of <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulins</b> all recipients became blot positive immediately after infusion. The strongest reaction intensities were found against the 150 kD polypeptide followed by 52, 65 and 38 kD. In 12 recipients suffering from primary CMV infection IgM responses to 65, 52 and 38 kD polypeptides were found in 100 %. Most recipients developed also an IgM response to the 150 kD glycoprotein in the course of infection. All recipients with a positive IgM reaction also produced IgA-anti-CMV- antibodies at the same time. The strongest reaction was directed against the 65 kD polypeptide, followed by reactions against 52, 38 and 150 kD polypeptides. With respect to the time point of antigen detection in peripheral blood leukocytes we observed both an increase in number of blot positive recipients and an increase in reaction intensity immediately after occurrence of pp 65 positive leukocytes. Remarkable IgM as well as IgA activities were directed against 65, 52 and 38 kD polypeptides. All 12 recipients suffering from CMV reactivation produced IgM responses to 150, 52 and 38 kD polypeptide, most recipients also to 78, 65, 42 and 28 kD polypeptides. All recipients with a positive IgM reaction produced at the same time also IgA-anti-CMV-antibodies. The strongest reaction was directed against the 65 kD polypeptide, followed by reactions to 52, 38 and 150 kD polypeptides. It is worth noticing that in about 70 % of recipients suffering from CMV reactivations IgM-antibodies to 150, 52 and 42 kD polypeptides and IgA-antibodies to 52 kD polypeptide could be detected at the time of or shortly before the pp 65 test became positive. Therefore, the blotting technique is a valuable and very sensitive tool for detailed characterizing of the CMV antibody status of graft recipients...|$|R
40|$|Heat-aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit the random {{migration}} of human neutrophils in serum-containing medium. This inhibition was not due to metabolic exhaustion or deactivation of the cells, since migration in the presence of aggregated gammaglobulin and casein as a chemotactic stimulus was not inhibited. The inhibition of migration was not mediated by a negative chemotactic gradient produced as a result of complement activation, and could be demonstrated in complement-depleted serum. Sera obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis with evidence of circulating immune complexes were able to significantly inhibit neutrophil migration, indicating that this phenomenon may be a useful means for the detection of circulating immune complexes. It is suggested that aggregated gammaglobulin or immune complexes can inhibit the chemokinetic effect of serum on neutrophils by a reversible interaction with the neutrophil surface, and that this inhibition could contribute to the accumulation of neutrophils at sites of immune complex deposition in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Injection of heat-killed Escherichia coli into rats {{results in}} massive loss of IgM + ve, IgD - ve B {{cells from the}} {{marginal}} zones of their spleen within 4 hr. This is matched by a concomitant increase of cells with this phenotype in the splenic follicles. The marginal zone remains depleted and the follicles distended for about 16 hr, but the histological picture returns to normal within 24 hr. Surface marker analysis of blood and spleen B lymphocyte populations {{throughout the course of}} the migration suggest that there is intrasplenic migration of IgM + ve cells from marginal zone to follicles rather than via the circulation. Factors inhibiting localization of immune complex on follicular dendritic cells were assessed for their influence on marginal-zone B cell migration. Immune complex, injected 5 hr post-endotoxin administration localized poorly on follicular dendritic cells. While C 3 depletion, by cobra venom, has no effect on marginal-zone B cell migration induced by endotoxin, it completely inhibits transport of heat-aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> to follicular dendritic cells...|$|E
40|$|Antibody activity, {{especially}} that {{involved in the}} reaction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), of five commercially available <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> preparations (standard, pepsin-treated, plasmin-treated, polyethylene glycol-fractionated and S-sulfonated gammaglobulin) was measured. All these gammaglobulin preparations had high titers of hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody against measles virus. In ADCC reaction, the pepsin-treated gammaglobulin preparation showed no antibody activity. The standard gammaglobulin preparation showed weak activity only when highly diluted. The remaining three preparations showed high activity. Though the S-sulfonated gammaglobulin preparation showed no activity in ADCC reaction, it showed high activity after reconversion by means of oxidation and reduction in vitro. The plasmin-treated gammaglobulin preparation showed greater activity than the polyethylene glycol-fractionated preparation of the optimal concentration. In ADCC tests using the plasmin-treated gammaglobulin preparation, K cell activity was strongly inhibited by Hg (thimerosal), while, in those using the standard gammaglobulin preparation, the activity was hardly influenced by Hg, suggesting that the low ADCC activity of the standard gammaglobulin preparation of high concentrations {{was due to the}} inhibitory effect of aggregated immunoglobulin G molecules. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fluid free {{tetanus toxoid}} (FTT) alone or FTT {{complexed}} in vitro at equivalence (EQ) or in antibody excess (ABEX) with anti-toxin {{contained in a}} <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> preparation (HGG), or HGG alone, were injected into the hind leg footpads of mice. Anti-toxin titres of mouse serum were measured and compared with proliferative reactions in popliteal lymph nodes, based on combined 3 H-thymidine autoradiography and planimetry, {{as a function of}} time. FTT in complex with HGG in ABEX failed to elicit a measurable anti-toxin response but caused, of all the materials tested, the most marked numerical increase of germinal centres. This finding is in accord with results of earlier studies indicating that the same heterologous antigen-antibody complexes at EQ or in ABEX can prime the animals, usually without eliciting antibody production detectable by serum titration. The model system used in the present experiments is thus well suited for a separation of the two principal arms of the dichotomous humoral immune response, i. e. by inducing germinal centre and B cell memory development but not specific antibody formation...|$|E
40|$|Chrysotile {{asbestos}} fibres induce a rapid generation of reactive oxygen metabolites by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) in vitro. This effect was markedly {{enhanced by the}} presence of 10 - 200 micrograms/ml of <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin,</b> purified polyclonal IgG, and monoclonal IgG and IgA myeloma proteins. Purified monoclonal IgD, IgM, kappa light chain proteins, and secretory IgA inhibited this chrysotile-induced response. No enhancing effect of IgG was observed when quartz dust or opsonized zymosan were used as stimulators of PMNL metabolism. The enhancing effect of IgG was shown to depend on opsonization of the asbestos fibre. We suggest that the IgG and IgA potentiating effect on the asbestos fibre-induced production of tissue-damaging reactive oxygen metabolites by inflammatory cells is dependent on a particle-specific binding of immunoglobulin to the fibre surface, with subsequent Fc receptor-mediated effects on cells. Such an interaction between certain immunoglobulins and asbestos may explain a number of in vivo phenomena in which immunological responses (hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating immune complexes, etc.) have been shown to relate to the progression of pulmonary asbestosis. The differences between various immunoglobulin classes and monoclonal immunoglobulins could represent an individual inflammation-modulating mechanism in the development of acute or chronic pulmonary asbestosis...|$|E
40|$|The patient, a 54 -year-old housewife, {{was well}} {{until the age}} of 40 years when she {{developed}} repeated infections. During the next 10 years recurrent attacks of diarrhoea also appeared and were associated with weight loss, increased skin pigmentation, and later the occurrence of arthralgia and polyserositis. She was found to have deficiencies of IgG and IgA. A malabsorption syndrome was established and shown to be due to Whipple's disease by jejunal biopsy. She also had hypocalcaemia and osteomalacia. Weekly injections of <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> had no effect on either the diarrhoea or the arthralgia, although the severity of respiratory infections was reduced. Intramuscular injections of vitamin D failed to restore the serum calcium to normal. Continuous oral tetracycline was followed by marked symptomatic improvement, disappearance of the diarrhoea and some weight gain. Steatorrhoea however persisted and the jejunal histology showed only slight improvement. The serum calcium returned to normal possibly as a result of correction of a magnesium deficiency. The relevance of the hypogammaglobulinaemia to the Whipple's disease is discussed, and a search of the literature shows six other cases where both disorders were associated...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that tolerance to thymus-dependent antigens affects both T and B cells. It {{has been shown}} that thymocytes as well as T cells in the spleen become tolerant to, e. g., <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HGG) ~ in less than 1 day (1). Also, splenic B cells were rapidly tolerized to HGG, the time period being less than I day (1) or varying from 2 to 4 days (2). Thus, {{there appears to be no}} major differences between splenic T and B cells with regard to tolerance induction, but there is a pronounced difference with regard to the kinetics of the spontaneous loss of tolerance, which occurs in less than 60 days in B cells, but requires more than 100 days in T cells (2). It {{has been shown that}} the polyclonal B-cell activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can interfere with induction of tolerance (3) and is able to change an otherwise tolerogenic stimulus into an immunogenic one (4 - 6). LPS also has the ability to make haptens immunogenic (7). These effects of LPS do not appear to require participation ofT cells and are likely to represent a direct effect of LPS on B cells (2, 5). Polyclonal B-cell activators (PBA) are ligands which directly activate B cells int...|$|E
40|$|Two {{sisters and}} a brother from one family are {{described}} whose sera were deficient in haemolytic complement function. This defect was restored by addition of purified C 1 q. In their sera, C 1 q like material was found, whereas C 1 r and C 1 s were normal or increased in concentration, as were the other complement components tested. All three had suffered from glomerulonephritis during childhood. A renal biopsy in the brother recently disclosed a membranous glomerulopathy stage 1; otherwise, he is apparently healthy. In both sisters, a systemic lupus erythematosus like disease became manifest {{at the age of}} 20 and 23, respectively, resulting in the death of one of them. In the serum of these three family members, the C 1 q like material was antigenically deficient compared with normal C 1 q and had, on sucrose gradient analysis, a molecular weight of approximately 65, 000 daltons. It did not bind to C 1 r and C 1 s. Binding of the dysfunctional C 1 q to aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> could be demonstrated. On double immunodiffusion analysis, the abnormal C 1 q was identical with reduced and alkylated C 1 q. The possible structure of the abnormal C 1 q molecule is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Fc receptors, but not C 3 receptors, on human and bovine spermatozoa was shown by sperm-induced rosette formation of antibody-treated ox erythrocytes and by immunofluorescence of aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (AHG) treated spermatozoa. Human and bovine spermatozoa bound AHG {{as well as}} circulating immune complexes (CIC) from human sera; monomeric IgG bound to these cells to a much lesser extent. Binding of AHG to the sperm surface also occurred when the AHG was suspended in either buffer or in serum that had been heated at 56 degrees C for 30 min. A bovine spermatozoa radioimmunoassay {{for the detection of}} immune complexes in human sera was developed and was shown to be comparable to the Raji cell radioimmunoassay (r = 0. 81, P < 0. 01) in the quantitation of soluble immune complexes from a variety of human sera. An enzyme-linked immunoassay was then developed, using bovine spermatozoa fixed to wells of microtitre plates, to simplify the immune complex detection assay. The technique provides an analysis that is rapid, does not require radioactive chemicals, expensive equipment, or cultured cells and yields values for immune complex determination both comparable and complementary to the Raji cell radioimmunoassay (r = 0. 70, P < 0. 01). The sperm assays detected soluble immune complexes in sera of vasectomized males, cancer patients and patients with autoimmune or dermatological diseases...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of serum anti-DNA {{antibody}} in systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) by an antiidiotypic antibody was evaluated. Various sera from SLE patients in active and inactive states of their disease, as well as sera from normal individuals, were first completely depleted of anti-DNA and of DNA by affinity chromatography. The suppressive capacity of equimolar concentrations of the various depleted sera (blocking sera) on target lupus sera were determined. The target sera were from lupus patients with known DNA-binding capacity. Blocking sera from inactive SLE suppressed the binding of autologous anti-DNA antibody to [3 H]DNA (n = 19,P 0. 5), whereas those from normal donors who had contact with lupus patients or sera did suppress the binding (n = 5,P < 0. 02). The anti-anti-DNA antibody suppressive activity in the inactive lupus serum was shown to be localized within the F(abâ€²) 2 portion of immunoglobulin (Ig) G {{and could not be}} removed upon adsorption by normal <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin.</b> Furthermore, immune complexes could be detected by a Clq binding assay when the inactive lupus blocking sera were incubated with the anti-DNA antibody containing target sera.

40|$|An immune {{adherence}} receptor {{exists on}} the surface of primate erythrocytes, and has been characterized as a receptor for the activated third component of complement (C 3 b). We have applied human red blood cells (RBCs, blood group O) to a sensitive determination of complement-fixing, soluble immune complexes in serum. The method involved the binding of immune complexes with RBCs in the presence of complement and the detection of cell-bound IgG molecules by radiolabelled anti-human IgG antibodies. Since the binding of RBCs with monomeric IgG was minimal, cell-bound IgG molecules were taken as representing immune complexes. When aggregated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (AHG) was used as a model of immune complexes, as little as 5 Î¼g dissolved in 1 ml of normal human serum were detected. The binding of RBCs with AHG was inhibited in EDTA solution where the classical complement pathway could not be activated. The RBC radioimmune assay was successfully applied to the determination of soluble immune complexes in pathological serum samples obtained from the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and those with fulminant Type B hepatitis. False-positive results by autoantibodies against RBCs could be excluded by performing a Coombs test and by comparing the binding in the presence of complement with that in EDTA solution. The ubiquitous availability of RBCs coupled with a high sensitivity would allow the RBC radioimmune assay {{to be added to the}} battery of previous methods to determine immune complexes in the serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of paired sera and synovial fluids from 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced a rapid chemiluminescent response when incubated with human neutrophils. Synovial fluid gave considerably higher responses than the paired serum specimen. In contrast {{little or no}} response was found with paired sera and joint fluid taken from patients with gout, psoriasis, and osteoarthritis and with sera from healthy donors. A similar chemiluminescent response was observed when neutrophils were preincubated with large aggregates of heated <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HAGG), which were used {{as a model of}} immune complexes. Smaller nonreactive aggregates of gammaglobulin became reactive after preincubation with a purified monoclonal rheumatoid factor (mRF) which had a high avidity for aggregated IgG. The addition of this monoclonal rheumatoid factor also caused enhancement of chemiluminescence by rheumatoid sera. Further evidence suggesting that the active material found in these rheumatoid specimens contained complexed immunoglobulin was obtained by indirect immunofluorescence. Neutrophils developed intracellular immunoglobulin inclusions after preincubation in reactive rheumatoid sera but not with nonreactive or normal sera. However, activation of neutrophil chemiluminescence by rheumatoid specimens did not correlate significantly with levels of rheumatoid factor or immune complexes suggesting that the activating complexes were of a particular type. In conclusion we have shown the direct activation of neutrophil chemiluminescence by rheumatoid sera synovial fluid and suggest that the activation is caused by large IgG-containing immune complexes. It is possible that this activation may have important implications in the immunopathogenesis of the rheumatoid inflammatory process...|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune male, but not female, BXSB/MpJ mice {{resist the}} {{induction}} of tolerance to <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HGG). To better define the cellular {{basis for this}} abnormality, we have compared in vitro the functional activity of antigen-presenting cells between tolerant-resistant male and susceptible female mice, and evaluated in vivo the immunological status of HGG-specific T helper cells in male BXSB mice after the treatment with monomeric deaggregated HGG (DHGG). Our results indicated {{that there were no}} significant differences in the ability of male and female antigen-presenting cells to present HGG to either male or female HGG-specific immune T blasts. Further, thymic cells from DHGG-treated male BXSB mice failed to support anti-HGG antibody responses when adoptively transferred with non-treated bone marrow cells, and that draining lymph node cells from male as well as female BXSB mice treated with DHGG prior to the challenge of immunogenic aggregated HGG (AHGG) were unable to exhibit the proliferation upon in vitro restimulation with AHGG. This indicates that HGG-specific T helper cells were indeed tolerized in tolerant-resistant male BXSB mice by the treatment with DHGG. In contrast, when the tolerance induction was inhibited by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, HGG-specific T helper cells from such mice exhibited a marked proliferation upon in vitro restimulation with AHGG. These results suggest that the cellular defect in the abnormal resistance to tolerance induction to HGG in male BXSB mice resides neither in the antigen-presenting cells nor in the HGG-specific T helper cells, and that the mechanism responsible for this abnormality in male BXSB mice is basically different from that involved when tolerance is overcome by lipopolysaccharide...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} the level of anti-DNA antibody can be modulated in humans with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). DNA fragments of different sizes, i. e., oligonucleotide (N 20 - 30) or oligonucleotide (N 10 - 100), were covalently linked either to <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> (HGG) and used as tolerogens or to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as immunogens. Experiments were done to determine whether such tolerogens specifically diminish antibodies to denatured DNA, native DNA, or both. PBL were obtained from 87 patients with SLE, 55 of whom spontaneously produced anti-DNA antibodies in vitro. Furthermore, of these 55 test subjects 23 made anti-DNA antibodies in response to antigen challenge in vitro. Exposure of PBL to tolerogenic oligonucleotide-HGG reduced spontaneous antibody formation in 34 of the 55 patients' PBL and abrogated the in vitro-induced response in all instances. The suppression was tolerogen specific. In some SLE patients lymphoid cells were suppressed by both (N 10 - 100) -HGG and (N 20 - 30) -HGG, while in others lymphoid cells were suppressed by only one. Longitudinal studies of spontaneous antibody production showed that the same tolerogens consistently reduced anti-DNA antibody formation in lymphoid cells of 12 patients on several occasions over a 2 -yr interval, but in 8 others the results were either variable or inconsistent. In contrast, tolerogens consistently abrogated the antigen-induced response in all 23 patients' PBL. These results obtained in humans in vitro suggest that the principle of carrier-determined tolerance could be applied as a specific therapy for SLE in vivo...|$|E

Intravenous administration of heterologous anti-rat thymocyte serum (ATS), which reacts with a Thy- 1 -like antigen present on rat glomerular mesangial cells, caused lytic (1 hr to 2 days), hypercellular (4 to 14 days), and sclerotic (2 to 3 months) mesangial lesions in Lewis rats. The normal control of 48. 6 Â± 7. 9 (mean Â± SD) glomerular nuclei on histologic section decreased significantly (P 0. 05) to 49. 4 Â± 8. 9 at one month and 50. 6 Â± 9. 0 at three months. By electron microscopy, glomerular damage in the lytic stage was restricted to mesangial cells and was manifested as hydropic degeneration or lysis. Rabbit IgG and rat C 3 {{were found in the}} mesangium one hour after injection; they decreased at two days and were negligible at four days. By paired label isotope study, 11. 6 Âµg of antibody bound per 7. 6 Ã— 104 glomeruli at one hour was needed to induce mesangial cell degeneration. No or only minimal changes in proteinuria and in serum creatinine were observed with the dosage used in this rat strain.

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to transfer components of the human immune system into mice. In particular, the adoptive transfer of human Iymphoid cells or tissues into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID mice) has demonstrated the general applicability of such an approach. SCID mice have an autosomal recessive defect that impairs the rearrangement of antigen receptor genes in Iymphoid progenitors. Lack of an effective immune response, coupled with the intact hematopoietic microenvironment, allows the SCID mice to be reconstituted with human cells. Intraperitoneal transfer of human peripheral blood Iymphocytes was utilized to reconstitute the animals. Homing of human cells into mouse tissues and the synthesis of human immunoglobulins in chimenc SCID mice were analyzed. The effect of pretreatment regimens such as total body irradiation as well as the inf 1 uence of the source of cells on human immunoglobulin synthesis were investigated. Studies were performed to characterize animals repopulated with cells from individuals with primary immunoglobulin deficiencies and autoimmunity. The effect of gammaglobulin treatment on autoantibody production was investigated in SCID mice engrafted with cells from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Human antimitochondrial antibodies could be detected in reconstituted animals. Treatment with <b>human</b> <b>gammaglobulin</b> resulted in a rapid decrease of autoantibodies in the circulation. SCID mice engrafted with Iymphocytes from donors seropositive for Epstein-Barr virus frequently develop Iymphoproliferative disease of human origin. The antitumor effect of various treatment modalities such as antiviral or gammaglobulin treatments was studied in the chimeric SCID mice. A preventive effect of gammaglobulin treatment on tumor formation was found which was shown to be due to the presence of antibodies directed to Epstein-Barr virus-related antigens in the gammaglobulin preparations. The last study was aimed at developing a mouse model of suicide gene therapy for human plasma cell tumors. SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with human myeloma cell lines transduced with a herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene and subsequently treated with ganciclovir.
