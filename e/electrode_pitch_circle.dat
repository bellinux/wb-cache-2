50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear, around the other, called the sun gear. The planet and sun gears mesh so that their <b>pitch</b> <b>circles</b> roll without slip. A point on the <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.|$|R

40|$|A {{standard}} 37 -element {{fuel bundle}} (37 S fuel bundle) {{has been used}} in commercial CANDU reactors for over 40 years as a reference fuel bundle. Most CHF of a 37 S fuel bundle have occurred at the elements arranged in the inner <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> for high flows and at the elements arranged in the outer <b>pitch</b> <b>circle</b> for low flows. It should be noted that a 37 S fuel bundle has a relatively small flow area and high flow resistance at the peripheral subchannels of its center element compared to the other subchannels. The configuration of a fuel bundle is one of the important factors affecting the local CHF occurrence. Considering the CHF characteristics of a 37 S fuel bundle in terms of CHF enhancement, there can be two approaches to enlarge the flow areas of the peripheral subchannels of a center element in order to enhance CHF of a 37 S fuel bundle. To increase the center subchannel areas, one approach is the reduction of the diameter of a center element, and the other is an increase of the inner <b>pitch</b> <b>circle.</b> The former can increase the total flow area of a fuel bundle and redistributes the power density of all fuel elements as well as the CHF. On the other hand, the latter can reduce the gap between the elements located in the middle and inner <b>pitch</b> <b>circles</b> owing to the increasing inner <b>pitch</b> <b>circle.</b> This can also affect the enthalpy redistribution of the fuel bundle and finally enhance CHF or dry-out power. In this study, the above two approaches, which are proposed to enlarge the flow areas of the center subchannels, were considered to investigate the impact of the flow area changes of the center subchannels on the CHF enhancement as well as the thermal characteristics by applying a subchannel analysis method...|$|R
