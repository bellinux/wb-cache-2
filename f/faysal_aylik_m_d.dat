40|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (<b>m</b> <b>d</b> d) is {{the disorder}} {{with the most}} important global burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years. Objetive: to determine the current prevalence of <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d {{in the general population}} in Bucaramanga, Colombia, and to explore the risk factors associated with them. Methodology: this is a cross-sectional survey with a population random sampling that involved 18 - 65 year-old people living in Bucaramanga. A psychiatric diagnosis of a <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d during last month was accomplished using Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I diagnoses (s c i d-i) according to the d s m-i v-t r criteria issued by the American Psychiatric Association. Results: a total amount of 266 people were selected (57, 1 % women). Their mean age were 37, 4 years and the formal education years were 9, 8. A total of 12, 0 % was unemployed, 56, 1 % had a stable couple, and 51, 2 % lived in medium socioeconomic strata. The prevalence of <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d was 16, 5 % (95 % c i 12, 3 - 21, 6). A significant association was identified between the fact of not having a stable couple (p r = 2, 11) and the and level of education (p r = 0, 41, for 6 - 11 cursed years, and p r = 0, 28, for 12 or more cursed years, compared to five or lesser years of schooling) and the <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d. Discussion: the current prevalence of <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d is high among adult general population from Bucaramanga. This implies the necessity to develop better strategies for an early detection and an integral treatment of <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d cases in order to decrease social and economical costs of <b>m</b> <b>d</b> d...|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the phase {{convention}} of the CKM matrix V affects texture analysis of the quark mass matrices (<b>M</b> u; <b>M</b> <b>d)</b> when we try to describe (<b>M</b> u; <b>M</b> <b>d)</b> by the observable quantities (quark masses and CKM matrix parameters) only. This is demonstrated for a case of the non-Hermitian Fritzsch-type mass matrix (f M u; f <b>M</b> <b>d),</b> which is a general expression of quark mass matrix (<b>M</b> u; <b>M</b> <b>d)</b> and is described by twelve parameters.

40|$|Let L ≥ 1, ɛ> 0 be real numbers, (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> be {{a finite}} metric space and (N, ρ) be a metric space (Rudin 1976). The metric space (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> {{is said to}} be L-bilipschitz {{embeddable}} into (N, ρ) if there is an injective function f: M → N with 1 /L · d(x, y) ≤ ρ(f(x), f(y)) ≤ L · d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ N (Farb & Mosher 1999, David & Semmes 2000, Croom 2002). In this paper, we also say that (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> is ɛ-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, ρ) if the above inequality fails on at least an ɛ fraction of pairs (x, y) ∈ M × M for every injective function f: M → N. Below, a query to a metric space consists of asking for the distance between a pair of points chosen for that query. We study the number of queries to metric spaces (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> and (N, ρ) needed to answer whether (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> is L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, ρ) or ɛ-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, ρ). When (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> is ɛ-far from being L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, ρ), we allow an o(1) probability of error (i. e., returning the wrong answer “L-bilipschitz embeddable”). However, we allow no error when (<b>M,</b> <b>d)</b> is L-bilipschitz embeddable into (N, ρ). That is, algorithms with only one-sided errors are considered in this paper.
