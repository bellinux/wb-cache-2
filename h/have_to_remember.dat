25|$|A {{reasonable}} compromise {{for using}} {{large numbers of}} passwords is to record them in a password manager program, which include stand-alone applications, web browser extensions, or a manager built into the operating system. A password manager allows the user to use hundreds of different passwords, and only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a single password, the one which opens the encrypted password database. Needless to say, this single password should be strong and well-protected (not recorded anywhere). Most password managers can automatically create strong passwords using a cryptographically secure random password generator, as well as calculating the entropy of the generated password. A good password manager will provide resistance against attacks such as key logging, clipboard logging and various other memory spying techniques.|$|E

The film, which Wisdom later announced (reported BBC/ITV News) was to be officially his last film role, is set during one day {{in a coffee shop}} and was funded by the UK Film Council and ScreenWM. Shot in January, it premièred at the Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity Macmillan and released on DVD in aid of the charity. In the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.|$|E

In U.S. News and World Report, he {{explained}} why he decided against forming an exploratory committee {{like many of his}} Democratic rivals, on the principle that he had [...] "to get to work." [...] He linked the issue of energy security to global warming and national security. He advocated moving American troops from southern and central Iraq to the north, and further commented that political reconciliation must be refocused on [...] "building local governance" [...] rather than spending [...] "all the time on the national government." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, he made a distinction between [...] "experience and judgment" [...] and emphasized the importance of the latter. Vilsack attacked Republican candidate John McCain's planned Iraq troop surge as [...] "making a big mistake bigger", and denied that the military had the resources to execute it. In discounting the importance of name recognition, he said [...] "people don’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> my name, they only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the first letter which is V.

It was written by Berman and Braga, who responded to negative criticism of the episode by saying [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that under normal circumstances most people probably would have thought this was a very cool episode because it has a great concept driving it".

He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{video to}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the video for [...] "Tim McGraw". Swift decided to film the video with Fanjoy {{as a result of}} how positive the experience was when filming [...] "Tim McGraw". She appreciated all the preparation techniques that she taught her and stated, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the people who were good to you in the beginning". Swift said the video centered around unrequited love. Some of Swift's associates first believed the video should have been set in a prior era. They then thought about filming the video at a large city. However, Swift {{wanted to go back to}} basics and keep the song's integrity by filming the video in Nashville, Tennessee. American singer and actor Tyler Hilton portrayed Drew. He was cast because of prior interactions with Swift. They had a mutual fondness for each other's music. Taking into account his acting on the television series One Tree Hill and the film Walk the Line (2005), Swift asked him to participate in the video after he attended and performed at one of her concerts. Swift chose Hilton primarily because he accurately presented Drew Hardwick, the fun, funny, fun-loving, blue-eyed boy whom she was friends with and had a huge crush on during high school. The video was filmed in one day in March 2007 at Hume-Fogg High School; the drama room was transformed to simulate a bedroom for the performance scenes.|$|E

Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... you always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way.

2500|$|Trouble {{was formed}} in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist Bruce Franklin, vocalist Eric Wagner, bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be {{confused}} with lead singer of English band The Stone Roses), and drummer Jeff Olson. Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983. Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics, which led Metal Blade to market the band as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. [...] "I was brought up Catholic", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue (2006), [...] "but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not get into that vibe."
