40|$|The {{detection}} {{and location of}} hydrogen induced cracks In steel pipes is unreliable and time consuming because of the unpredictable nature of the defect {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of conventional non destructive testing techniques. Determination of the susceptibility of steels to the formation of hydrogen induced cracking by attack from a sour gas environment has always been based on laboratory testing of small samples where the samples are subjected to attack from all sides. This is unrealistic compared to the in-service situation and a single sided exposure test is more realistic. In this thesis the subject literature is reviewed. Experiments on small samples show that seamless steel is the least susceptible to hydrogen induced cracking, whereas <b>electric</b> <b>welded</b> un directionally formed pipe is the most susceptible. The susceptibility of submerged arc welded pipe depends on the metallurgical form of the pipe but is always less susceptible than the <b>electric</b> <b>welded</b> pipe. Ultrasonic techniques have been used to detect the location of hydrogen induced cracks but manual techniques are labour intensive and unreliable. Four complete pipes were subjected to a sour gas environment from one side, one of which was seamless and one <b>electric</b> <b>welded.</b> These pipes were monitored using a passive non destructive testing technique, acoustic emission. A mechanised ultrasonic scanner was used to examine the last two pipes found to be susceptible to cracking using a specially selected ultrasonic transducer. The acoustic emission data collected was used to detect and locate areas of high acoustic activity produced by the formation of hydrogen Induced cracking. These areas were examined metallographically and shown to include several forms of hydrogen induced cracking. The mechanised ultrasonic technique failed to detect near surface (< 1 mm) cracks, but was able to resolve mid wall affected areas. The seamless steel pipe was unaffected, whereas the <b>electric</b> <b>welded</b> pipe was severely affected by the sour gas environment. The automatic welded pipes suffered varying degrees of attack. This supports laboratory based experiments on small samples reported previously by other workers...|$|R

She {{represented}} a transition in steel shipbuilding, as the decks and butts of her topside plating were assembled by <b>electric</b> <b>welding</b> (then relatively new in British shipyards) {{but the rest of}} her hull were assembled by the more traditional method of rivetting.

25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some pipe {{connections}} and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, <b>electric</b> <b>welding</b> became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the hull could {{generally}} be reduced by using higher grades of steel that were lighter and thinner for the same strength, reducing dimensions, particularly length, or using advanced construction techniques like welding that saved weight over the conventional riveting. The Japanese used the same high tensile steel for the Hatsuharu class as they did for the older destroyers and chose not to increase {{the power of the}} turbines and boilers to achieve the desired high speed, but lengthened the hull to offset the reduced power of the light-weight machinery. The beam was increased to counter some of the extra top-weight, but the draft was reduced to reduce hull resistance, which also reduced stability by lessening the area of the hull beneath the waterline in comparison to the area above it, which was subject to pressure from the wind. <b>Electric</b> <b>welding</b> was extensively used to reduce weight although it was at an early stage of development in Japan and was still problematic.|$|E

The Factory No. 174 developed {{the design of}} 30–40mm appliqué armour {{for all types of}} single-turreted T-26s during the Winter War. On 30 December 1939, factory tests proved that the T-26 with appliqué armour successfully resisted fire from a 45mm anti-tank gun at a range from 400–500 m. Side and front armoured plates were mounted with the use of blunt bolts and <b>electric</b> <b>welding.</b> Toward the middle of February 1940, the RKKA received 27 screened T-26 mod. 1939 tanks and 27 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks; an additional 15 T-26 mod. 1939 tanks were armoured by workshops of the 8th Army in Suoyarvi in the beginning of March 1940. All in all, 69 T-26s with appliqué armour were used during the Winter War and 20 more were delivered to tank units {{after the end of the}} war. Combat use proved that Finnish light anti-tank guns could not penetrate the armour of these tanks.|$|E

50|$|Low-frequency <b>electric</b> {{resistance}} <b>weld,</b> LF-ERW is <b>Electric</b> resistance <b>welded</b> (ERW) pipe {{manufactured by}} cold-forming {{a sheet of}} steel into a cylindrical shape.

Initially this manufacturing process used low frequency A.C. current to heat the edges. This low frequency process was used from the 1920s until 1970.
