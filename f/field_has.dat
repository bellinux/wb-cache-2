40|$|In {{this article}} we extend the Bloch-Wigner exact {{sequence}} over local rings, where their residue <b>fields</b> <b>have</b> more than nine elements. Moreover, we prove Van der Kallen's theorem on {{the presentation of the}} second $K$-group of local rings such that their residue <b>fields</b> <b>have</b> more than four elements. Note that Van der Kallen proved this result when the residue <b>fields</b> <b>have</b> more than five elements. Although we prove our results over local rings, all our proofs also work over semilocal rings where all their residue <b>fields</b> <b>have</b> similar properties as the residue field of local rings.

This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may only use flashlights with red filters, and may only point them at the ground.

5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary <b>field</b> <b>has</b> {{come to be known as}} science and technology studies.|$|E
5|$|About 70% {{of schools}} teach {{music at the}} lower {{secondary}} level. Many of the schools that do not normally instruct in music may offer volunteer clubs or other more informal opportunities for musical enrichment. Many Lucian schools have formed ensembles, most commonly a wind ensemble (30% of schools), or a steelpan band (20%) or combo group (20%). The public education <b>field</b> <b>has</b> also collaborated with the Saint Lucia School of Music to form the National Youth Choir, String Orchestra and Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble. The governmental Ministry of Education also sponsors a number of festivals and musical special events, both {{for the benefit of}} all students and the enrichment of the musically-gifted among them.|$|E

5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep <b>Field</b> <b>has</b> since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where the rest of the <b>field</b> <b>has</b> a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, {{it must be noted that}} this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E
5|$|As the National Soccer Stadium, {{it served}} as a major venue for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, {{including}} hosting the opening and final matches. In 2008, it played host to the 2008 MLS All-Star Game. BMO <b>Field</b> <b>has</b> also hosted various high-profile teams in international friendlies such as Real Madrid in 2009. It was chosen as a neutral venue to host the 2010 MLS Cup in November 2010. It also holds other sports, such as Rugby Sevens during the 2015 Pan American Games and beginning in 2016, the Toronto Argonauts Canadian Football League (CFL) team. It hosted a Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League game on January 1, 2017, as the NHL Centennial Classic.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{vegetation and}} invertebrate characteristics, including insect biomass, insect-prey, six Families and seven Orders in four varieties of Conservation Reserve Program (CP 10, improved CP 10, CP 2 and CP 25) and wheat fields in western Kansas during Jun. and Jul., 2004 and 2005 relative to gamebird chick ecology. CP 10 <b>fields</b> <b>had</b> less bare ground and forbs {{compared to the}} other Conservation Practices and CP 25 <b>fields</b> <b>had</b> lost much of their original forb component {{by the end of the}} study. Although there was little forb component, CP 10 <b>fields</b> <b>had</b> high invertebrate biomass. However, CP 10 fields demonstrated sizeable declines in the estimated effect size of examined invertebrate characteristics between sampling periods unlike the other mixes. Unharvested wheat (Triticum aestivum), CP 10 and improved CP 10 <b>fields</b> <b>had</b> the greatest number of insect-prey. Overall, most <b>fields</b> <b>had</b> adequate insect-prey availability suggesting that in terms of insect availability for gamebird chicks, these fields provide excellent brood feeding opportunities, therefore accessibility and other issues might be more important in determining habitat ‘‘quality’’ for gamebird chicks...|$|R

In 2011, the University of Washington began a $250 million renovation to Husky Stadium, so the Huskies and the Washington State Cougars played the 2011 Apple Cup at CenturyLink Field. The Huskies also played their entire 2012 home football schedule at CenturyLink Field.|$|E
5|$|Currently the Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcanic field's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is {{too far away to}} provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the volcanic field. It may sense an increase in activity if the volcanic field becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption.

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth <b>Field</b> <b>has</b> any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
