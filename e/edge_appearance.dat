40|$|Nonparametric belief {{propagation}} (NBP) is {{a well-known}} particle-based method for distributed inference in wireless networks. NBP has {{a large number of}} applications, including cooperative localization. However, in loopy networks NBP suffers from similar problems as standard BP, such as over-confident beliefs and possible nonconvergence. Tree-reweighted NBP (TRW-NBP) can mitigate these problems, but does not easily lead to a distributed implementation due to the non-local nature of the required so-called <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> probabilities. In this paper, we propose a variation of TRWNBP, suitable for cooperative localization in wireless networks. Our algorithm uses a fixed <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> probability for every edge, and can outperform standard NBP in dense wireless networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For every {{segmentation}} task, {{prior knowledge}} about the ob-ject that shall be segmented has to be incorporated. This is typically performed either automatically by using labeled data to train the used algorithm, or by manual adaptation of the algorithm to the specific ap-plication. For the segmentation of 3 D data, the generation of training sets is very tedious and time consuming, since in most cases, an expert has to mark the object boundaries in all slices of the 3 D volume. To avoid this, we developed a new framework that combines unsupervised and su-pervised learning. First, the possible <b>edge</b> <b>appearances</b> are grouped, such that, in the second step, the expert only has to choose between relevant and non-relevant clusters. This way, even objects with very different <b>edge</b> <b>appearances</b> in {{different regions of the}} boundary can be segmented, while the user interaction is limited to a very simple operation. In the presented work, the chosen edge clusters are used to generate a filter for all rele-vant edges. The filter response is used to generate an edge map based on which an active surface segmentation is performed. The evaluation on the segmentation of plant cells recorded with 3 D confocal microscopy yields convincing results. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{inference}} algorithm, suitable for distributed processing over wireless networks. The algorithm, called uniformly reweighted belief propagation (URW-BP), combines the local nature of belief propagation with the improved performance of tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW-BP) in graphs with cycles. It reduces the {{degrees of freedom}} in the latter algorithm to a single scalar variable, the uniform <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> probability rho. We provide a variational interpretation of URW-BP, give insights into good choices of rho, develop an extension to higher-order potentials, and complement our work with numerical performance results on three inference problems in wireless communication systems: spectrum sensing in cognitive radio, cooperative positioning, and decoding of a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code...|$|E
40|$|Belief {{propagation}} (BP) is {{a technique}} for distributed inference in wireless networks and is often used even when the underlying graphical model contains cycles. In this paper, we propose a uniformly reweighted BP scheme that reduces the impact of cycles by weighting messages by a constant ?<b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> probability? rho ? 1. We apply this algorithm to distributed binary hypothesis testing problems (e. g., distributed detection) in wireless networks with Markov random field models. We demonstrate that in the considered setting the proposed method outperforms standard BP, while maintaining similar complexity. We then show that the optimal ? can be approximated as a simple function of the average node degree, and can hence be computed in a distributed fashion through a consensus algorithm...|$|E

It is found that a good channel top <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> and bottom surface quality without wavy patterns {{can be achieved by}} employing relatively small particles at shallow jet impact angles. The major channel performance measures, i. e. material removal rate (MRR) and channel depth, are then discussed with respect to the process parameters.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} study we found that blurred edges presented in peripheral vision look sharper than when they are looked at directly, a phenomenon we have called peripheral sharpness overconstancy (Galvin et al. (1997). Vision Research, 37, 2035 – 2039). In the current study we show that when visibility of the stimulus edges is compromised by very brief presentations, we can demonstrate sharpness overconstancy for static, foveal viewing. We also test whether the degree of sharpening {{is a function of}} the current visual context, but find no difference between the peripheral sharpness overconstancy (at 24 ° eccentricity) of edges measured in a blurred context and that measured in a sharp context. We conclude that if the visual system does carry a template for sharp edges which contributes to <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> when visibility is poor, then that template is resistant to changes in context...|$|E
40|$|We propose generalizations of {{a number}} of {{standard}} network models, including the classic random graph, the configuration model, and the stochastic block model, to the case of time-varying networks. We assume that the presence and absence of edges are governed by continuous-time Markov processes with rate parameters that can depend on properties of the nodes. In addition to computing equilibrium properties of these models, we demonstrate their use in data analysis and statistical inference, giving efficient algorithms for fitting them to observed network data. This allows us, for instance, to estimate the time constants of network evolution or infer community structure from temporal network data using cues embedded both in the probabilities over time that node pairs are connected by edges and in the characteristic dynamics of <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> and disappearance. We illustrate our methods with a selection of applications, both to computer-generated test networks and real-world examples. Comment: 15 pages, four figure...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{semantic}} part segmentation for animals. This is more challenging than standard object detection, object segmentation and pose estimation tasks because semantic parts of animals often have similar appearance and highly varying shapes. To tackle these challenges, we build a mixture of compositional models to represent the object boundary and the boundaries of semantic parts. And we incorporate <b>edge,</b> <b>appearance,</b> and semantic part cues into the compositional model. Given part-level segmentation annotation, we develop a novel algorithm to learn a mixture of compositional models under various poses and viewpoints for certain animal classes. Furthermore, a linear complexity algorithm is offered for efficient inference of the compositional model using dynamic programming. We evaluate our method for horse and cow using a newly annotated dataset on Pascal VOC 2010 which has pixelwise part labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

40|$|Graphical network {{inference}} {{is used in}} many {{fields such}} as genomics or ecology to infer the conditional independence structure between variables, from measurements of gene expression or species abundances for instance. In many practical cases, {{it is likely that}} not all variables involved in the network have been actually observed. The observed samples are therefore drawn from a distribution where some unobserved variables have been marginalized out. In this context, the inference of underlying networks is compromised because marginalization in graphical models yields locally dense structures, which challenges the assumption that biological networks are sparse. In this article we present a procedure for inferring Gaussian graphical models in the presence of unobserved variables. We provide a model based on spanning trees and the EM algorithm which accounts both for the influence of unobserved variables and the low density of the network. We treat the graph structure and the unobserved nodes as latent variables and compute posterior probabilities of <b>edge</b> <b>appearance.</b> We also propose several model selection criteria to estimate the number of missing nodes, and compare our method to existing graph inference techniques on simulations and on a flow cytometry data illustration...|$|E

Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to analyse the spread of malware {{and the effect of}} patching specific nodes.

In this paper we first study how the blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is ineffective: {{this is due to the}} richness of alternative paths in these networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets.

A series of Ge 10 As 40 Te 50 -xSex(x= 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) chalcogenide glass samples were prepared by the traditional melt-quenching method. The internal microstructure, {{physical and chemical properties}} of the glass samples were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and thermal dilatometer instruments. Vis-NIR absorption spectra and infrared optical transmission spectra of these glasses were recorded with Spectrophotometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy instrument. Then, the Tauc equation was adopted to calculate the direct and indirect optical band gaps of the glass samples. The results show that with the increasing of the Se, the thermal stability can be effectively improved, the maximum Tg can reach up to 233 ℃. A obvious blue shift of short infrared absorption spectrum cut-off <b>edge</b> <b>appearance</b> is observed in these glasses, i. e. The optical band gap increases gradually, which shows a wider range of transmission and better transparency spectrum, the maximum transmission rate can reach up to 56 %. Infrared cut-off edge remains at 20 μm, while Se content is less than 2 mol, its thermal stability is improved obviously and the optical spectral changes little. At last, using metal Mg as an oxide redactor for the purification of these glasses, the results show that the transmission spectra is much smooth and without any obvious impurity absorption peaks after the appropriate purification process. © 2016, Science Press.

In the proposed approach, the graphic symbols are first segmented into high-level primitive like quadrilaterals.

Additional information like relative length of the quadrilaterals and their relative angles with neighbouring quadrilaterals are associated as attributes to the nodes and edges of the graph respectively. However, the observed graphs are subject to deformations due to noise and/or vectorial distortion (in case of hand-drawn images) hence differs somewhat from their ideal models by either missing or extra nodes and <b>edges</b> <b>appearance.</b> Therefore, we propose a method that computes a measure of similarity between two given graphs instead of looking for exact isomorphism.

40|$|Modeling {{object is}} one of the core {{problems}} in computer vision. A good object model can be applied to multiple visual recognition tasks. In this thesis, we use compositional relations to model the objects and parts for articulated objects, which is very challenging due to the large variability by subtypes, viewpoints and poses. Intuitively, objects are composed of parts, and each part is then composed of subparts. By recursively applying the compositional relations, we can obtain a hierarchical structure of the object, which is called compositional model. Compared to the popular black-box deep learning system, our model enjoys the advantages of explainability, and adaptivity to more complex scenarios. There are three challenges for the compositional model: 1) How to learn the parts and subparts, 2) How to learn the compositional structure between parts and subparts, 3) How to allow efficient learning and inference. In this thesis, we mainly focus on three relevant projects using the concept of compositions and parts. In the first project, we study the problem of semantic part segmentation for animals. Compositional model is used to represent boundaries of objects and parts. Given part-level boundary annotations, a mixture of models is learned to deal with various viewpoints and poses. We also incorporate <b>edge,</b> <b>appearance,</b> and semantic part cues into the compositional model. Besides, a linear complexity algorithm is developed for efficient inference. The evaluation using horse and cow images from PASCAL VOC demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In the second project, we provide a novel unsupervised method to learn object semantic parts from internal states of CNNs. Our hypothesis is that semantic parts are represented by populations of neurons rather than by single filters. We propose a simple clustering technique to extract part representations, which we call visual concepts. We qualitatively show that visual concepts are semantically coherent in that they represent most semantic parts of the object, and visually coherent in that their corresponding image patches appear very similar. Next, we treat the visual concepts as part detectors and quantitatively evaluate their performance for detecting semantic parts. The experiments on the PASCAL 3 D+ dataset and our newly annotated VehicleSemanticPart dataset support that CNNs have internal representations of object parts encoded by populations of neurons. In the third project, we use the visual concepts for detecting the semantic parts on partially occluded objects. We consider a scenario where the model is trained using non-occluded images but tested on occluded images. The motivation is that there are infinite number of occlusion patterns in real world, so the models should be inherently robust and adaptive to occlusions instead of learning the occlusion patterns in the training data. Our approach uses a simple voting scheme, based on log-likelihood ratio tests and spatial constraints, to combine the evidence of local cues, which are derived from visual concepts. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms several competitors in semantic part detection, especially in the presence of occlusions...|$|E

In our model, the ramp narrows an internal representation of the gradient profile, leading to a reduction in perceived blur. This in turn reduces perceived contrast because estimated blur plays a role in the model’s estimation of contrast. Interestingly, the model predicts that analogous effects should occur when the width of the window containing the edge is made narrower.
