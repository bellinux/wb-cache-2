2500|$|The {{theory of}} highly super-Eddington black hole accretion, M>>MEdd, was {{developed}} in the 1980s by Abramowicz, Jaroszynski, Paczy≈Ñski, Sikora and others in terms of [...] "Polish doughnuts" [...] (the name was coined by Rees). Polish doughnuts are low viscosity, optically thick, radiation pressure supported accretion disks cooled by advection. They are radiatively very inefficient. Polish doughnuts resemble in shape a <b>fat</b> <b>torus</b> (a doughnut) with two narrow funnels along the rotation axis. The funnels collimate the radiation into beams with highly super-Eddington luminosities.|$|E

It includes both <b>fat</b> tree and <b>torus</b> structure, and suitable to map tasks in a stream processing. For on-chip implementation, folding layout is also proposed. Evaluation results show that Fat H-Tree reduces the distance of H-Tree from 13 % to 55 %, and stretches the throughput almost three times. ...|$|R
40|$|The Network-on-Chip (NoC) {{concept has}} been {{identified}} as an attractive solution to the ever-increasing interconnect problem in complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable topology structure for NoC designs based on the web graph. This topology, named as Spidernet, is compared favourably to other five popular NoC topologies, including mesh, <b>torus,</b> <b>fat</b> tree, octagon, and spidergon in terms of node degree, network diameter, connection degree, average most short-circuit path, and average shortest wire length. We further propose a 2 D layout design for Spidernet, and experiment results have confirmed its superiority over layouts derived from the above five competing topologies...|$|R

SoCs have undergone rapid evolution and are still progressing at a swift pace. Due to explosive evolution of semiconductor industry, the devices are scaling down at a rapid rate and hence, the SoCs today have become communication-centric and shared bus system and crossbar system were fail to performed communication in side SoC. Interconnection networks offer an alternate solution to this communication paradigm and are becoming persistent in SoC. A NoC based interconnect network is a well-organized and efficiently use of limited communication channel while maintaining low packet latency, high saturation throughput, high communication bandwidth amongst different IPs core with a minimum area and low power-dissipation. In this thesis we present details performance analysis of four interconnect network mesh, <b>torus,</b> <b>fat</b> tree and butterfly in term of latency and throughput under uniform, tornado, neighbour, bit reversal and bit complement traffic using cycle accurate simulator. We also implement NoC interconnect networks on FPGA and see the effect of NoC parameters(FDW,FBD,VC) on FPGA, and validate their performance through FPGA synthesis. We found that the FDW and buffer depth have the great effect on FPGA resources, Virtual Channels (VCs) with all NoC parameter have considerably effect on buffer size and routing and logic requirements at NoC. We also analysis all interconnect networks in term of power and area at 65 nm technology by using synopsis tool. We found that butterfly interconnect network has highest power and Area efficient interconnect network but it will suffer heavily degradation on performance at high load so fat tree network is efficient network among all interconnect network...|$|R
