30|$|By definition, the {{syndrome}} called sepsis implies a systemic inflammation, which changes the blood content with activated immune cells, release of mediators and hormones and presence of pathogen-related molecule (PAMPs) or tissue damage molecule (DAMPs). These modifications differ along time evolution of sepsis corresponding to modifications in blood constitution {{being responsible for}} waves of up- or down-regulation of inflammation [201]. The models using ex vivo or in vitro experiments with plasma from septic patients or animals have confirmed the presence of molecules in plasma that may alter cellular functions, even for healthy cells. As a consequence, “cleaning the blood or plasma” using extracorporeal circuit with different membranes or cartridges removing molecules by convection/adsorption/filtration is attractive for clinicians, despite the recent disappointing results of randomized clinical trials [200]. Recently, important proofs for an inflammatory mediation of septic-induced AKI have been reported, stimulating the <b>development</b> of <b>cartridges</b> targeting different plasma molecules [202] with the hope to control systemic inflammation. However, the targeted molecules to be removed remain elusive, since {{the knowledge of the}} positive versus negative components remains a challenge for clinician that is not clarified by the actual biomarkers, cell functions evaluation tests or tissue function tests. Although inflammation and kidney infiltration have been demonstrated to induce AKI, some infiltration might be protective for the tissues. As an example, the inflammatory monocyte (newly recruited) adhesion to renal vascular wall orchestrated by CX 3 CR 1 activation {{has been shown to be}} protective for kidney injury in rat and human beings [203]. The I 249 CX 3 CR 1 allele is associated with both increased monocyte adhesiveness and reduced kidney damage in human septic shock. The strategy of care should focus on components well admitted to induce inflammation and/or tissue damage such as endotoxin or activated cells or both.|$|R
40|$|The toner {{cartridge}} manufacturing industry {{continues to grow}} at a rapid pace. This growth fuels the <b>development</b> of toner <b>cartridge</b> remanufacturing. While many remanufacturers of {{toner cartridge}}s for laser printers replace the recycled organic photoconductive (OPC) drums with new aftermarket ones, others opt to reuse the recycled OPCs. The latter approach yields a savings to the remanufacturer in both material cost and waste, but since the condition of a used drum is unknown, tests must be performed on each individual OPC to determine its reusability. Typically, a recycled OPC is deemed reusable if it passes a visual inspection and/or yields an acceptable output in print testing. Unfortunately, neither of these methods produce quantitative measurements {{that can be used}} to objectively estimate the remaining life of the OPC. In this paper, a method based on a computerized OPC drum scanner for assessing the reusability of recycled OPCs is presented. The method, in conjunction with print testing, visual inspection, and historical data on the OPC type in consideration, has shown to be very effective in predicting the performance of recycled OPCs. Test results to support the validity of this method and its limitations will be discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Some of {{the most}} famous SWC designs were {{developed}} by Elmer Keith for use in handgun hunting. These designs (C) use a wider front, and convex sides on the [...] "cone" [...] in front.

Since Keith was a prime motivating force in the development of the first magnum handgun cartridge, the [...]357 Magnum, he was very interested in maximizing the amount of case volume for the slower burning powders needed to push heavy bullets at high velocities. The choice of bullet for the [...]357 Magnum cartridge varied during its development.

During roughly the 18th century, paper cartridges {{became more and more}} popular, and a higher proportion of flasks made were the smaller priming variety. It appears that the British Army in the Peninsular War, despite regulations specifying the issue of powder horns and priming flasks, found the former inferior in action to cartridges, with the measuring spout prone to get detached and lost, and informally switched to cartridges during the war. The powder flask was finally rendered obsolete by the spread of breech-loading guns and the innovations brought about by Hall, Sharps, Spencer, and the later <b>development</b> of self-contained <b>cartridges</b> that were developed and marketed successfully by Oliver Winchester, after which manufactured cartridges or bullets became standard. Powder flasks were also used for priming naval cannon; such a flask would be as large as, or even larger than, a main flask for a personal sidearm. The large, rectangular boxes from which the main muzzle charges for cannon were scooped are called powder boxes; these were used either when making up cartridges in advance, or loading loose powder when firing.|$|R
40|$|The Fire Cartridge is {{a packed}} bed air filter with two {{different}} and separate layers of media {{designed to provide}} respiratory protection from combustion products after a fire event on the International Space Station (ISS). The first layer of media is a carbon monoxide catalyst and the second layer of media is universal carbon. During <b>development</b> of Fire <b>Cartridge</b> prototypes, the two media beds were noticed to have shifted inside the cartridge. The movement of media within the cartridge can cause mixing of the bed layers, air voids, and channeling, which could cause preferential air flow and allow contaminants to pass through without removal. An optimally packed bed mitigates these risks and ensures effective removal of contaminants from the air. In order to optimally pack each layer, vertical, horizontal, and orbital agitations were investigated and a packed bulk density was calculated for each method. Packed bulk density must be calculated for each media type to accommodate variations in particle size, shape, and density. Additionally, the optimal vibration parameters must be re-evaluated for each batch of media due to variations in particle size distribution between batches. For this application {{it was determined that}} orbital vibrations achieve an optimal pack density and the two media layers can be packed by the same method. Another finding was media with a larger size distribution of particles achieve an optimal bed pack easier than media with a smaller size distribution of particles...|$|R

We recently described a coagulation assay based on surface acoustic waves (SAW) technology, which quantifies anticoagulant effects by image processing. Here we describe {{the first step in}} miniaturizing this laboratory method and provide a portable prototype that contains the optical illumination and automatic on-board image processing. Methods: A device {{about the size of a}} shoebox was realized that contains the SAW-chip, the signal generator, the LED illumination, as well as the necessary lenses, aperture, and CCD sensor. The microspheres in the blood were mixed by SAW, and the movement of the micro spheres was quantified by on-board image processing. Upon contact with activation induced coagulation, this movement ceases, and coagulation times were measured and compared to the manual methods obtained by standard fluorescent microscopy. A major advantage of our method is the low amount of blood (~ 6 μL) necessary for testing. Results: Results from the prototype correlated accurately with manual methods (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0. 9644). SAW-induced clotting time under anticoagulant treatment with dabigatran or rivaroxaban was well correlated with physicochemically determined plasma concentrations of these DOACs in anticoagulated patients. Compared to manual alignment of the chip under the fluorescence microscope, the prototype had a lower coefficient of variation.

This flexibility prompted a boom in the <b>development</b> of wildcat <b>cartridges</b> suitable for the Contender, such as the 7-30 Waters and [...]357 Herrett and the various TCU cartridges, most of which were commonly based on either the widely available [...]30-30 Winchester or [...]223 Remington cases. The largest factory caliber offered for the Contender was the [...]45-70, which, although a much larger case than the [...]308, is still feasible because of the relatively low cartridge pressures of the original black-powder round relative to the limits of the bolt face of the Contender receiver. Custom gunmakers have added to the selection, such as the J. D. Jones line of JDJ cartridges based on the [...]225 Winchester and [...]444 Marlin.
