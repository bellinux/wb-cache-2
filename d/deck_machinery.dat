5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight <b>deck</b> <b>machinery</b> that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E
25|$|Grasp has {{heavy lift}} system that {{consists}} of large bow and stern rollers, <b>deck</b> <b>machinery,</b> and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction fairlead for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and <b>deck</b> <b>machinery</b> provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic lift of 150 tons. The stern rollers {{can be used with}} the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic lift of 150 tons. All four rollers can be used together for a dynamic lift of 300 tons or a static tidal lift of 350 tons.|$|E

25|$|To avoid {{electrical}} interference with her sensitive hydrographic surveying equipment, Explorer′s <b>deck</b> <b>machinery</b> and major auxiliary equipment all {{was driven by}} high-pressure steam. When commissioned, Explorer was considered to have the finest and most extensive hydrographic surveying equipment {{in the history of}} the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s fleet, all entirely electrically powered. The equipment included a fathometer, a Dorsey sonic depth finder, a Hughes automatic depth recorder system, a special taut-wire measuring gear with 120 nautical miles (138 statute miles; 222km) of fine wire and several tons of iron balls, and hydrophones. Electrolysis eliminators mounted to her hull ensured that she would be grounded so as to avoid interference with her electrical surveying equipment.|$|E

40|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by longlining and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining. Both longlining and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and <b>deck</b> <b>machineries</b> like line haulers, chute, shooting and hauling accessories for longlining and special powerful purse winch, power block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|R
