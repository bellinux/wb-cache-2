40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interpretative study {{of decision making}} within <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends.</b> Eighteen <b>groups</b> were observed and interviewed while making leisure decisions. Emerging findings highlight how <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> depart from other groups such as families or buying centers. Among others, communication is less extensive, group cohesivess is weaker, which leads to later decisions and {{to the need for}} leadership in the group. In addition, this study shows that individual preferences are no good predictors <b>of</b> the <b>group</b> choice and that group decision making is not always very effective. What seems the most important is to preserve affective ties between members whatever the outcome of the decision-making process. Finally, an original typology of three types <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> is proposed...|$|R

5|$|In {{junior high}} school, they meet a tall, {{eccentric}} girl who befriends everyone named Chizuru Sarashina and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, {{who does not}} get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing. The <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E

Further, the major issues of conflict and role distribution are discussed. An original typology <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> closes the paper...|$|R

The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session.

This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President {{in charge of}} production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually {{many of the young}} men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E

The film follows a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> who {{fall victim to}} a family of cannibals while {{on their way to}} visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.|$|E

We are designing Pact, a social application in which <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> can collaborate toward goal achievement. We have made novel design decisions involving persuasion and motivation due to our focus on previously established strong social ties. Pact allows individuals to set personally achievable goals, yet encourages both collaboration and competition by allowing friends to compare measurable progress and hold each other accountable...|$|R

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> {{with whom}} he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking {{the effects of the}} various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
