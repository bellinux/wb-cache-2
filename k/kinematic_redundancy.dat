40|$|The human motor {{system is}} highly redundant, having more {{kinematic}} {{degrees of freedom}} than necessary to complete a given task. Understanding how <b>kinematic</b> <b>redundancies</b> are utilized in different tasks remains a fundamental question in motor control. One possibility {{is that they can}} be used to tune the mechanical properties of a limb to the specific requirements of a task. For example, many tasks such as tool usage compromise arm stability along specific directions. These tasks only can be completed if the nervous system adapts the mechanical properties of the arm such that the arm, coupled to the tool, remains stable. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if posture selection is a critical component of endpoint stiffness regulation during unconstrained tasks. Three-dimensional (3 D) estimates of endpoint stiffness were used to quantify limb mechanics. Most previous studies examining endpoint stiffness adaptation were completed in 2 D using constrained postures to maintain a non-redundant mapping between joint angles and hand location. Our hypothesis was that during unconstrained conditions, subjects would select arm postures that matched endpoint stiffness to the functional requirements of the task. The hypothesis was tested during endpoint tracking tasks in which subjects interacted with unstable haptic environments, simulated using a 3 D robotic manipulator. We found that arm posture had a significant effect on endpoint tracking accuracy and that subjects selected postures that improved tracking performance. For environments in which arm posture had a large effect on tracking accuracy, the self-selected postures oriented the direction of maximal endpoint stiffness towards the direction of the unstable haptic environment. These results demonstrate how changes in arm posture can have a dramatic effect on task performance and suggest that postural selection is a fundamental mechanism by which <b>kinematic</b> <b>redundancies</b> can be exploited to regulate arm stiffness in unconstrained tasks...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a control strategy that considers three factors, namely tracking error, discomfort, defined at the joint level, and “effort ” to control the pitch and yaw joints. Our strategy is based on gradient descent on a cost function. During the optimization, we use different step sizes to reflect the different inertia of the moved parts.

40|$|Methods {{for resolving}} <b>kinematic</b> <b>redundancies</b> of {{manipulators}} by {{the effect on}} joint torque are examined. When the generalized inverse is formulated in terms of accelerations and incorporated into the dynamics, the effect of redundancy resolution on joint torque can be directly reflected. One method chooses the joint acceleration null-space vector to minimize joint torque in a least squares sense; when the least squares is weighted by allowable torque range, the joint torques tend to be kept within their limits. Contrasting methods employing only the pseudoinverse with and without weighting by the inertia matrix are presented. The results show an unexpected stability problem during long trajectories for the null-space methods and for the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse method, but rarely for the unweighted pseudoinverse method. Evidently a whiplash action develops over time that thrusts the endpoint off the intended path, and extremely high torques are required to overcome these natural movement dynamics.

Since each link of a manipulator is a moving body relative to other bodies, they form a tree structure of interconnected bodies. Undoutedly, many of these manipulators will possess certain degree of flexibility, at links as well as at joints. To describe accurately the dynamics of such a system in a generic way, is certainly not a trivial task. However, if we approximate each flexible link as a long slender beam and assume that flexible joints behave like torsional springs, a scalar set of equations of motion can be derived explicitly for use in real time simulation or control applications. <b>Kinematic</b> <b>redundancy</b> of manipulators has been used in control algorithms to avoid singularities, evade obstacles, minimize joint torques, manipulator kinetic energy, end effector contact forces, etc [...] . All of these approaches have been associated with rigid manipulators where there are no unpredictable flexible motions. When dealing with flexible manipulators, the flexibility of the system will cause undesired inaccuracy in end effector motion. However, if these manipulators are kinematically redundant, we show in this thesis that their <b>kinematic</b> <b>redundancy</b> can be used to compensate for the end effector motion inaccuracy and in many cases help damp out the vibrations.

Virtual constraints of proper dimension lead to reduced dynamics of dimension two. The reduced dynamics is derived in a generalized way which includes previous results for the case of a single point contact. Control of the reduced dynamics is discussed in particular for the double support case. The derived concept is illustrated for a biped robot walking gait with a double support phase and an underactuated single support phase...|$|R
