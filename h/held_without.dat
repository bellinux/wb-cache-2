5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, {{and came to the}} independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was <b>held</b> <b>without</b> a jury.|$|E
5|$|McNamara's career {{came to an}} unceremonious end in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. Severely hobbled by his leg injury and {{exhausted}} from the run in the Big East tournament, he scored only two points in just 23 minutes of play as fifth-seeded Syracuse was upset by Texas A University. It marked the only game in his career McNamara was <b>held</b> <b>without</b> a field goal. The Orange finished with a 23-12 record.|$|E
5|$|On defense, the Longhorns {{were ranked}} No. 55 nationally in total defense and No. 5 in the Southwest Conference. This was despite a marked {{improvement}} as {{the regular season}} progressed. Through their first six games, the Longhorns allowed 146 points and sacked opposing quarterbacks nine times. In their final six games, Texas allowed 81 points and accumulated 17 sacks. Their 166 win over Texas A {{marked the first time}} that school had been <b>held</b> <b>without</b> a touchdown in a Southwest Conference game in more than a decade.|$|E

5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E
5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|Although Florida outgained the Crimson Tide {{in total}} offense 281 to 273 yards, their three {{turnovers}} resulted in 21 Alabama points. In addition to Mosley, Nico Johnson intercepted Trey Burton {{in the end zone}} and Dre Kirkpatrick intercepted a John Brantley pass. The game marked the first time Florida had been <b>held</b> <b>without</b> a touchdown since their previous visit to Tuscaloosa in 2005, and resulted in Alabama leading the nation in scoring defense by allowing only 45 points through five games. Courtney Upshaw was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week after making seven total tackles, with four for losses, a fumble recovery and two pass deflections. Chance Warmack was recognized as the SEC's Offensive Lineman of the Week for his performance. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 21–14 (22–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory).|$|E

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi {{decided on a}} raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and <b>held</b> <b>without</b> trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on bail while {{awaiting}} a third trial and apparently {{in a highly}} intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of peremptory challenges to again prevent the court from empaneling a jury. The judge ordered him <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who {{was present at the}} proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were <b>held</b> <b>without</b> the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice.|$|E
5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being <b>held</b> <b>without</b> exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large drag mark through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the wishes of the Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E
5|$|Nebiu Demeke {{was arrested}} and charged with air piracy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. He was arraigned on February 12, 1993; Judge Allyne Ross ordered him <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail until his trial. Demeke {{remained}} convinced that he would not spend any time in prison and that he would be granted asylum. During the course of his trial, he was twice found to be incompetent to stand trial and was prescribed medication for depression and hallucinations. He represented himself during the course of his four-day trial. He was found guilty in a jury trial after an hour of deliberation, and Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. sentenced him to prison until 2013.|$|E

5|$|On February 26, 2013 a {{criminal}} case was opened against the band members {{who had participated in}} the Moscow cathedral performance on February 21. On March 3, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, two alleged members of Pussy Riot, were arrested by the Russian authorities and accused of hooliganism. Both women at first denied being members of the group and started a hunger strike in protest against being held in jail away from their young children. The defendants were <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail. On March 16, another woman, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who had earlier been questioned as a witness in the case, was similarly arrested and charged.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be <b>held</b> <b>without</b> the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The quarterfinals {{were held}} at two {{separate}} locations the weekend of May 17 and May 18. On Saturday, 17,017 people attended the quarterfinals at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. This set an attendance record for most number of people to attend the quarterfinal round of the lacrosse championships. Fans in attendance saw Johns Hopkins defeat Navy 10–4. Navy was <b>held</b> <b>without</b> a goal for both {{the second and third}} quarters. The other game played in Annapolis was Maryland versus Virginia, which went into overtime. Ben Rubeor scored the game-winning goal in the extra period to send the Cavaliers to the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also <b>held</b> <b>without</b> light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently <b>held</b> <b>without</b> trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was <b>held</b> <b>without</b> bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
