40|$|The {{main goal}} of this diploma thesis, called <b>Environmental</b> <b>impact</b> {{assessment}} (EIA) in european law, is to explain the procedure of <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment. Emphasis of this diploma thesis is placed on legislation dealing with the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment and its development. The diploma thesis is divided into five chapters, further it contains the introduction, the conclusion, the list of abbreviation, the list of pictures, attachement and the list of literature. Chapter one defines the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment itself and distinguishes the project (EIA) and strategic (SEA) assessment. Chapter two describes the international law concerning the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment. The {{most important part of}} this diploma thesis is chapter three, which contains the analysis of european and czech legislation regarding to the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment. The czech legislation is then compared to legislation of other member states of the EU. Chapter four characterizes the procedure of <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> assessment within the Natura 2000.

5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E

5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bitumen exploitation.

5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues.
