40|$|Naphthalene (C 10 H 8) and {{anthracene}} (C 14 H 10) are simetric organic matter. Both of them predicted didn 2 ̆ 7 t have <b>electrooptic</b> <b>characteristic.</b> That characteristic {{will appear}} if we induce them with external electric field. In the examination, {{it was used}} source light incandescent lamp 100 W. The external electric field generated by HV DC generator of 0 - 7 kV. The electrooptics characteristic was determined by measuring the change of polarization angle of light as it passed through the difference concentration of naphthalene and anthracene while they were applied by external electric field. Based on the result of observation, change of polarization angle of the light was increasing at each different potential between naphthalene (range 0, 30 – 10) and anthracene (range 0, 10 - 0, 70). Beside that, changes of polarization angle of the light was increase linearly to the increase of naphthalene concentration, while anthracene was not. These results consider for more research to do with alternative organic materials in photonic devices...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{investigated}} the LC pretilt property {{according to the}} ion beam exposure conditions on a homeotropic LC alignment. The LCs on a higher energy ion beam-treated surface is aligned almost homogenously. We assumed {{that it may be}} caused by the breaking of the side chain with hydrophobic property in the used polyimide by ion beam exposure. It was confirmed from the result of the contact angle measurement. LC pretilt which may create new LCD applications with excellent <b>electrooptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and good image quality can be controlled by an ion beam condition with proper ion beam parameters.|$|R
30|$|We {{investigate}} the pretilt {{characteristics of a}} nematic liquid crystal [LC] in terms of ion beam exposure conditions on the homeotropic polyimide alignment layer. The pretilt angle of LCs {{in the case of}} high-energy ion beam treatment was decreased considerably almost the same to that of the homogenous alignment layer though we used homeotropic polyimide film at first. Increasing irradiating energy, we could control the pretilt from 90 ° to 1 ° with several steps. We believe that this is because the side chain with hydrophobicity in the used polyimide is broken by ion beam exposure. To confirm it, contact angle measurement was carried out. With this result, we can easily control the LC pretilt in the pixel with appropriate exposure conditions which is critical to achieve excellent <b>electrooptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and good image quality.|$|R
40|$|Dependence of SSFLC <b>electrooptic</b> {{switching}} <b>characteristics</b> and matrix addressing capabilities on cell materials was investigated. Four {{test cells}} {{were made with}} two FLC mixtures, ZLI 4851 - 000 and BDH SCE 8, in combination with two alignment materials, rubbed polymide (Nissan SE 3140) and friction deposited teflon. The cells show a good bistability characterized by memory and symmetric switching. Delay and rise times have been measured and fitted using a uniform director model, allowing a determination of all parameters within this model. Based on this, computed region of operation of normal and fast addressing modes are reported. For both mixtures, teflon aligned cells, compared to polymide aligned cells, show higher elastic restoring torque in the model. For normal addressing modes, teflon cells feature a higher minimum and a lower maximum operating voltage. Furthermore, they allow higher addressing speeds for both normal and fast models...|$|R
40|$|Holographic storage {{experiments}} using crystal Sr(0. 75) Ba(0. 25) Nb 2 O 6 (SBN 75 / 25) as a volume-phase holographic medium {{show that}} this material is the most sensitive crystalline storage medium yet discovered. An exposure level of 0. 003 J/sq cm at 0. 488 micron produces a 1 % diffraction efficiency in a 5 -mm length of crystal. In addition to high recording sensitivity, SBN 75 / 25 exhibits interesting electric-field induced effects that include electric-field enhanced recording sensitivity and voltage-switchable latent-to-active holographic reconstruction efficiency. These effects are {{explained in terms of}} drift and diffusion of photoionized carriers coupled with the nonlinear <b>electrooptic</b> behavior <b>characteristic</b> of this low Curie temperature ferroelectric crystal. A mechanism is proposed that correlates the observed electrically controlled holographic response with the dielectric behavior of the crystal. These interesting effects are used to implement a novel, layered optical memory having no moving parts and having electrical access for writing or reading selected layers...|$|R
