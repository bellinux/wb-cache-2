5|$|DisplayPort {{connector}} {{is compatible}} with HDMI and can trasmit single-link DVI and HDMI 1.2/1.4/2.0 signals using attached passive adapters or adapter cables. The source device includes a <b>dual-mode</b> transmitter which supports both LVDS signals used by DisplayPort and TMDS signals used by DVI/HDMI. The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort <b>Dual-mode</b> ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports <b>Dual-mode</b> passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|E
5|$|DisplayPort uses a self-clocking, micro-packet-based {{protocol}} {{that allows}} for a variable number of differential LVDS lanes as well as flexible allocation of bandwidth between audio and video, and allows encapsulating multi-channel compressed audio formats in the audio stream. DisplayPort 1.2 supports multiple audio/video streams, variable refresh rate (FreeSync), Display Stream Compression (DSC), and <b>Dual-mode</b> LVDS/TDMS transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.2 or 1.4. Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires <b>Dual-mode</b> with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.|$|E
5|$|Metro began {{testing a}} fleet of new hybrid {{diesel-electric}} buses in 2002, intending to use them in the bus tunnel {{before and after the}} conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda <b>dual-mode</b> trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city's trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single <b>dual-mode</b> bus in service on the final day.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{service in}} the bus tunnel began on September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton. The limited service {{was the result of}} delays in the {{manufacturing}} of <b>dual-mode</b> buses from Breda, which were fully delivered in 1991. The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service. A ceremonial walk and run was held on September 9, 1990, and attracted 5,000 participants.|$|E
5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II {{to meet the}} needs of radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as <b>dual-mode</b> cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E
5|$|While demonstrating {{excellent}} results, {{this campaign}} showed {{the need to}} change some of the aerodynamic features of the weapon. To compensate for delays in AASM deliveries in 2008 France ordered <b>dual-mode</b> (laser- and GPS/INS-guided) GBU-49 Enhanced Paveway II kits for integration with Mirage 2000D and Rafale fighter-bombers. The GPS/INS + IIR guided version completed its qualification tests on July 9, 2008 after three firings at the DGA's missile test range in Biscarosse. This 250kg IR version performed a night launch from a Rafale fighter-bomber at DGA's Biscarosse test range in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes to be routed through the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special <b>dual-mode</b> buses for the tunnel, route 41 was not moved into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends and nights. The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service to Sand Point and Lake City.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include <b>Dual-mode</b> trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5|$|Tunnel {{construction}} {{was completed in}} early June 1990, {{a few weeks before}} the June 23 completion of the Waterfront Streetcar extension serving the future station. International District station was dedicated at a public open house during the annual Seafair on July 15, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. The tunnel was served by <b>dual-mode</b> buses that would switch from diesel power to electric trolleybus (supplied by overhead wires) at International District station and Convention Place station, the tunnel's respective termini.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses {{were tested in}} the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by <b>dual-mode</b> buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow <b>dual-mode</b> muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E
5|$|Following the setback of HOTOL's cancellation, in 1989 Alan Bond, {{along with}} John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill decided to {{establish}} their own company, Reaction Engines Limited, to pursue {{the development of a}} viable spaceplane and associated technology using private funding. In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised <b>dual-mode</b> propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development. REL has also sought to form ties with other company with the aim of producing an international consortium of interested firms to participate in the Skylon programme.|$|E
5|$|The Metro Transit Committee {{debated the}} {{inclusion}} of the bus tunnel in the project's environmental impact assessment well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the Seattle City Council and Mayor Charles Royer preferred the transit mall, but stated that a tunnel would be a long-term solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson's proposed <b>dual-mode</b> buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped transit mall.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Harlem and Hudson Lines, {{diesel-powered}} trains {{are driven by}} BL20-GH and <b>dual-mode</b> Genesis P32AC-DM locomotives, paired with Shoreliner coaches. While some peak-period trains operate directly to and from Grand Central Terminal with Genesis P32AC-DM <b>dual-mode</b> locomotives only, most New Haven Line diesel-only territory is operated as shuttle service between Danbury and South Norwalk, or between Waterbury and Bridgeport.|$|E
25|$|Brimstone {{was used}} {{extensively}} during Operation Ellamy over Libya in 2011. According to a British Ministry of Defence News report, dated 26 March 2011, RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft launched several Brimstone missiles over {{the towns of}} Misrata and Ajdabiya destroying {{a total of five}} armoured vehicles belonging to the Gaddafi regime. Sixty Brimstone were fired in the first four weeks of the Libya campaign, out of 110 Brimstone fired in all operations up to that time. This prompted the MoD to ask MBDA to convert more missiles to the <b>dual-mode</b> version. 150 <b>dual-mode</b> missiles had been ordered in December 2010, but according to the Royal United Services Institute, stocks of usable <b>dual-mode</b> missiles fell to single figures at one stage of the Libya campaign. The 500th <b>dual-mode</b> Brimstone was delivered in March 2012, at which time over 200 had been fired in combat. The single-mode missile was not fired in combat until 15 September 2011 when a pair of RAF Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron fired 22 missiles (including a salvo of 12 by one aircraft) against an armoured column near Sebha/Sabha, 400 miles south of Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|When <b>dual-mode</b> buses {{were placed}} in service on December 31, 2004, two routes, dubbed SL2 and SL3, began service. As still not enough <b>dual-mode</b> buses were available, some rush-hour service was {{provided}} by CNG buses, with transfers at Silver Line Way. Through service was suspended after January 5, 2005, and was not brought back until March 5, with all buses <b>dual-mode</b> starting on March 14. Beginning on March 26, late night and weekend trips ran combined, running both around the BMIP loop and to City Point. The SL3 service ran to City Point via the Boston Marine Industrial Park; however, its ridership was low due to competition from the parallel 7 bus. The 7 is frequent (with 6-minute headways during rush hour), cost less and runs to Downtown Crossing rather than just to South Station. SL3 service was canceled in March 2009.|$|E

25|$|Agence métropolitaine de {{transport}} (AMT) {{operates the}} ALP-45DP <b>dual-mode</b> electro-diesel locomotives for the Repentigny-Mascouche Line (AMT). They run as electric {{while in the}} poorly ventilated Mount Royal Tunnel, otherwise they run as diesel locomotives.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR {{also uses}} 134 C3 Bilevel coaches powered by 23 DE30AC {{diesel-electric}} locomotives and 21 DM30AC <b>dual-mode</b> locomotives. They are used mostly on non-electrified territories, including the Port Jefferson, Oyster Bay, Montauk, and Greenport Branches.|$|E
25|$|Diagonal horn – This simple <b>dual-mode</b> horn superficially {{looks like}} a {{pyramidal}} horn with a square output aperture. On closer inspection, however, the square output aperture is seen to be rotated 45° relative to the waveguide. These horns are typically machined into split blocks and used at sub-mm wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Muni has {{implemented}} a <b>dual-mode</b> smart card payment system known as Clipper (formerly TransLink). The transponders {{have been in}} use since at least 2004, and replaced most paper monthly passes in 2010. BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, VTA, AC Transit, SamTrans, and San Francisco Bay Ferry also utilize the Clipper system.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 2014, the MBTA {{approved}} a $18.5 {{million contract with}} Maine Military Authority to overhaul the 32 <b>dual-mode</b> buses. After several buses were delivered, the contract was renegotiated in 2016. , half the fleet had been overhauled and returned to service, with the remainder expected {{by the end of}} 2017.|$|E
25|$|Railpower offers hybrid {{electric}} road switchers, as does GE. Diesel-electric locomotives may {{not always}} be considered HEVs, not having energy storage on board, unless they are fed with electricity via a collector for short distances (for example, in tunnels with emission limits), in which case they are better classified as <b>dual-mode</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} Have Dash II {{missiles were}} recoverable, and utilised Rocketdyne Mk 58 solid-fueled rocket motors {{of the same}} type used by the AIM-7 Sparrow. Production missiles {{were expected to be}} powered by a ramjet engine, and would use inertial navigation during the cruise phase of flight, with a <b>dual-mode</b> infrared/active radar seeker head for terminal guidance.|$|E
25|$|All {{station tracks}} are powered by 12 kV {{overhead}} wire. Tracks 5–21 also have 750 V DC third rail. Due {{to the lack}} of proper ventilation in the tunnels and station, only electric locomotives and <b>dual-mode</b> locomotives are scheduled to enter Penn Station. Diesel-only NJT trains terminate at Hoboken Terminal or Newark Penn Station, and diesel-only LIRR trains terminate at or prior to Long Island City.|$|E
25|$|The tail {{surfaces}} have {{a span of}} 0.82m when deployed after the missile leaves the launch container by a spring mechanism. Four gas-control vanes operating in the motor efflux turn the missile towards the required direction of flight. After the turnover manoeuvre, {{they are no longer}} used and subsequent flight controlled via moving {{tail surfaces}}. A <b>dual-mode</b> solid-propellant rocket motor provides the missile with a maximum speed of Mach 4.5.|$|E
25|$|SL1 {{service to}} Logan Airport began on an interim basis on January 2, 2005. CNG buses ran on a Sunday-only (4 pm–10 pm only) shuttle route between Silver Line Way and the airport terminals. The {{agreement}} with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection had called for airport service by January, but the MBTA {{did not yet have}} enough <b>dual-mode</b> buses for full service. Full-time SL1 service began on June 1, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Five {{additional}} all-electric battery-powered buses {{will enter}} service in 2018 {{to increase the}} fleet size for the Chelsea extension. An option order on a separate bus order with New Flyer allowed the MBTA to order a single diesel bus {{with the ability to}} travel solely on battery power for several miles. If that test bus is deemed successful, the MBTA can purchase 45 additional such buses to fully replace the <b>dual-mode</b> fleet.|$|E
25|$|In March 2005, Brimstone entered {{service with}} No. 31 Squadron RAF. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was {{declared}} for the Tornado GR4 in December 2005 The first operational sortie of <b>dual-mode</b> Brimstone was over Iraq {{as part of}} Operation Telic on 18 December 2008 by a Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron. It was first fired in combat in June 2009, the month that the Tornado GR4's of 12 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} and procurement {{of the original}} single-mode missiles cost £370m, a figure inflated by accounting charges relating to the delays. The development of the <b>dual-mode</b> version cost an additional £10m. The Daily Telegraph reported that the dual mode missiles cost £105,000, which {{is comparable to the}} cost of the AGM-65 Maverick; the MoD quote only a gross book value of £175,000, which includes development costs as well as the purchase cost of the missile. Upgrading a single-mode missile to dual mode costs between £35,000 and £45,000 plus VAT, depending on quantities ordered.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to provide service {{intermediate}} in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects using Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the Silver Line, although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved bus lanes, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by <b>dual-mode</b> buses, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power {{for the rest of}} the route.|$|E
25|$|The {{tunneled}} section extending east of South Station, {{known as}} Silver Line Phase II, {{was constructed in}} conjunction with Boston's Big Dig and was originally {{referred to as the}} South Boston Piers Transitway. Tunnel sections were fabricated in a nearby, World War II–era dry dock and floated into place. Phase II opened on Friday, December 17, 2004, with the first route (Silver Line Waterfront) running only to Silver Line Way, temporarily using new electric trolley buses borrowed from the trackless trolley routes that have their hub in Cambridge, as not enough <b>dual-mode</b> buses were available initially.|$|E
25|$|Guidance {{was planned}} to be {{provided}} during mid-course flight by an inertial navigation system, while terminal guidance would use a <b>dual-mode</b> seeker. Propulsion would be provided by an integrated rocket-ramjet, which would act as a solid-fuel rocket during boost, with the rocket's casing, following exhaustion of its propellant and the ejection of the rocket nozzle and a fairing covering an air inlet, becoming a combustion chamber for an air-breathing ramjet, which was planned to use Shelldyne-H fuel. The missile {{was expected to be}} carried by the B-1 bomber, or alternatively by a developed version of the FB-111.|$|E
25|$|Oligonucleotide microarrays often carry control probes {{designed}} to hybridize with RNA spike-ins. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins {{and the control}} probes is used to normalize the hybridization measurements for the target probes. Although absolute levels of gene expression may be determined in the two-color array in rare instances, the relative differences in expression among different spots within a sample and between samples is the preferred method of data analysis for the two-color system. Examples of providers for such microarrays includes Agilent with their <b>Dual-Mode</b> platform, Eppendorf with their DualChip platform for colorimetric Silverquant labeling, and TeleChem International with Arrayit.|$|E
25|$|In North America, the {{flexibility}} of diesel locomotives and the relative low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter {{is the use of}} electric locomotives by Amtrak and commuter railroads in the Northeast. New Jersey Transit New York corridor uses ALP-46 electric locomotives, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in Penn Station and the Hudson and East River Tunnels leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Stations use <b>dual-mode</b> locomotives that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station. Electric locomotives are planned for the California High Speed Rail system.|$|E
