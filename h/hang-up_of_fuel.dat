Eliza Gray comments on a comparison and contrast of the two religions, asserting that “at the core of both religions is a never-ending pursuit of a better self. In the case of Scientology, that best self is ‘clear’ of residual traumas buried in the subconscious. In the Nation Islam, that self is free <b>of</b> <b>hang-ups</b> <b>of</b> white culture that black people have internalized to their detriment.” Farrakhan has taught his followers to seek truth wherever it is contained, despite the inherent contradiction of following Hubbard’s teaching while he poses resistance to the “whites.” He declares to his followers that L. Ron Hubbard has made “white people better than they are,” describing Hubbard’s Dianetics {{as a way for}} “whites to expunge themselves from ‘devilish’ qualities.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} lignocelluloses {{materials}} to pyrolyze into bio-fuel {{depends on the}} amount of heat transferred supply to the biomass feed. Typically,by using fixed bed pyrolysis system,heat is supplied through the reactor wall. In this research,the effects of heat distribution inside the combustion chamber of direct fired pyrolysis system is studied to look the effectiveness heat transfer process from gas burner to the reactor. The experiment of different setting <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and air <b>of</b> gas burner was done. The settings are 16 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 2. 5 of air, 16 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 5 <b>of</b> air, 16 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 7. 5 of air, 19 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 2. 5 of air, 19 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 5 <b>of</b> air,and 19 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 7. 5 of air.

The different type of the setting <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and air for gas burner will influence the heat distribution in the gas fired pyrolysis system. The results of the heat distribution of the furnace show similar pattern for 6 different setting but the temperature value were different.

Kubrick often clashed with Shelley Winters, whom he found [...] "very difficult" [...] and demanding, and nearly fired at one point. Because of its provocative story, Lolita was Kubrick's first film to {{generate}} controversy; he was ultimately forced to comply with censors and remove much of the erotic element {{of the relationship between}} Mason's Humbert and Lyon's Lolita which had been evident in Nabokov's novel. The film was not a major critical or commercial success upon release, earning $3.7 million at the box office on its opening run. Lolita has since become acclaimed by film critics. Social historian Stephen E. Kercher documented that the film [...] "demonstrated that its director possessed a keen, satiric insight into the social landscape and sexual <b>hang-ups</b> <b>of</b> cold war America", while Jon Fortgang of Film4 wrote: [...] "Lolita, with its acute mix of pathos and comedy, and Mason's mellifluous delivery of Nabokov's sparkling lines, remains the definitive depiction of tragic transgression".|$|R
