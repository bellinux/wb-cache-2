5|$|As a freshman, Cabral <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> plantar fascia tear while waterskiing and did {{not compete}} in cross country. He did not compete in the steeplechase until his sophomore season at Princeton. In his second time running the event, he won at the 2010 Penn Relays. That year he was the Ivy League outdoor 10,000 meter and steeplechase {{champion}} and the indoor runner-up in the 3000 meters and 5000 meters. He finished second at the NCAA championships {{with a time of}} 8:38.90.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|At the June 2012 Pangos All-American Camp, Alexander was {{selected}} as the Most Outstanding Player. Alexander, who was already a top 5 recruit according to some sources, <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> Summer 2012 foot injury that sidelined him. By mid-July 2012, as ESPN's number 10 ranked prospect, he received an offer from Kentucky and was being recruited by DePaul, Indiana, Ohio State and Wisconsin. Upon receiving his offer from Kentucky, he told Rivals.com that his two leading schools were Kentucky and Michigan State.|$|E

Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, {{after the}} city's {{residents}} had <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and {{an influx of}} people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{had some}} success after being reformed, winning the 1902 Scottish Cup and their first league {{championship}} a year later. After this, however, the club <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> long barren spell. The club lost its placing in the league, and were relegated {{for the first time}} in 1931, although they were promoted back to the top division two years later. The notorious Scottish Cup drought began as they reached three cup finals, two in consecutive years, but lost each of them.|$|E

J. Yeldon. The injury caused him to miss the next three games. On December 13, Yeldon suffered the same injury against the Indianapolis Colts making way for Robinson to tally 75 yards on 14 carries and his first and only touchdown of the season that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Chelsea and transitions undergone {{by the two}} clubs during the mid-2000s meant the rivalry became insignificant. Manchester United continued to compete for honours under Ferguson, winning 14 over the next 9 years, while Wenger at Arsenal <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> nine-year trophy drought. This was parralled with Wenger making the decision to displace experienced first-teamers in favour of youth and encourage a more fluid, less direct style of football.|$|E

5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date, and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> temporary closure due to unanticipated wear and tear from August 1014.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> {{period where}} {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|Following Bilić's departure, former {{player and}} pundit Igor Štimac was {{appointed}} {{manager of the}} national team. Croatia's all-time top goalscorer Davor Šuker also took over {{as president of the}} Croatian Football Federation (HNS) after the death of Vlatko Marković ended a 14-year tenure. Štimac's managerial campaign was unsuccessful, as the team <b>endured</b> <b>a</b> succession of poor performances and narrowly finished second in their 2014 World Cup qualifying group. After only a year of his appointment, Štimac was replaced by former captain Niko Kovač, who previously managed the under-21 youth side. Kovač led the team to a 2–0 aggregate victory against Iceland in the qualifying playoffs for the 2014 World Cup, with both goals coming in the home leg in Zagreb.|$|E
