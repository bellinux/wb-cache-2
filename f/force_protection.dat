5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade {{focused on}} {{bridging}} projects as was its specialty, but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects {{throughout the country}} for much of 2003 and into 2004.

This new mission for the company was essential for <b>force</b> <b>protection,</b> troop transportation, search and cordon operations, and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges. In September 2003, with the inactivation of the 38th Engineer Company (Medium Girder Bridge), the 502nd Engineer Company became a multi-role bridge company with both float and fixed bridging capabilities and the only active bridge company in USAREUR.|$|E

5|$|The last STTT, {{formed around}} 2nd Battalion, The Light Infantry, left Sierra Leone {{at the end}} of September 2001. Approximately 8,500 SLA {{personnel}} were trained by the STTTs, which were replaced by the International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT)—an organisation formed of personnel from countries including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with the UK providing the largest contingent as well as an infantry company for <b>force</b> <b>protection.</b> The STTTs also formed a small special forces unit within the SLA—the Force Reconnaissance Unit (FRU)—to provide a morale boost and to give soldiers something to which they could aspire. Later in 2001, the British Army advised the Sierra Leonean government on a merger of Sierra Leone's armed forces into a unified command, which became the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces in early 2002. In 2008, the permanent British contingent in Sierra Leone was reduced to 100 personnel. British soldiers remained in Sierra Leone as of 2013, continuing to form part of the IMATT, whose size has further reduced in accordance with the increased capabilities of the Sierra Leone armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Reconstruction Taskforce (RTF) based {{around the}} 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with {{protective}} elements from the 5/7 RAR, 6 RAR and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Slipper. The RTF formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt. However, as the Australian commitment expanded, by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion-sized battle group consisting of infantry, engineers, cavalry, artillery and logistic elements, usually based on {{a unit of the}} Royal Australian Regiment. Known as the Mentoring Task Force (MTF), it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces. Partnered with the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army (ANA), it operated throughout Uruzgan Province. While attached to MTF-1, soldiers from Combat Team Delta (based on D Company, 6 RAR) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in Deh Rahwod on 24 August 2010. Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia {{for his role in the}} battle, the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award. The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces, although a small <b>force</b> <b>protection</b> element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and advisory mission. Twelve members of the regiment have been killed in Afghanistan.|$|E
