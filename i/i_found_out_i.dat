500|$|The team's uniform did {{not change}} {{significantly}} after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase [...] "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept {{as a way to}} expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, William Broyles, Jr. {{turned down}} the chance to write the script, but decided to sign on [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> could have an {{extensive}} amount of creative control". Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet [...] "Aschlar". Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of people, I was affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." [...] Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. [...] "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original Apes when I was the head of Fox in 1967." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2012 US Olympic Trials, Brooks {{threw the}} shot put [...] on her second attempt. The {{distance}} held {{up and she}} won third place.

[...] She also mentions Janet Jackson as a primary influence. At the same time, she went to [...] "every 'N Sync concert there was." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death at 27, Cosby was working toward his {{doctorate}} in special education at Columbia University's Teachers College. He planned to set up a school for children with learning disabilities. He once wrote, [...] "The happiest day of my life occurred when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was dyslexic. I believe that life is finding solutions, and the worst feeling to me is confusion." [...] Ennis was recalled as friendly and outgoing, and he would greet people with, [...] "Hello, friend," [...] a greeting that became his legacy. His parents had the phrase put on a sign near his grave, and several months after his death, his father released a jazz collection titled, Hello, Friend: To Ennis With Love.|$|E
2500|$|Early into New York Islanders {{training}} camp, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, having {{played the}} previous {{season in the}} KHL, was deeply saddened by the news and {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I think I knew 80 percent of the team. Either I played with them or I played against them. You see each other in different tournaments. Some of them you're really close with, or some them you just say hi and have a couple of laughs with. [...] It struck me when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough. You have chills and you just hope that the families will find the strength to fight through something like that." ...|$|E
50|$|And so I'm {{telling you}} as my {{superior}} about what <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> am telling you, {{and you are}} wise and you should keep these words for yourself, so that no many people know, and you should take proper guard.|$|R

5000|$|Singer Russ Rankin later {{remarked that}} [...] "I think A Comprehensive Guide to Moderne Rebellion is {{important}} because that's when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that <b>I</b> was a song-writer ... it was where I realized like, 'Hey I guess I'm the song writer for this band.|$|R
2500|$|In 1960, Reynolds and Autry {{founded the}} Major League Baseball {{expansion}} team the Los Angeles Angels. [...] At {{the time that}} he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a [...] "baseball man" [...] and his long relationship with Autry:"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, 'occurred the minute we were given the franchise, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> had a little personal investment at stake.' … 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. [...] 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. NOw we have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{very soon}} {{find out whether}} I'm a fool or not! I mean it! Do you think I'd stay here one second after <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that <b>I</b> was {{injuring}} you? At least I have enough sense of justice not to do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{mad about}} the mistakes, but don't {{care enough to}} cry.

5000|$|On 28 November 2014, it was {{announced}} that Keane had reprised his role for Neighbours 30th anniversary celebrations. Stefan Dennis told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that bringing Keane back was one of his ideas and the producers ran with it. Keane was surprised to receive the call from producers and was initially unaware that Neighbours was turning 30. He explained, [...] "I had a few reservations - Im a Sydney boy, and the Neighbours studios in Melbourne are a long way away But once <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>Id</b> be working with Stefan, it was like, What the hell! You only live once!." [...] Keane was also [...] "fearful" [...] about returning, but the experience helped bring him peace and he commented [...] "I had so much fun this time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day.

[...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot."

In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E

Do you think it was?" ...|$|R

But <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was mistaken. An old negro woman recognized this young person as the daughter of my younger sister you know there were three of us.

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Blinder, [...] "he {{was nothing}} but a follerers. When he first came to lodge here, I didn't know what he was, and I confess that when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> gave him notice. It wasn't liked in the yard. It wasn't approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a genteel calling," [...] said Mrs. Blinder, [...] "and most people do object to it. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger, though his temper has been hard tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you loved her, Hugh," [...] she said.

6000|$|... "I {{liked them}} the more, {{because it was}} just like her last reading with us, and like that letter. Well, then I {{wondered}} as I lay on the grass at Groveswood, whether she would have thought it best for me to be reinstated, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that <b>I</b> should have been rather afraid of what you might say when she had talked it over with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Egad! I kept {{my arrival}} at years of {{discretion}} at Brighton. I {{believe it was}} the last fun there ever was at the Pavilion. The poor dear king, God bless him! proposed my health, and made the devil's own speech; we all began to pipe. He was Regent then. Your father was there, Valentine; ask him if he remembers it. That was a scene! I won't say how it ended; but the best joke is, I got a letter from my governor a few days after, with an account of what they had all been doing at Brandingham, and rowing me for not coming down, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> had kept my coming of age the wrong day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Queen Anne. You are right--I'm not {{frivolous}} at heart. But there's {{a sort of}} frivolous {{skin over}} my soul and I can't take it off. As Mrs. Poyser says, I'd have to be hatched over again and hatched different before I could change it. But Jonas knows the real me and loves me, frivolity and all. And I love him. I never was so surprised in my life as I was when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> loved him. I'd never thought it possible {{to fall in love}} with an ugly man. Fancy me coming down to one solitary beau. And one named Jonas! But I mean to call him Jo. That's such a nice, crisp little name. I couldn't nickname Alonzo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw at last!

I felt like a child who had marched off from home, fancying it can find its way, and is lost at once. I {{did not know that}} I had a Father in heaven who had been looking after me, when I fancied I was looking after myself. I don't half believe it now." [...] .

6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> this, <b>I</b> turned so faint that I {{wanted to}} sit down and cover up my head.
