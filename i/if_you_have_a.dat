5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

[...] Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee wrote that Lee reaches a conclusion that [...] "Love will guide you home." [...] Talking about the lyrical content of the song, Laurie Tuffrey of NME opined: [...] "It's quite hard to tell what the song's about, with lots of references to 'the unknown' and 'the pain', and it confusingly switches between suggesting people 'do what you want you want, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dream for better' in the first verse and the decidedly creepier final chorus where Lee seemingly gets an ex-lover on the blower, only to tell them 'Hello, hello, it’s only me, infecting everything you love'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts. The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{opens with}} rapid drums and soon moves into a guitar-driven mode, {{accompanied}} by synthesizers. Throughout the song, Lee uses [...] "pseudo operatic" [...] and [...] "poppy" [...] vocals. In the opening lines, she sings: [...] "Do what you, {{what you want}} / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dream for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore." [...] Those sounds are followed by a hard rock surging guitar and strings which were noted {{to be part of}} the band's characteristic sound. The chorus is instrumentally complete with crashing cymbals, [...] "thrashing, high-wired rawk" [...] guitars, electric guitars, keyboards and piano as Lee sings, [...] "Hello, hello, remember me? I’m everything you can’t control / Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe we can break through." [...] At the end of the song, Lee shouts the hook [...] "Do what you, what you want," [...] as her vocals are echoed and eventually fade away. Laurie Tuffrey of NME summarized the song as a [...] "standard goth-pop fare, full of rapid drum breaks, swathes of fuzzy riffing and a catchy, chant-friendly chorus." [...] Overally, Scott Shetler of Pop Crush described its production as [...] "polished".|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{started in}} February 2012. Hooper {{investigated}} filming the feature in 3D, and performed some camera tests {{before deciding to}} film it with traditional 2D methods. He stated [...] " [...] I slightly worry with 3D that some people will physically struggle with it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> certain type of eyesight it can be more demanding than watching a normal movie." [...] Unlike other musical films, Les Misérables features the actors singing live on camera, rather than miming to backing vocals. Hooper told Los Angeles Times that he {{thought there was a}} [...] "slightly strange falseness" [...] when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings. The actors wore wireless earpieces on set so they could sing to accompanying piano music. Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs: [...] "When Annie [...] is singing 'I Dreamed a Dream', if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it, or to have an emotion before she sings a line, she can take it." [...] The actors also performed their songs in recitative style, which Hooper likened to being immersed in a 3D film. Les Miserables was released in North America on 25 December 2012, and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Lee shares writing credits {{with other}} members of the band on 11 of the standard-edition album's 12 songs. Evenescence first track and lead single, [...] "What You Want", was {{described}} as one of the band's most unusual songs with heavy guitar melodies, loud drums and a freedom theme. Opening with drums and a synchronized synthesizer, Lee sings [...] "Do what you, what you want / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dream for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore" [...] before the song's rhythmic, guitar-driven beat. Lyrically, the song explores a relationship which is not working out, despite present love. [...] "Made of Stone", one of the album's oldest songs, has heavy-metal influences. [...] "The Change" [...] (originally entitled [...] "Purple"), which begins gently and grows more insistent, has been compared to [...] "Digital Bath" [...] by the American alternative metal band Deftones. The fourth track (and second single), [...] "My Heart Is Broken", is a ballad written for harp and recorded with a piano. It begins with the piano and Lee's vocals, evolving into rhythmic guitars and strings. In the chorus Lee sings, [...] "I will never find a way to heal my soul/ And I will wander 'til the end of time/ Torn away from you/ My heart is broken".|$|E
