40|$|At {{the time}} our November 24, 2004 report was written, {{depleted}} uranium {{was considered a}} “source material ” under the Atomic Energy Act and its possible classification, if declared a waste, had not been formally addressed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC staff and analysts at Sandia National Laboratory had argued previously that the depleted uranium from an enrichment facility should be considered Class A low-level waste under 10 CFR 61. 55 (a) (6), since uranium isotopes were not included among the radionuclides listed for Class B or C wastes, but the Commission had made no such ruling. 1 The analysis we presented in our November 2004 report demonstrated that, with respect to its radiological properties, depleted uranium is most analogous to Transuranic (TRU) or Greater than Class C waste, {{and that it would}} require similar care for disposal.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the 1940 s, one mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies has been processing uranium {{as a source of}} nuclear material for defense and commercial purposes. A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium- 235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover "tails" of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium- 235 compared with natural uranium. Since 1993, uranium enrichment activities at DOE-owned uranium enrichment plants have been performed by the U. S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), formerly a wholly owned government corporation that was privatized in 1998. However, DOE still maintains approximately 700, 000 metric tons of <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> <b>tails</b> in about 63, 000 metal cylinders in storage yards at its Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, enrichment plants. It must safely maintain these cylinders because the tails are dangerous to human health and the environment. Uranium hexafluoride is radioactive and forms extremely corrosive and potentially lethal compounds if it contacts water. DOE also maintains large inventories of natural and enriched uranium that are also surplus to the department's needs. Tails have historically been viewed as a waste product because considerable enrichment processing is required to further extract the remaining useful quantities of uranium- 235. In the past, low uranium prices meant that these enrichment services would cost more than the relatively small amount of uranium- 235 extracted would be worth. However, an approximately tenfold increase in uranium prices [...] from approximately $ 21 per kilogram of uranium in the form of uranium hexafluoride in November 2000 to about $ 200 per kilogram in February 2008 [...] has potentially made it profitable to re-enrich some tails to further extract uranium- 235. Even with the current higher uranium prices, however, only DOE's tails with higher concentrations of uranium- 235 (at least 0. 3 percent) could currently be profitably re-enriched, according to industry officials. About one-third of DOE's tails contain uranium- 235 concentrations at that level or higher. In this context, Congress asked us to determine (1) DOE's potential options for beneficially reusing or indefinitely storing its tails, and (2) the potential value of DOE's tails and factors that affect the value. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report was performed under {{a grant from the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to describe and compare the merits of two advanced alternative nuclear fuel cycles [...] named by this study as the “UREX+ 3 c fuel cycle” and the “Alternative Fuel Cycle” (AFC). Both fuel cycles were assumed to support 100 1, 000 MWe light water reactor (LWR) nuclear power plants operating over the period 2020 through 2100, and the fast reactors (FRs) necessary to burn the plutonium and minor actinides generated by the LWRs. Reprocessing in both fuel cycles is assumed {{to be based on the}} UREX+ 3 c process reported in earlier work by the DOE. Conceptually, the UREX+ 3 c process provides nearly complete separation of the various components of spent nuclear fuel in order to enable recycle of reusable nuclear materials, and the storage, conversion, transmutation and/or disposal of other recovered components. Output of the process contains substantially all of the plutonium, which is recovered as a 5 : 1 uranium/plutonium mixture, in order to discourage plutonium diversion. Mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for recycle in LWRs is made using this 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture plus appropriate makeup uranium. A second process output contains all of the recovered uranium except the uranium in the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture. The several other process outputs are various waste streams, including a stream of minor actinides that are stored until they are consumed in future FRs. For this study, the UREX+ 3 c fuel cycle is assumed to recycle only the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture to be used in LWR MOX fuel and to use <b>depleted</b> <b>uranium</b> (<b>tails)</b> for the makeup uranium. This fuel cycle is assumed not to use the recovered uranium output stream but to discard it instead. On the other hand, the AFC is assumed to recycle both the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture and all of the recovered uranium. In this case, the recovered uranium is reenriched with the level of enrichment being determined by the amount of recovered plutonium and the combined amount of the resulting MOX. The study considered two sub-cases within each of the two fuel cycles in which the uranium and plutonium from the first generation of MOX spent fuel (i) would not be recycled to produce a second generation of MOX for use in LWRs or (ii) would be recycled to produce a second generation of MOX fuel for use in LWRs. The study also investigated the effects of recycling MOX spent fuel multiple times in LWRs. The study assumed that both fuel cycles would store and then reprocess spent MOX fuel that is not recycled to produce a next generation of LWR MOX fuel and would use the recovered products to produce FR fuel. The study further assumed that FRs would begin to be brought on-line in 2043, eleven years after recycle begins in LWRs, when products from 5 -year cooled spent MOX fuel would be available. Fuel for the FRs would be made using the uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides recovered from MOX. For the cases where LWR fuel was assumed to be recycled one time, the 1 st generation of MOX spent fuel was used to provide nuclear materials for production of FR fuel. For the cases where the LWR fuel was assumed to be recycled two times, the 2 nd generation of MOX spent fuel was used to provide nuclear materials for production of FR fuel. The number of FRs in operation was assumed to increase in successive years until the rate that actinides were recovered from permanently discharged spent MOX fuel equaled the rate the actinides were consumed by the operating fleet of FRs. To compare the two fuel cycles, the study analyzed recycle of nuclear fuel in LWRs and FRs and determined the radiological characteristics of irradiated nuclear fuel, nuclear waste products, and recycle nuclear fuels. It also developed a model to simulate the flows of nuclear materials that could occur in the two advanced nuclear fuel cycles over 81 years beginning in 2020 and ending in 2100. Simulations projected the flows of uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides as these nuclear fuel materials were produced and consumed in a fleet of 100 1, 000 MWe LWRs and in FRs. The model also included recycle and reuse of extant inventories of spent LWR fuel. The results of the simulations allowed comparisons of the two fuel cycles from the standpoints of cost, non-proliferation, radiological health, wastes generated, and sustainability. Results of the research also provide insights regarding (i) multiple recycling of uranium and plutonium from spent MOX fuel in LWRs, (ii) costs and benefits of reenriching and reusing uranium from spent LWR fuel; (iii) effects of using uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides from LWR spent fuels to produce fuel for FRs; (iv) net rates of consumption (burning) in FRs of actinide elements produced in LWRs, and (v) ependencies of and interactions among the different systems of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle [...] and the flows of nuclear materials between these systems...|$|E
