One such ending reveals that, from {{the wreckage of the}} Emperor Worm's scaffold, red eyes are <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, which perhaps suggests that the Worm survives. Should the player fail to defeat the Emperor Worm, then it becomes crowned as the new leader of the Empire of Man.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Japanese {{pavilion}} at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color-coordinated magician's attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. Kusama's later installation I'm Here, but Nothing (2000â€“2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, {{saying to}} his {{geophysicist}} Chris Van Galder {{that he would}} return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk {{in the snow and}} play hockey in the airport's hangar for a substitution, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went for a walk in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10m (32ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body. [...] Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.|$|E
50|$|Both blacklight and <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark inks {{have been}} used for tattooing. <b>Glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark ink absorbs and retains light, and then <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> darkened {{conditions}} by process of phosphorescence. Blacklight ink does not <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, but reacts to non-visible UV light, producing a visible glow by fluorescence. The resulting glow of both these inks is highly variable.|$|R
