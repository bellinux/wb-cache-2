40|$|The Author (2015). States face a dilemma: {{international}} law obliges them to protect individuals in certain contexts, {{but that may}} require them to harbour alleged criminals. If such individuals cannot be surrendered or deported, states have to find another means to <b>ensure</b> <b>prosecution</b> and avoid impunity. Unless the International Criminal Court can assume jurisdiction, the haven state is arguably required to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction. Yet, this is not straightforward. Governments are drafting policies in isolation that focus only on their specific needs ç usually involving a simple removal of the individual from that state ç such that protection offered through international human rights law and non-impunity are both ignored and remain unaddressed. This article explores {{the scope of the}} obligation to protect under international refugee law and/or international human rights law; the capacity of states to prosecute, including how jurisdiction might be asserted; and, most importantly, gaps in the existing systems, so as to shape the debate about devising a coherent response that respects both human rights and non-impunity under {{international law}} and does not ignore the comity of nations...|$|E

This paper identified and reviewed three major determinants of compliance with the procurement guidelines to include Familiarity with the procurement guidelines, Fraudulent Practices, and Influencing Projects awards.

The main {{objective}} is to evaluate the control and audit of state budget in the Czech Republic and provide recommendations. To achieve this objective, content analysis of literature and laws is done. Then based on the database of Budget Practices and Procedures Database, analysis of the responses of OECD countries is made. According to responses from the database, tables that compare the internal audit, external audit and performance audit {{carried out by the}} supreme audit institutions are compiled. From obtained knowledge and appreciation of the situation in the Czech Republic recommendations are proposed. In the area of internal audit is strictly necessary to separate the internal auditing function and increase the number of performance audits. In the area of external audit is essential to strengthen the powers of the Supreme Audit Office and legislatively adjust the annual audit of state budget. For the implementation of a performance audit carried out by the supreme audit institutions is necessary to eliminate the mistake in the law on the Supreme Audit Office, where it is not requirement of control effectiveness.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of Laws DegreeThe main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the veracity of penal law objectives in child abuse cases in Kenya. The Children's Act under Section 2 looks at child abuse as consisting physical, sexual, psychological and mental injury. The research endeavours to cover the various forms of child abuse covered by various pieces of legislation, which are sexual abuse, child physical abuse and child trafficking and exploitation. The area is of interest due to a significant rise in child abuse incidences in the country over the years. One of the objectives of laws is to bring about social order in its purest form with an end to avoid conflict. As such to maintain this order the characteristic response of Kenyan legislate:·" to these atrocities was to pass laws that gave unlimited judicial discretion in sentencing and also severe deterrent punishments. From collected data over a span of 10 years since the enforcement of key legislations, the trend of child abuse crimes across the board have increased in conviction rates, prosecutions and arrests. The question then is whether the objective of the laws is responsible for this inefficiency. To figure out the whether a nexus exists thejurisdiction of Canada was used as a comparative study. The Canadian criminal system, based on Common law, is similar to that of Kenya. The similarity of judicial systems and similar child protection laws provided a proper specimen to analyse whether a nexus exists. The sentencing objectives in child abuse cases however is based on a mixture of retribution and deterrence tempered by mandatory minimum sentence. Across the board it was seen. that the cases of child abuse either diminished or maintained the same number due to effective investigations, implementation of mandatory minimum sentences and less judicial discretion in sentencing. Therefore, the Kenyan experience can be remedied through introduction of mandatory minimums of penalties. This removes discretion of the judiciary and as such aligns the purpose of the laws. Strengthening of child abuse investigations by the Kenya Police Service. This goes to improvement of infrastructure and reduction of bureaucracy.

During the last decade, the international community has employed noteworthy efforts to protect women from the effects of armed conflicts, and to <b>ensure</b> the <b>prosecution</b> of violators of women’s rights in post-conflict situations. This included inter alia, the adoption of binding treaties calling for protection of women against sexual and gender based violence(GBV), and the creation of an international Criminal Court and International tribunals to prosecute persons for the most serious crimes of international concern, including sexual and gender violence. During the armed conflict that occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between 1996 and 2003, a significant number of GBV acts were committed against women. Reports and statistical data from humanitarian organisations working in the DRC indicated an increase of GBV acts against women after the official cessation of the conflict. Moreover, reports indicated the emergence of GBV acts against women in areas that did not witness such acts during the conflict. The research paper interrogates, from a criminal justice angle, the response given to GBV acts perpetrated against women in the post-conflict setting.

40|$|This Article {{traces the}} history of two federal {{immigration}} crimes that have long supplemented the civil immigration system and now make up {{nearly half of all}} federal prosecutions: illegal entry and illegal re-entry. Little has been previously written about the historical lineage of either crime, despite the supporting role each has played in enforcing the nation’s civil immigration laws, particularly along the U. S. -Mexico border. This Article takes a critical look at the enforcement of each crime—-from when they were initially conceived of as a way to deter illegal immigration, then as a way to target dangerous aliens, and most recently as a means to do both. These shifting strategies, however, have one thing in common: ineffectiveness. Enforcing the crimes has never meaningfully deterred illegal immigration, and the government’s poorly designed proxy to determine whether an alien is “dangerous” has <b>ensured</b> that <b>prosecutions</b> have not made the public safer. The most recent period is particularly troubling—-enforcement has led to approximately 72, 000 combined prosecutions a year, at the cost of well over a billion dollars a year, and at the expense of prosecuting more serious crimes. Despite these huge costs and the related human carnage, the criminalization of illegal entry and re-entry is invariably left out of the discussion of comprehensive immigration reform, which reflects the silent treatment these crimes have received in the immigration and criminal law literature more generally. By reviewing eight decades of ineffective policy, this Article makes the case for why there should be a fundamental re-thinking concerning {{the way in which the}} United States uses the criminal justice system to regulate immigration...|$|R
40|$|My goal in this {{research}} {{was to develop a}} checklist for examining a cheque for information {{that can be used to}} identify, individualise and trace the perpetrator of a crime. A further intent was to share and introduce a number of important concepts, namely forensic investigation, identification, individualisation, the Locard principle and crime scene. This research will explain that forensic investigation refers to the using of sophisticated investigation techniques to obtain sufficient information to prove the true facts in a court of law. Further, that identification is the collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which an object is definitively recognisable or known, while the individual characteristics establish the individuality of a specific object. To link an individual with a crime scene, many types of evidence may be used and to associate an individual with the performed illegal handling, many types of evidence may be used. These types of evidence are commonly referred to as ”transfer” evidence. This process is also referred to as the ”Locard principle”. Lastly, a crime scene is explained as a place where a crime has occurred. It is also explained to be a ”laboratory of information” and therefore, during a cheque fraud investigation, the cheque is in most cases the only link to information to trace, identify and individualise the perpetrator. Therefore, the cheque should be treated as a crime scene. If forensic investigators use their knowledge of these concepts together with the checklist, it should enhance their investigation skills and empower them to become better equipped for the challenges they face in identifying, individualising and tracing the perpetrators in order to <b>ensure</b> successful <b>prosecution</b> and conviction.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the main focus}} of the {{researcher}} was to analyse a cheque to identify crime. This study intends to give the forensic investigator a guideline to follow during the analysis of a cheque under investigation. Crimes that could be detected during the analysis of a cheque are fraud, forgery and uttering. Other aspects were also explained to ensure {{a better understanding of the}} study, namely: forensic investigation, forensic investigator, identification and crime scenes. Forensic investigation is a systematic search for the truth with the primary purpose of finding a positive solution to a crime. Forensic investigation is not a game of chance, or based on storybook types of coincidences. Therefore, forensic investigators cannot rely on coincidental success to come their way. It is true that luck sometimes plays a role in forensic investigations, but it is the thorough investigator who creates his/her own opportunities and arrives at the right place at the right time. In order for a forensic investigator to strive for excellence, he/she must have a good knowledge of his/her field of work. It is important for the forensic investigator to understand that identification plays an important role in forensic investigation. An additional benefit is derived when one can individualise something because it makes the identification much more valuable. All crime scenes should furthermore be managed in such a way that all physical evidence can be collected in order to <b>ensure</b> successful <b>prosecution</b> and conviction in a court of law. It is the belief of the researcher that because cheques are not acknowledged as crime scenes and therefore not properly handled or protected, many investigations fail in court and the accused are acquitted.
