40|$|This research, {{promoted}} by the Università della Svizzera italiana, Accademia di architettura di Mendrisio, through i. CUP (Institute for the Contemporary Urban Project) laid the ground for establishing an observatory of industrial buildings that would give special attention to their fall into disuse and – {{at the same time}} – explore the scenarios for appraising the scope for converting potentially disused buildings and land. The study of <b>disused</b> <b>industrial</b> buildings in Ticino revealed considerable scope for the reuse of potentially <b>disused</b> <b>industrial</b> buildings. The data on buildings put to industrial use show that the number of <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> in Ticino is 3, 681 and that they occupy 2, 743 land parcels. The surface area covered by these buildings amounts to 2, 503, 335 square metres, corresponding to 8. 7 % of the total area of land built on in the canton. Land parcels accommodating at least one building put to a mainly industrial use account for 14, 349, 282 square metres of land in Ticino, equal about to 6 % of the overall building area of Ticino Canton. Of the above land and building stock, 1, 120 buildings (casting off 30. 4 %) covering a total surface area of 804, 591 square metres (casting off 32. 1 %) (corresponding to the built surface of Bellinzona commune) qualify as potentially disused and the land parcels accommodating them number 813 (casting off 29. 6 %), 7, 058, 532 sq m (casting off 49. 1 %), equating to about half the surface area of Bellinzona commune. An approximate estimate of the volume of the buildings surveyed (the average height is 6 metres) yields a value of 5, 000, 000 cubic metres. <b>industrial</b> areas, <b>disused</b> buildings, diused land...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{irregular}} geometrical patterns of <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> and {{items of the}} process machinery installed in <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> cause redistribution of the acoustic energy and its essential acoustic properties, including the average free path length, the reverberation time, and the average sound absorption coefficient. Any failure {{to take account of}} the above influence causes errors in identification of the sound pressure intensity and in assessment of efficiency of design and acoustics-related actions aimed at noise reduction that incorporate sound-proof facing. The authors present the results of simulation of acoustic processes in the premises that have items of process machinery installed, and analyze their influence on the sound absorption intensity. The software developed {{on the basis of the}} beam tracing method is designated to assess the influence of patterns of arrangement of items of equipment onto acoustic parameters of premises. The software comprises independent modules designated for the simulation of acoustic processes in different premises that demonstrate different acoustic properties. The results of the research demonstrate that the software simulation of noise processes on the basis of the method of beam tracing is an effective tool that may be effectively applied in the analysis of noise patterns inside <b>industrial</b> <b>premises.</b> The software may be employed to identify integrated acoustic patterns inside <b>industrial</b> <b>premises</b> with account for the influence of dimensions of premises, characteristics of items of process machinery capable of disseminating sounds, etc. and other factors of signifi cance in terms of the distribution of reflected sound energy. Presently, advanced software is being developed on the basis of the proposed method of noise assessment in the premises that have irregular geometrical patterns...|$|R
