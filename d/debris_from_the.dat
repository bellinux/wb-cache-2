5|$|On October27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last {{reported}} {{its location}} {{to the south}} of Guanaja, while trying to escape the brunt of the storm. The United States Coast Guard searched until November4, when they observed the <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship. All 31 people on board were presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{sea urchins}} use their tube feet {{to pick up}} <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom and attach it to their upper surfaces. They use shells, rocks, algae and {{sometimes}} sea anemones.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 {{earthquake}} and tsunami {{has affected the}} island's ecosystem. At Iboih village, a large swath of mangrove was destroyed. <b>Debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> land was deposited on the nearby reefs {{as a result of}} the tsunami. In 2005, about 14,400mangrove seedlings were replanted to save the mangrove forest.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the arch. The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are still visible where they were found, at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm passed through Indonesia, local {{government}} and Red Cross officials distributed assistance to the storm victims, including food, medicine, clean water, and mattresses; additionally, the government sent about $400million (2003IDR, $50,0002003USD). The affected citizens resided in temporary shelters, including schools, police offices, and shelters built by local governments. Officials deployed machines to remove <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roads affected by the landslides.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interior of the nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring {{the view of the}} impact crater.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium {{was first}} {{identified}} in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California, Berkeley {{in collaboration with}} the Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952 at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, , which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or <b>debris,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. <b>Debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|E

5|$|On April29, 1963, {{less than}} half a year after Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters in order to protect those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits {{are much}} farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> breakup of such bodies {{after they were}} captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe, the ninth moon of Saturn, discovered {{at the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|When the RUC {{arrived at}} the site they found five dead bodies, a seriously injured Stephen Travers, body parts, the {{smouldering}} remains of the destroyed minibus, <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bomb blast, bullets, spent cartridges, and the band members' personal possessions, including clothing, shoes, and {{a photograph of the}} group, strewn across the area. They also discovered a stolen white Ford Escort registration number 4933 LZ, which had been left behind by the gunmen, along with two guns, ammunition, green UDR berets and a pair of glasses later traced to James McDowell, the gunman who had ordered the shootings.|$|E
50|$|After the Wetlands Reserve was constructed, tonnes {{of debris}} had flowed down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> River Taff and {{collected}} near the reserve, so in 2003 Cardiff Harbour Authority built a 450-metre floating boom to prevent <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> entering <b>the</b> reserve.|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Flight Lieutenants Ben Erwin Plumer and William Warren Hargrove {{received}} the DFC on 15 December 1944 for shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 6 October: F/O Dennis George Tongue {{was awarded the}} DFC on 29 December 1944, and a bar to his DFC on 2 March 1945. F/O Tongue {{was a member of}} the RAF, had been commissioned from sergeant and promoted to flying officer. On the night he won the bar to his DFC, on 25 November 1944, his pilot was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Forces. They destroyed three Junkers Ju 88s, their own Mosquito having been hit by <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second Ju 88, and during the fight that led to the downing of the third, Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.|$|E
