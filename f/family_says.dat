Macdonald but was only given $2,000. In the United States, his petition for $13,412 for his expenses was dismissed altogether; he later received $5,000 in 1905.|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the <b>family</b> <b>says</b> Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E

2500|$|On September 1, 2009, Livgren had {{a stroke}} early in the day. His {{condition}} was reported as [...] "serious, but stable." [...] By September 4, family members called his condition positive and said his progress in recovering was encouraging. Livgren underwent surgery and received two stents in his carotid arteries. The area of his brain in which the stroke-causing clot formed deals with language and other high-end skills. Livgren's <b>family</b> <b>says</b> his face {{did not have the}} [...] "sagging" [...] often found in stroke victims, he recognized family members, and would squeeze their hands in recognition. The family established the Kansas band Web site as the only authorized source for information on Livgren's recovery. Livgren has now recovered partially and has resumed work on his various musical projects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{designs for}} Pedro Linares' alebrijes {{have fallen into}} the public domain. However, according to Chapter Three of the 1996 Mexican federal copyright law, {{it is illegal to}} sell crafts made in Mexico without acknowledging the community and region they are from, or to alter the crafts in a way that could be interpreted as damaging to the culture’s reputation or image. The law applied to the commercialization of the crafts as well as to their public exhibition and the use of their images. However, this law is rarely enforced; most crafts sellers in Mexico rarely give the origin of their products are from. The name “alebrijes” is used {{for a wide variety of}} crafts even though the Linares family has sought to gain control over the name. The <b>family</b> <b>says</b> that pieces which are not made by them and do not come from Mexico City should state so. The Linares family continues to export their work to the most important galleries showing Mexican art worldwide. For example [...] "Beasts and Bones: The Cartonería of the Linares Family" [...] in Carlsbad, California featured about seventy alebrijes and was so popular that it was extended by several weeks.|$|E
2500|$|South Park (aired on Comedy Central, {{a sister}} network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) {{took aim at}} the {{hysteria}} in its eighth season premiere, [...] "Good Times with Weapons", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a [...] "wardrobe malfunction". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage – {{a reference to the}} American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity. During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was [...] "the biggest mistake [...] since [...] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl." [...] Family Guy also did an episode based around the [...] "wardrobe malfunction" [...] and the FCC's crackdown on [...] "indecent" [...] content, with one scene parodying the incident directly. The fourth season episode [...] "PTV" [...] involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the [...] "Side Boob Hour" [...] which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his <b>family</b> <b>says</b> and does).|$|E

60|$|I {{find myself}} still {{sitting in front}} of the last book by Mr. H. G. Wells, I say stunned with admiration, my <b>family</b> <b>says</b> sleepy with fatigue. I still feel vaguely all the things in Mr. Wells's book which I agree with; and I still feel vividly the one thing that I deny. I deny that biology can destroy the sense of truth, which alone can even desire biology. No truth which I find can deny that I am seeking the truth. My mind cannot find {{anything}} which denies my mind... But what is all this? This is no sort of talk for a genial essay.

I hope yours, my respected reader, are large; {{that there are many}} fine round sums of figures {{on each side of the}} page: liberal on the expenditure side, greater still on the receipt. I hope, sir, you will be [...] "a better man," [...] as they say, in '62 than in this moribund '61, whose career of life is just coming to its terminus. A better man in purse? in body? in soul's health? Amen, good sir, in all. Who is there so good in mind, body or estate, but bettering won't still be good for him? O unknown Fate, presiding over next year, if you will give me better health, a better appetite, a better digestion, a better income, a better temper in '62 than you have bestowed in '61, I think your servant will be the better for the changes. For instance, I should be the better for a new coat. This one, I acknowledge, is very old. The <b>family</b> <b>says</b> so. My good friend, who amongst us would not be the better if he would give up some old habits? Yes, yes. You agree with me. You take the allegory? Alas! at our time of life we don't like to give up those old habits, do we? It is ill to change. There is the good old loose, easy, slovenly bedgown, laziness, for example. What man of sense likes to fling it off and put on a tight guinde prim dress-coat that pinches him? There is the cozy wraprascal, self-indulgence--how easy it is! How warm! How it always seems to fit! You can walk out in it; you can go down to dinner in it. You can say of such what Tully says of his books: Pernoctat nobiscum, peregrinatur, rusticatur. It is a little slatternly--it is a good deal stained--it isn't becoming--it smells of cigar-smoke; but, allons donc! let the world call me idle and sloven. I love my ease better than my neighbor's opinion. I live to please myself; not you, Mr. Dandy, with your supercilious airs. I am a philosopher. Perhaps I live in my tub, and don't make any other use of it--. We won't pursue further this unsavory metaphor; but, with regard to some of your old habits let us say-- ...|$|E
