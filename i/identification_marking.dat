In June 1943 VIII Bomber Command introduced the use of a geometric symbol painted on either side of a bomber's vertical fin to denote a bombardment wing (later division) <b>identification</b> <b>marking.</b> These devices were white in color and 80 inches in diameter. A triangle denoted the B-17 1st Bombardment Wing (later 1st Air Division), a circle the B-24 2nd Bombardment Wing, and a square the B-17 4th Bombardment Wing (later 3rd Air Division). The B-26 medium bombers of the 3rd Bombardment Wing did not use this scheme.|$|E

30|$|In {{the above}} {{discussion}} regarding various <b>identification</b> <b>marks,</b> it is {{emphasized that the}} <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> from {{the characteristics of the}} volcanic products mostly reflect the depositional environmental information of the eruption products. Of all the <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> discussed here, only vesicles content of pyroclasts ejected from an explosive eruption {{is directly related to the}} eruption environment, which can be used as the direct evidence for identifying the eruption environment (Table 1, Table 2). Other <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> do not directly reflect the eruption environment but the depositional environment instead. The following conditions should be matched first if the aforementioned indirect marks are also used to identify the eruption environment: (1) eruption position (the crater) is flat and very close to depositional area; (2) depositional area is located in deep water in large-scale basins and meanwhile the volcanic materials do not belong to the reworked sediments of early eruptive products. Otherwise, it is difficult to ensure that the depositional environment can reflect or represent the eruption environment.|$|R

5000|$|Unique <b>Identification</b> <b>Marking,</b> UID marking, Item Unique Identification or IUID, {{is a part}} of the {{compliance}} process mandated by the United States Department of Defense. It is a permanent marking method used to give equipment a unique ID. Marking is essential for all equipment with an acquisition cost of over $5,000, equipment which is mission essential, controlled inventory, or serially-controlled. UID-marking is a set of data for assets that is globally unique and unambiguous. The technology used to mark an item is 2D Data Matrix ECC 200 Symbol. UID marking can be used to ensure data integrity and data quality throughout an item's lifecycle; it also supports multi-faceted business applications.|$|E

The Path Identification DDoS defense scheme has recently been proposed as a deterministic packet marking scheme that allows a DDoS victim to filter out attack packets on a per packet basis with high accuracy {{after only a few}} attack packets are received. This paper proposes the Stack Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking,</b> a new packet marking scheme based on path identification, and new filtering mechanisms. The Stack Path <b>Identification</b> <b>marking</b> scheme consists of two new marking methods that substantially improve Path identifier’s incremental deployment performance i. e., Stack-based marking and Write-ahead marking. The proposed scheme almost completely eliminates the effect of a few legacy routers on a path, and performs better than the original Path identification scheme in a sparse deployment of path identifier enabled routers. For the filtering mechanism, derive an optimal threshold strategy for filtering with the Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking.</b> The system develops the path identification IP filter, which can be used to detect IP spoofing attacks with just a single attack packet. Finally, evaluate the Stack path identification’s compatibility with IP Fragmentation, applicability in an IPv 6 environment, and several other important issues relating to potential deployment of Stack path identification.

The common <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> of these two eruption types consist of the underlying depositional environment (background factors), quenching structure and its products which were resulted from the encountering of hot volcanic materials into the cooler water.|$|R
