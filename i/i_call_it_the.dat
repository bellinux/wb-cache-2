500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

Gaud, who noted {{the spread of the}} new technologies: [...] "These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution.

5000|$|I {{wanted a}} name that would tell people what the shop was about.

2500|$|... "I {{was forced}} into making <b>it,</b> you understand? <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>The</b> Game because that's how the music {{business}} had become to me.

60|$|The great leading {{error of}} modern times is the mistaking erudition for education. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> leading error, for I believe that, with little difficulty, nearly every other might be shown to have root in it; and, most assuredly, the worst that are fallen into {{on the subject of}} art.|$|E

I made up nice little dances for them, tutu roles. They would be the snowflakes, and I would be the snowman. I was the boss because I organized the company and I was the tallest.

5000|$|Rudd was in Canada {{when the}} September 11 attacks happened. Rudd felt [...] "spun out" [...] {{watching}} the American media coverage, including graphic {{imagery of the}} destruction of the World Trade Center. Rudd wrote the song The 12th of September, which would feature on his first studio album To Let, about the day after the attacks. In 2006, discussing the song, Rudd said: [...] That's what the song's about, the world waiting. All of a sudden there was an attack and there was these people who were equally as toxic that were going to retaliate. No one could really do anything about <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> about <b>the</b> next day and that's why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> 12th of September.|$|R
40|$|The {{genesis of}} Feynman’s {{original}} approach to QED is reviewed. The main ideas {{of his original}} presentation at the Pocono Conference are discussed and compared with the ones involved in his action-at-distance formulation of classical electrodynamics. The role of the de Sitter group in Feynman’s visualization of space-time processes is pointed out. “I had used it to formulate quantum electrodynamics. I invented it to do that. It {{was in fact the}} mathematical formulation that I expressed at the Pocono Conference –that was this crazy language. Dates don’t mean anything. It was published in 1951, but it had all been invented by 1948. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> operator calculus. ” R. P. Feynman [1]...|$|R

It is a movement against unjust discrimination, no doubt, but it has another side to me, a poetic side, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> farmer is a free citizen of a great republic, it is true; but he is a Solitary free citizen. He lives alone too much. He meets his fellow-men too little. His dull life, his hard work, make it almost impossible to keep his better nature uppermost. The work of the grange is a social work."

60|$|Upon this {{supposed}} {{personality and}} superiority of Satan, or, as <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> sovereignty and government of one Devil {{above all the}} rest; I say, upon this notion are form'd all the systems of {{the dark side of}} futurity, that we can form in our minds: And so general is the opinion of it, that it will hardly bear to be oppos'd by any other argument, at least that will bear to be reason'd upon: All the notions of a parity of Devils, or making a common-wealth among the black Divan, seem to be enthusiastick and visionary, but with no consistency or certainty, and is so generally exploded, that we must not venture so much as to debate the point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear sir, {{you have}} a pretty little simple dinner to-day," [...] Toff began. [...] "Forgive me for praising myself, I am {{influenced}} by the natural pride of having cooked the dinner. For soup, you have Croute au pot; for meat, you have Tourne-dos a la sauce poivrade; for pudding, you have Pommes au beurre. All so nice--and you hardly eat anything, and your amiable conversation falls into a melancholy silence which fills me with regret. Is it you who {{are to blame for}} this? No, sir! it is the life you lead. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> life of a monk; <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> life of a hermit--I say boldly it is the life of all others which is most unsympathetic to a young man like you. Pardon the warmth of my expressions; I am eager to make my language the language of utmost delicacy. May I quote a little song? It is in an old, old, old French piece, long since forgotten, called 'Les Maris Garcons'. There are two lines in that song (I have often heard my good father sing them) which I will venture to apply to your case; 'Amour, delicatesse, et gaite; D'un bon Francais c'est la devise!' Sir, you have naturally delicatesse and gaite--but the last has, for some days, been under a cloud. What is wanted to remove that cloud? L'Amour! Love, as you say in English. Where is the charming woman, who is the only ornament wanting to this sweet cottage? Why is she still invisible? Remedy that unhappy oversight, sir. You are here in a suburban Paradise. I consult my long experience; and I implore you to invite Eve.--Ha! you smile; your lost gaiety returns, and you feel it as I do. Might I propose another glass of claret, and the reappearance on the table of the Tourne-dos a la poivrade?" ...|$|E

60|$|How {{much have}} you received, or may you yet receive, think you, of that teaching? <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> myth, or fact; but {{remember}} that, as a myth, it is a fact. This story has concentrated whatever good {{there is in}} the imagination or visionary powers in women, inspired by nature only. The traditions of witch and gypsy are partly its offshoots. You despise both, perhaps. But can you, though in utmost pride of your supreme modern wisdom, suppose that the character--say, even of so poor and far-fallen a sibyl as Meg Merrilies--is only the coinage of Scott's brain; or that, even being no more, it is valueless? Admit the figure of the Cumaean Sibyl, in like manner, to be the coinage only of Virgil's brain. As such, it, and the words it speaks, are yet facts in which we may find use, if we are reverent to them.|$|E

60|$|It was the {{beginning}} of June when I left this remote place. We were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels in all, which passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was natural also that I should take more servants with me than I had before; and the young lord passed for my steward; what great man I passed for myself I know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in our whole journey; <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> worst, because the way was very deep in some places, and very uneven in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear, as they never came {{on this side of the}} river Oby, or at least very seldom; but we found it otherwise.|$|E
