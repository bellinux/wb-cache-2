40|$|Airlines {{frequently}} use code-share agreements allowing {{each other}} to market seats on flights operated by partner airlines. Regulation may allow code-share agreements with antitrust immunity (cooperative price setting), or without antitrust immunity, or not at all. I compare relative welfare effects of these regulation regimes for complementary airline networks. A crucial point is that such agreements are used to identify and price discriminate <b>interline</b> <b>passengers.</b> I find that <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> always benefit from code-share agreements while non-interline passengers are worse off. Furthermore, I show that the second effect questions the overall usefulness of code-share agreements from a welfare perspective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} mergers across airline hub-and-spoke networks, on traffic levels, consumer surplus and the profit of competing airlines. Previous research has concentrated on the benefits such mergers provide for <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> and typically show that consumer welfare rises. This paper illustrates how tractable changes in the level and nature of competition can reverse the welfare implications even when <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> benefit. The model fits the proposed BA/AA alliance and provides some interesting insight into the European and US Competition Commission’s findings, and the likely consumer welfare implications of this proposed ‘virtual merger’...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} price competition between two international airline alliances, with consumers' preferences vertically differentiated {{by the number of}} stops. Alliances benefit the <b>interline</b> <b>passengers.</b> Alliances with antitrust immunity do not benefit <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> more than those without antitrust immunity, in contrast to the Cournot-type settings. While antitrust immunity leads to higher fares for non-stop travel between hubs of alliance partners, granting it might be necessary to induce consolidation between carriers. Formation of alliances with antitrust immunity is consistent with the proposed model, even though these are likely to decrease individual carriers' profit. © 2005 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
25|$|According to the Kirpal Report, 105 {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} flight at Mirabel Airport while 202 passengers who traveled on Flight 182 had boarded Flight 181 at Toronto Pearson Airport. The report stated that <b>interlining</b> <b>passengers</b> boarding Flight 181 in Toronto who became passengers on Flight 182 included 10 passengers connecting from Vancouver, 5 passengers from Winnipeg, 4 passengers from Edmonton, and 2 passengers from Saskatoon. It stated {{that all of}} these passengers had taken flights on Air Canada, and no <b>interlining</b> <b>passengers</b> boarded Flight 182 in Montreal. In the documentary Air India 182 Renée Sarojini Saklikar stated that her aunt and uncle had taken a CP Air flight from Vancouver to connect to AI182; the two were on AI182 while it was in Montreal. The flight crew and cabin crew of Flight 182 had boarded in Toronto and commanded the segment of Flight 181 from Toronto to Montreal.|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{coordination}} {{is considered}} both {{a reason for}} and a consequence of airline consolidation. The authors formally model this dimension of airline partnerships, with complementary alliance where stop-over delays affect passengers' utility. They compare partnership where carriers are only allowed to coordinate scheduling to the one, where airlines can jointly set prices and schedules. Coordination in fares and schedules yields lower fares and better scheduling coordination. Coordination in only the price results in lower consumer welfare than under no coordination. The authors suggest {{an example of a}} complementary airline alliance hurting <b>interline</b> <b>passengers.</b> © 2007 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R

50|$|Within Virgin-branded {{airlines}} V Australia offered codeshare {{services with}} Virgin Australia throughout its network in Oceania, and {{to and from}} New Zealand with Pacific Blue Airlines. V Australia also had an interline agreement with Virgin America to Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York City, Seattle and Washington DC. Virgin America and V Australia shared terminal facilities at Los Angeles International Airport's Terminal 3; inbound V Australia flights used {{to arrive at the}} Tom Bradley International Terminal, as of November 2011 inbound flights arrive at Terminal 5. All V Australia connections were through Los Angeles International Airport. U.S. <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> were transferred onto V Australia to a destination within Australia.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} showing {{the effect of}} airline cooperation on the interline fares paid by international passengers. The analysis focuses on two measures of cooperation, codesharing and antitrust immunity, and {{the results show that}} their partial effects are both negative. The presence of codesharing on an international interline itinerary reduces the fare by 8 %- 17 %, with the exact number depending on the sample used and the estimation method. Moreover, the presence of antitrust immunity reduces the fare by 13 %- 21 %. Codesharing and immunity are substitutes, however, in the sense that their combined effect is smaller than the sum of their partial effects. Taking account of this difference, which is captured by an interaction variable in the regressions, the combined effect ranges between 17 % and 30 %. These results provide strong evidence that airline cooperation in the fare-setting process generates substantial benefits for <b>interline</b> <b>passengers.</b> © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 25, 1985, Southwest Airlines {{acquired}} Muse Air, and Muse Air {{was allowed}} to continue to operate as a separate airline. In February 1986 its name was changed to [...] "TranStar Airlines." [...] Lamar Muse was removed from having any active role in management, and the company was restructured. McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and DC-9-50 jetliners continued to be operated and the airline's routes were modified to provide flights between California/Nevada and Florida via Texas and Louisiana, primarily via Houston Hobby Airport and New Orleans. [...] These flights were restricted from carrying mail, air freight, and any <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> traveling partly on other airlines. TranStar also introduced new nonstop flights such as Houston Hobby (HOU) - San Francisco (SFO), Las Vegas (LAS) - San Francisco (SFO), Los Angeles (LAX) - San Francisco (SFO), Houston Hobby (HOU) - Miami (MIA), New Orleans (MSY) - Los Angeles (LAX), New Orleans (MSY) - Las Vegas (LAS), New Orleans (MSY) - Miami (MIA) and New Orleans (MSY) - San Antonio (SAT). [...] Among other changes were a new corporate image, replacing Muse Air's beige aircraft livery and color scheme branding, with a dark blue tone, accentuated by concentric multi-hued pinstripes banding the fuselage. Attempts were made to integrate the TranStar pilots with Southwest Airlines pilots, but in {{a classic example of}} misapplied BATNA an integrated seniority list was rejected by the TranStar pilot's association. At its peak, TranStar employed some 900 people and served 14 cities, but by mid 1987 the company was still not making a profit and the airline was shut down.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{helicopter}} airlines to operate without a federal subsidy and it was also the first to operate with only turbine engine helicopters. Since helicopter landing sites were scarce at that time, the port of Oakland's board committee supported the service. Passenger flights started with two leased 10-passenger Sikorsky S-62 turbine helicopters. In late summer of 1961, the SFO Helicopter Airlines system timetable stated that 68 flights a day were operated, with the airline claiming that its helicopters made less noise than neighborhood trucks. In 1962, the U.S. Post Office Department granted San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines airmail contract number AM-103, allowing it to transport U.S. Mail until 1976. In 1965, the airline tried operating a 15-seat Westland-Bell SK-5 hovercraft between San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Oakland International Airport (OAK), and San Francisco. In 1969, it carried 320,000 passengers on more than 100 flights a day. According to the April 27, 1969 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable, each arriving and departing flight at SFO served not one but two gates: American Airlines gate 45 and TWA gate 53 with staggered arrival and departure times for each flight at each gate being reflected in the timetable. [...] In May 1968, after continuous growth, the company's schedule reached 14 weekday departures from the San Francisco Ferry Building, 11 from Marin, 13 from Berkeley, three from a parking garage in Oakland, and 9 from Lafayette. For <b>interline</b> <b>passengers</b> connecting at SFO and then heading east beyond Colorado, the ticket to SFO cost $4.75 from Marin or Lafayette and only $4.50 from Berkeley.|$|R
50|$|As a {{low cost}} carrier (LCC) Vietjet {{does not have}} any direct booking {{capabilities}} with the Global Distribution Service (GDS) companies, Amadeus CRS, Sabre, or Travelport. This lack of connectivity limits the ability of the airline to attract <b>interline</b> connecting <b>passengers</b> for inbound and outbound flights. The problem {{is due in part to}} the lack of the airline joining Iata's Vietnam BSB which regulates the IATA accredited airlines banking settlement operations in the country. To get around the issue Vietjet has utilised an interline ticketing partner, Hahn Air (HR), which allows for ticketing in more than 194 jurisdictions, but excludes ticketing in Vietnam. In August 2016 Hahn Air announced that they could provide ticketing for domestic Vietnam flights on Vietjet via the Amadeus platform, effectively locking out the other GDS systems for domestic ticketing in Vietnam.|$|R
5000|$|British Caledonian, British Airways Helicopters and the British Airports Authority (the {{operator}} of both airports) began discussing a new service in mid-1977. Their rationale {{was that a}} quick, high-frequency shuttle would [...] "effectively link the two airports' flight networks" [...] and allow Gatwick and Heathrow [...] "to operate in tandem". [...] In 1978, they formed a joint venture company called London Airways to operate a new shuttle service using a Sikorsky S-61N helicopter. [...] This was owned by BAA, who [...] "saw link as another sweetener for airlines banished to Gatwick". (Moving to Gatwick was generally unpopular with Heathrow-based airlines because it was less convenient for passengers making connections.) [...] British Airways Helicopters (a subsidiary of British Caledonian's larger rival British Airways) could not provide one because all of its aircraft were already in use on services to North Sea oil rigs and the Isles of Scilly. [...] British Caledonian itself was responsible for marketing, ground crew and the single member of cabin crew. [...] Initially, British Airways Helicopters provided the pilots and engineering services; but they later withdrew from the joint venture and were replaced by British Caledonian Helicopters, who provided the same things. [...] The helicopter could accommodate up to 28 passengers, and the company set a target of 64,000 passengers per year. It claimed a potential annual benefit of £10 million to the British economy, {{on the assumption that}} each <b>interlining</b> <b>passenger</b> would be transferring to another British carrier and would be generating £150 profit. [...] These arguments—along with claims that international interlining traffic would be won from rival European airports such as Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol; that the British government's transport and economic policies treated Gatwick and Heathrow as a single entity; and the flight planners' demonstration that the route chosen for Airlink would have [...] "the least possible impact" [...] on residential areas below the flightpath—helped to convince the Civil Aviation Authority to allow the service to start.|$|R
