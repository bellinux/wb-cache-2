40|$|The key {{findings}} of the small-scale Flygt mixer tests are provided in this section. Some of these findings may not apply in larger tanks, so these data must be applied carefully when making predictions for large tanks. Flygt mixer testing in larger tanks at PNNL and in a full-scale tank at the SRS {{will be used to}} determine the applicability of these findings. The principal objectives of the small-scale Flygt mixer tests were to measure the critical fluid velocities required for sludge mobilization and particle suspension, to evaluate the applicability of the Gladki (1997) method for predicting required mixer thrust, and to provide small-scale test results for comparison with larger-scale tests to observe the effects of scale-up. The tank profile and mixer orientation (i. e., stationary, <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixers)</b> were in the same configuration as the prototype system, however, available resources did not allow geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similitude to be achieved. The results of these tests will be used in conjunction with the results from similar tests using larger tanks and mixers (tank diameters of 1. 8 and 5. 7 m [Powell et al. 1999]) to evaluate the effects of scaling and to aid in developing a methodology for predicting performance at full scale...|$|R
50|$|In powder two {{different}} dimensions in the mixing {{process can be}} determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing. In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. Possible threat during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation. In the convective mixing range, Hosokawa has several processes available from silo <b>mixers</b> to <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixers</b> and conical mixers.When materials are cohesive, which {{is the case with}} e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Heterogeneous {{granular}} mixtures tend {{to segregate}} when tumbled in a partially lled, horizontal rotating drum. The dynamical evolution of segregation can, under certain conditions, be oscillatory. Continuum, order parameter-style models {{of this process}} posit two coupled elds which oscillate out of phase with one another. Here we examine three candidate elds, the surface concentration, the local streaming angle and the projected concentration of the subsurface core. We nd that all these quantities are in phase with one another, in contradiction to a recent order parameter model. One of the fascinating idiosyncrasies of dry granular materials is their tendency to seg-regate by size under various ow conditions [1, 2]. Segregation is ubiquitous in natural and industrial processes, and can produce a startling degree of spontaneous order [3, 4]. Probably the best controlled example is segregation along the axis of a partially lled, <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixer</b> " [514]. After many rotations, an initially mixed binary distribution sorts itself into al-most periodic bands arranged along the axis of the cylinder. The process can display complex, oscillatory wave dynamics during the transient before segregation saturates [9, 10, 13].

40|$|Background and Aim: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is a {{viral disease}} {{that caused the}} largest animal disease outbreak in the history of US agriculture. There are several disposal methods of AI infected poultry carcasses available in the US, which include on-site burial, landfill, incineration, rendering, and composting. Of these methods, composting is the most environmentally friendly and poses a low risk for biosecurity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed a comprehensive plan for composting AI infected carcasses. The current protocols have the potential for areas of anaerobic pockets within the windrow due to inadequate mixing and the large carcass size of whole birds. This could lead to ineffective virus neutralization or prolonged composting times and higher resource costs. The purpose of this project was to determine if using a <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixer</b> (HM) wagon to mix composting ingredients or a vertical mixer (VM) wagon to mix and cut up the compositing ingredients is an economical and timely means to accelerate the tissue break-down and obtain optimal temperatures for poultry carcass composting during an AI outbreak. Materials and Methods: A replicated trial with three treatments, HM, conventional layering (CL) and VM, and three replications was initiated at the Compost Research and Education Center part of the University of Maine Forest and Agricultural Experimental Station called High Moor Farm. Daily temperatures and screened core sample weights (screen weights) on day 0, 16, and 30 were recorded for each of the compost piles. The time to build each replication was recorded and used to help calculate the cost of each method. Data on equipment, carbon material and labor costs were collected from private contractors from the 2014 to 2016 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) outbreak and used to compare costs between methods. Results: All treatment methods reached USDA protocol temperatures to neutralize the HPAI virus. Screen weights for both the VM and HM treatments were lower than the CL treatment. Screen weights decreased significantly from day 0 to day 16 for the VM and HM treatments with no significant change from day 16 to day 30. When comparing costs, the mixer wagon methods were the more cost effective than the CL method when using high volume equipment. Conclusion: The data from this study support the use of a mixer wagon to reduce particle size and mix ingredients for more timely and effective composting of poultry carcasses...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Medicina VeterináriaThe feed {{management}} {{is very important}} in animal nutrition, specifically in farm animals. The diet supplements usually associated with high milk yield of cows is often used also by the ease of their management. This work studied the homogeneity of the TMR designed for Holstein dairy cows using an <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixer</b> wagon, by chemical composition (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) and particle size (sieve with 19, 8, 1 mm and bottom) to ensure that meets their nutritional needs. Also the nutritional parameters (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) were studied for the feed constituents in the diet: corn silage, alfalfa hay, tomato pomace and compound feed. For this study feed from 3 pens which contain the same diet consisting for 226 cows was analyzed. Samples of the diet were taken in for 4 days (not consecutive) in {{the beginning and end of}} each pen, while in the pen 2 and 3 were also sampled in the middle, after distribution of the morning diet. On the chemical composition of the diet, there are only significant variations in levels of DM and ADL, taking into account the day of trial, without these differences result in bad diets formulated or processed. These changes may be due to the quantity of tomato incorporated in the diet (high moisture). Compared to the previously formulated diet, the results indicate that the DM and CP are slightly lower; the values proposed by NRC (2001) for NDF are below the values obtained, while the percentage of ADF is in agreement with the expected. On the study of the ingredients of the diet, there are specific nutritional differences compared with reference values, but in a general rule, feeds in the diet for the parameters under study are within the specified limits. The results of the particle size of the diet showed significant differences in all size classes for the days of testing, including also the particles between 1 to 8 mm in view of the pens of the test. In D 1, the percentage of particles between 1 to 8 mm is higher than expected, with other classes within the size limits. The reduction of particles retained in sieve of 8 mm, and an increase in the sieve of 1 mm in D 2, can be explain by the mixing time practiced. Overall, the proportion of particles 8 - 19 mm were under and particles 1 - 8 mm were above the recommended values. In the last day of testing, the higher processing time of the forage may have led to reduction of particles with size > 19 mm, leading to only the particles < 1 mm were in appropriate proportions. The differences occurred between pens were small and could be a consequence of the distance between pens and the path irregular used by SRMDR. On average the size fractions ranging from 1 to 8 mm to 19 mm and 8 are not inagreement with the expected. The particles retained in sieve of 1 mm are at higher percentage, whereas fractions retained in the sieve with 8 mm are lower.

40|$|High shear wet {{granulation}} is a particle design process used {{to increase the}} size of a primary powder material through the addition of liquid binder. This thesis focuses on the multi-scale nature of high-shear granulation in order to understand behavior changes due to coupled consolidation and coalescence as well as operational changes that occur during the scale up of <b>horizontal</b> ploughshare <b>mixer</b> granulators. The methodology relied on a micro-scale model for coalescence, a meso-scale model to describe flow within the granulator and a macro-scale population balance to describe the whole system. ^ A physically based coalescence model was adapted to the 3 D population balance model framework {{as a function of the}} granule internal property coordinates: solid volume, liquid volume, and gas volume. An empirical correlation was used to describe granule mechanical properties based on measured peak flow stress as a function of granule composition and strain rate. In this case study a well characterized but complex industrial formulation was used. The model predicts that rebound collision will occur early in the granulation and cause densification. As these granules consolidate and become stronger there is some critical composition at which the internal pore space is saturated with liquid and a film comes to the surface. This micro-scale model is able to predict induction time based on understanding of consolidation. The model is validated by semi-quantitative comparison with experimental studies in a 50 L horizontal axis high shear granulator. Measurements of the size, porosity and morphology are used to verify rate process mechanisms over the course of the {{wet granulation}} process. The class of growth behavior and the length of the induction time are correctly predicted by the micro-scale model. ^ Scale up experiments were conducted to validate and test the predictions of the compartment model approach. Traditional scaling rules of constant impeller Froude number and constant impeller tip speed were shown to be ineffective at producing similar granule size distributions or porosities across granulator volumes of 10 L, 20 L and 50 L. Scale of the granulator had a large effect on product attributes and overall granulation behavior. At the 10 L scale the extent of breakage was limited and product size distributions remained broad. At the 20 L scale the distributions narrowed slightly compared to the 10 L and the rate of consolidation increased. The 50 L product properties had a narrow, desirable size distribution. The breakage and consolidation at the 50 L scale broke the granular clumps and consolidation rate was again higher that at the 20 L. The 50 L granulator’s behavior transitioned to granule growth showing that traditional scaling rules may not even predict overall granulation behavior. Because this change in behavior was due to the high extent of consolidation, a new scaling rule for the consolidation rate was developed for <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixers</b> across these scales. This is the first time a scaling rule has been determined across granulator scales with the ability to predict dramatic changes due to complex consolidation coupled coalescence. ^ A two compartment population balance model was developed to physically represent the flow heterogeneity and rate process segregation that occurs in a <b>horizontal</b> high-shear <b>mixer</b> granulator. It was composed of two zones, a circulation zone that represents the bulk of the mixer, and a breakage zone representing the high-speed chopper knives that are used to break up clumps and large granules. Flow between the two zones was determined by a heuristic and rules for model scale up were developed. The model includes expressions for consolidation coupled coalescence, and consolidation of granules in the circulation zone, and breakage is modeled in the breakage zone. This two compartment 2 D population balance model predicted scale up distributions well from the 10 L to 20 L and 50 L granulator experiments. ^ The compartmental population balance model is a useful tool that can be applied to different scales and types of granulators by configuring the appropriate meso-scale compartmental arrangement, and determining the which rate processes belong in each compartment. ...|$|R
40|$|Mixtures of {{granular}} media often exhibit {{size segregation}} along {{the axis of}} a partially-filled, horizontal, rotating cylinder.

40|$|International audienceThe {{stirring}} of powders {{of different}} flow behavior, namely one free-flowing (semolina) and one cohesive (lactose) is investigated in a four-blade <b>horizontal</b> convective <b>mixer.</b> The kinetics of homogenization are investigated for each powder separately, thanks to tracer experiments performed with colored semolina and talc, respectively tracers {{of the free}} flowing and of the cohesive powder. Different stirring times and rotational speeds of the impeller are studied. Three flow mechanisms are identified: convection, avalanching and diffusion. Convection conveys important amounts of powder near the blades, while the avalanching mechanism takes place on the powder bed surface. Diffusion, which is the slowest mechanism, allows powder transport to the zones of the blender in which blades do not pass through. The final tracer dispersion in the blender's volume is better for the free-flowing powder than for the cohesive powder, and is enhanced by an increase of the rotational speed. A simple Markov chain model based on the identified mechanisms is developed {{as a basis for}} discussion of the results. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Powder mixing {{is common}} in many {{industrial}} processes, yet traditional methods of investigation provide only very limited information {{of the influence of}} agitator geometry and important operational parameters on flow patterns. Here powder mixing is investigated in <b>horizontal</b> <b>mixers</b> using Positron Emission Particle Tracking, a recently developed non- invasive method of investigating solid or liquid systems. It is thus possible to investigate powder mixing far more thoroughly than hitherto. In particular it allows single particle motion to be followed at speeds up to 2 m/s in traditionally opaque equipment of diameter up to 400 mm. Powder flow patterns were characterised here using velocity fields as well as axial and radial mixing coefficients. The experiments were conducted in mixers of diameter 270 mm and of length 650 mm, the level of fill being varied between 20 and 70 % and the agitator speed between 20 and 45 rpm. Studies on a single long flat blade located on radial arms fixed to a rotor shaft revealed, at low fills, the presence in the cross-sectional plane of a circulation zone directly beneath the rotating shaft where little agitation occurred. This zone decreased in size and moved towards the agitator shaft with increase of fill. Distributions of velocity showed that powder movement was controlled by the number of blade passes. In a mixer having six long flat blades located on radial arms fixed to a rotor shaft, a circulation zone similar to that observed with the single blade agitator appeared beneath the agitator shaft. Axial flow patterns showed two loops of circulation inside each compartment defined by the supports of the rotating blades. Another type of agitator had series of short paddles. The material was more evenly distributed in the cross-sectional plane. The short blades also promoted axial displacement. Continuous experiments with the agitator having six long flat blades showed that behaviour in the cross-sectional plane was similar to that in batch experiments. Although two loops of circulation in each compartment remained, axial motion was dominated by the convective flow. The work opens the prospect of obtaining a detailed understanding of powder mixing and also of establishing links between powder flow patterns and a wide range of operations such as heat transfer, chemical reaction or agglomeration processes.

40|$|Introduction: High {{perinatal}} calf mortality {{associated with}} gestational vitamin A deficiency {{has been reported}} during extended dry seasons in the Mitchell grass rangelands (Hill et al. 2009). Adding vitamin A to supplements may aid prevention however it is inherently sensitive to degradation. Stability depends upon the manufacturing conditions (heat, moisture and pH), oxidising potential of ingredients and storage conditions (Shurson et al. 2011). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the stability of Vitamin A when included in dry season supplements manufactured using different methods. Methods: Three commercially available dry season supplements were manufactured using contrasting manufacturing methodologies; loose lick (LL), molten blocks (MB) and cold pour blocks (CB). All supplements were blended in a <b>horizontal</b> ribbon <b>mixer.</b> The LL supplements were decanted directly into 25 kg bags. The MB mixture was transferred to a heat jacketed mixing vessel, and then poured into cardboard cartons at 90 °C prior to hardening. Manufacturing of CB used a patented manufacturing method (IP No. 725349) under ambient temperature. The major ingredients in LL and MB were salt (275 - 300 g/kg as fed) and urea (250 - 300 g/kg). Composition of CB included 200 g/kg molasses, 150 g/kg urea and 100 g/kg salt. Rovimix® A 1000 (DSM) was included in each supplement to deliver 40 000 iu vitamin A/day. Expected concentrations were 240, 335, 270 iu Vitamin A/g for LL, MB and CB respectively. Samples were collected at day 0, 90 and 180 to determine Vitamin A status. Results and Discussion: Vitamin A degradation was both immediate and extensive for LL and MB relative to target concentrations (see Table 1). The levels decreased between manufacturing and day 90 for LL and MB (P< 0. 05), approaching the limit of detection by 180 days. Vitamin A concentrations of CB remained stable for the duration of the trial. The use of a CB manufacturing process is likely to have greater efficacy than either LL or MB when attempting to deliver vitamin A via dry season supplements...|$|R

A salt particle size × sample preparation × mixing time interaction (P< 0. 04) was observed. As salt particle size decreased and mixing time increased, there was a decrease in CV. Grinding samples before analysis decreased CV, compared with that of the unground samples, but to a greater extent with coarse salt than with fine salt. The batch mixed with 440 -micron salt and the batch mixed with 730 -micron salt (ground) reached a CV of less than 10 %, indicating a uniform mixture. No other treatments reached a CV of 10 % or less. When the mixer was filled to the rated capacity we were unable to achieve an acceptable CV for mixer efficiency; therefore, it is important to test mixers at various fill levels. Our study also showed {{that it is important to}} use a fine mixing salt when testing mixers for mixer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Swine research, 2005 {{is known}} as Swine day, 2005 Although the {{importance}} of thoroughly mixing diets is often emphasized, little data is available to quantify the impact of inadequate mixing on pig growth performance. Therefore, a 28 -d trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of mixing time on growth performance of nursery pigs. A total of 180 weanling pigs (13. 9 ± 1. 8 lb BW, 21 ± 3 d of age) were used, with 6 pigs per pen and 6 pens per treatment. Experimental treatments consisted of mixing a diet for 0, 30, 60, 120 or 330 s in a <b>horizontal</b> ribbon <b>mixer.</b> Diets were fed in two phases (d 0 to 14 and 14 to 28), with diets in both phases containing relatively large amounts of lowinclusion ingredients such as synthetic amino acids, zinc oxide, and phytase. Diets in Phase 1 also contained 3. 75 % fish meal and 15 % dried whey. Eight samples were collected from the mixer {{at the completion of}} the mixing time for each batch of feed to determine a coefficient of variation (CV). Each bag (50. 0 lb) was labeled (first to last) and sampled to determine the degree of mixing that occurred as feed was conveyed from the mixer to the bagger. Each pen of pigs was then assigned a bag of feed. Bags were distributed in the order bagged (1, 2, 3, etc.). As feed was needed, the next chronological bag of feed was then added. Mixer CV values were 178, 38, 26, 21, and 5 % for Phase 1 and 172, 79, 60, 48, and 26 % for Phase 2 as mixing time increased. Bag CV values were 26, 20, 16, 11, and 7 % for Phase 1 and 56, 45, 40, 33, and 12 % for Phase 2 as mixing time increased, indicating the degree of mixing that takes place as feed is conveyed from the mixer to the bagger. Growth performance was improved as mixing time increased (linear, P< 0. 01) in both phases. From d 0 to 28, increasing mix time increased (linear, P< 0. 01) ADG (0. 73, 0. 89, 0. 90, 0. 94, and 1. 02 for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 330 s, respectively). Increasing mixing time also improved F/G (linear, P< 0. 01; quadratic, P< 0. 07; 1. 55, 1. 40, 1. 32, 1. 33, 1. 30 for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 330 s, respectively). With greater use of lowinclusion ingredients such as synthetic amino acids in swine diets, these data demonstrate that inadequate mixing reduces nursery pig performance...|$|R
