50|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} cellular manufacturing, {{a number of}} steps must be performed. First, the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity (in design or manufacturing requirements) into families. Then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed; typically {{in the form of}} production flow analysis (PFA) for manufacturing families, or in the examination of design/product data for design families. This analysis can be time consuming and costly, but is important because a cell needs to be created for each <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{transfer}} {{line is a}} manufacturing system which consists of a predetermined sequence of machines connected by an automated material handling system and designed for working on a very small <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> Parts can be moved singularly because there’s no need for batching when carrying parts between process stations (as opposed to a job shop for example). The line can synchronous, meaning that all parts advance with the same speed, or asynchronous, meaning buffers exist between stations where parts wait to be processed. Not all {{transfer line}}s must geometrically be straight lines, for example circular solutions have been developed which make use rotary tables, however using buffers becomes almost impossible.A crucial problem for this production system is that of line balancing: a trade-off between increasing productivity and minimizing cost conserving total processing time.|$|E

An MRMT is capable of using a minimal number of modules through reconfiguration to perform the required machining tasks for a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts.</b> The proposed method consists of three steps: module identification, module determination, and layout synthesis. In the first step, the module components are collected from a family of general-purpose machines to establish a module library. In the second step, for a given <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> to be machined, a set of needed modules are selected from the module library to construct a desired reconfigurable machine tool. In the third step, a final machine layout is decided though evaluation by considering a number of performance indices.

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} of custom-made parts {{requires the}} development of strategies integrating design and manufacturing. The need for custom-made parts is increasing constantly due to its application in different industrial sectors: medical prosthesis, car parts, aircraft parts, etc. Under such context, this paper describes {{a part of the}} MISTRAL (Methods of InverSe engineering To develop RApid prototyping tooLs) project. Taking a file with clouds of points as main input, the aim was to generate CAD models and machining process plans for custom-made parts. The parts are different for every aircraft produced, since they have to fit in with large components, whose real geometry is subject to variable deformation states in the assembly process.

40|$|AbstractAdditive Manufacturing (AM) {{capabilities}} are evolving {{to overcome the}} mere manufacturing of prototypes. There are several challenges that AM processes must face {{in order to achieve}} reliable industrial-level applications. Thereby, improving dimensional and geometrical quality of AM parts has turned to be a key issue. Research efforts should be conducted in order to improve part quality, with the purpose of achieving industrial-degree tolerances. This objective becomes more relevant when parts have been designed to provide fitting, like those involving Features of Size (FoS). Present work deals with the analysis of factors influencing the quality of cylindrical features, on parts that have been manufactured using the PolyJet process. The purpose is to establish the relative influence of three main characteristics (size, location and orientation of the part within the manufacturing tray) upon dimensional and geometrical quality of cylindrical features belonging to a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of industry, transport, communications and technology results in tougher competition, i. e. {{the process of}} globalization takes place. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are greatly affected by this process, are expected to accept or to refuse the received offer {{in a very short}} period of time. Consequently, it is impossible for a small enterprise to create a technological process in order to calculate production times. The idea of the authors of this paper is to develop a system of part classification by means of group technologies. The classifier is used to classify parts into similar groups. So, if we have a new part, we can find a similar part and adopt its technological process to the new part. In the next step, an application to enable the production time estimation, and consequently the production cost estimation for each <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> will be developed...|$|E

40|$|When {{designing}} a Cellular Manufacturing System an essential {{step is to}} solve the cell formation problem: determining which machines and parts belong to each cell. The main purpose is to obtain autonomous cells capable of completely processing the respective <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> and thus eliminate, or at least reduce, intercellular flow. Additionally, if {{there is more than}} one machine of each type (i. e. if a certain operation can be performed in different machines) the assignment of operations to specific machines becomes part of the cell formation problem. In this paper an algorithm for the cell formation problem with multiple identical machines, which minimises the intercellular flow, is presented. The algorithm uses the information provided by an inter-operation flow matrix so the real flow, associated with each solution, can be adequately determined. Furthermore, due to the combinatorial nature of this problem, the procedure is based on genetic algorithms in order to improve the exploration of the solution space...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Reference List Cellular {{manufacturing}} {{has received}} {{a significant amount of}} attention in recent years by demonstrating great potential for productivity improvements in batch manufacturing. Often batch facilities produce items from a population of thousands of active part types using hundreds of machines organized in functional layouts. The cell design problem is to reconfigure the existing machines into smaller groups (or cells) of dissimilar machines with each cell dedicated to a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> where, ideally all parts in a given family are produced in a single cell. However, the typical case is that dedicated cells and families cannot be created to accommodate the whole population of parts and all machines, and, often a sizable "remnant" cell is left to serve those parts that do not fit into any families. The cell design process can be lengthy, requiring substantial effort to evaluate candidate cells according to a diversity of operational and economical p...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{reconfigurability}} {{of assembly}} systems, which enables {{a family of}} products to be produced on a single production line, is becoming of paramount importance in addressing increasing diversification of the market. One of the key issues in reconfigurable assembly systems is to identify the fixture workspace for a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> based on the individual configuration of the fixture-locating layout for each part. Aimed at the problems existing in the current research in this area, this paper presents an approach that allocates the best superposition of locating layouts for multiple parts to be assembled on a single reconfigurable fixture. The presented methodology is based on (1) analytical Procrustes analysis, to rapidly eliminate unlikely sets of solutions, and then (2) pairwise optimization of fixture configurations for a given part family. The proposed method is able to provide more accurate solutions for various Engineering Requirement Functions (ERFs) used in industrial practice with much less computational complexity than the existing method presented in the literature. Comprehensive case studies illustrate the proposed methodology {{as well as its}} advantages over the existing method...|$|E
