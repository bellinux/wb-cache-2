50|$|A {{fracture}} is any separation in a geologic formation, {{such as a}} joint or a {{fault that}} divides the rock into two or more pieces. A fracture will sometimes form a deep fissure or crevice in the rock. Fractures are commonly caused by stress exceeding the rock strength, causing the rock to lose cohesion along its weakest plane. Fractures can provide permeability for fluid movement, such as water or hydrocarbons. Highly fractured rocks can make good aquifers or hydrocarbon reservoirs, since they may possess both significant permeability and <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity.</b>|$|E

It has been difficult for some shareholders to reconcile the apparent low <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> figures suggested in the audits {{with the fact that}} the drilling on Shaikan has been notoriously difficult because of huge losses of drilling mud which have probably been lost into the fracture network. This is also in apparent contrast to reports from over 50 yrs earlier which indicated that the huge Kirkuk oil field in Kurdistan also has significant fracturing in its reservoirs and other apparent similarities between Kirkuk and Shaikan (Daniel, E.

Over the years, increases in computational and metallurgical resources have allowed the modeler to improve accuracy and increase the complexity of numerical predictors. An accurate prediction of micro-porosity, not observable using conventional radiographic techniques, and an engineering understanding of the effect on mechanical properties would give a designer confidence in using a more efficient casting design and a lower safety factor. This will give castings an additional design advantage. The goal of this project is to provide current and future modelers/designers with a tensile and Charpy property dataset for validation of micro-porosity predictors. The response of ultimate strength, elongation, and reduction in area to micro-porosity was very similar in all four alloys. Ultimate strength was largely unaffected by tensile <b>fracture</b> surface <b>porosity</b> until values of about 25 % were reached and decreased linearly with increasing values. Elongation and reduction in area decreased sharply after less than 5 % <b>fracture</b> surface <b>porosity.</b> Niyama values of about 0. 7 were produced sound material and acceptable tensile properties.

It is known that fracture characteristics are scale dependent; as such, the minimum sample size should be deduced in order to scale to reservoir dimensions. The main factor affecting mechanical and hydrological characteristics of natural fractures is aperture distribution, which {{is a function of}} scale and confining pressure, rather than roughness of one fracture surface. Scale and pressure dependencies of artificial and natural fractures were investigated in this study using an X-Ray CT Scanner. Fractal dimension, D, and amplitude parameter, A, of fracture aperture approaches a constant value with increased sampling area, similar to the behavior of fracture roughness. In addition, both parameters differ under different confining pressures for a reference sampling area. Mechanical properties of fracture-fracture deformation behavior and fracture normal stiffness were obtained from CT scan data as well.

First, shale <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> interpretation by using dual-porosity medium model is the effective method to evaluate quantitatively the <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> of shale reservoirs, and the development of quantitative characterization techniques of marine shale reservoir spaces. Second, the matrix pore volume of the principal pay zones in this area and its constitution regions are stably distributed with matrix porosity generally in the range of 4. 6 %– 5. 4 %.

Predicting the long term behaviour of cement is approached by reactive transport modelling, where some of the boundary conditions can be defined through studying natural cement analogues (e. g. at the Maqarin natural analogue site). At Maqarin, pyrometamorphism of clay biomicrites and siliceous chalks, caused by the in-situ combustion of organic matter, produced various clinker minerals. The interaction of infiltrating groundwater with these clinker phases resulted in a portlandite-buffered hyperalkaline leachate plume, which migrated into the adjacent biomicrite host rock, resulting in the precipitation of hydrated cement minerals. In this study, rock samples with different degrees of interaction with the hyperalkaline plume were investigated by various methods (mostly SEM-EDS). The observations have identified a paragenetic sequence of hydrous cement minerals, and reveal how the <b>fractures</b> and <b>porosity</b> in the biomicrite have become sequentially filled. In the alkaline disturbed zone, C-A-S-H (an unstoichiometric gel of Ca, Al, Si and OH) is observed to fill the pores of the biomicrite wallrock, as a consequence of reaction with a high pH Ca-rich fluid circulating in <b>fractures.</b> <b>Porosity</b> profiles indicate that in some cases the pores of the rock adjacent to the fractures became tightly sealed, whereas in the veins some porosity is preserved. Later pulses of sulphate-rich groundwater precipitated ettringite and occasionally thaumasite in the veins, whereas downstream in the lower pH distal regions of the hyperalkaline plume, zeolite was precipitated. Comparing our observations with the reactive transport modelling results reveals two major discrepancies: firstly, the models predict that ettringite is precipitated before C-A-S-H, whereas the C-A-S-H is observed as the earlier phase in Maqarin; and, secondly, the models predict that ettringite acts as the principal pore-filling phase in contrast to the C-A-S-H observed in the natural system. These discrepancies are related to the fact that our data were not available at the time the modelling studies were performed.

Well testing in NFR provides two characteristic parameters, storativity ratio and interporosity flow coefficient.

The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of estimating <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> and fracture spacing from single well test analysis and to evaluate the use of these two parameters in dual porosity simulation models.

The study area is the largely under explored Karoo‐aged, fault bounded Waterberg basin Located in the Limpopo Province of South Africa.

Analysis of <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> required coal cementation indices and fracture width as an input parameter.

The theoretical formulas are a modification from both Darcy’s equation and Archie’s equations. The coal seams were encountered at depths ranging from 198 m to 385 m in the wells and were marked by low density and very high resistivity. From the estimated results the coal reservoirs are characterised by high cementation indices ranging from 0. 82 to 2. 42, very low <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> and low fracture permeability. Estimated results show that coal reservoir <b>fracture</b> <b>porosity</b> ranged from 0. 0002 % to 0. 33 % for both BS 1 and Ecca seams.

Results when compared with those of injection falloff test shows that the estimated permeability is slightly lower as expected since the model did not account for coal anisopropy.

Fragments of coral, coralline red algae, and large foraminifera are the dominant bioclasts in most of the observed samples, whereas echinoids and bivalves are less abundant; they are set in a recrystallized micrite matrix. Planktonic foraminifera are abundant only in few samples. Fragments of plagioclase, igneous volcanic rocks, pyroclastic rocks (tuff), and much less abundant quartz are commonly present in all the studied samples. A generalized diagenesis includes early marine cementation by fibrous aragonite, compaction, aragonite dissolution and/or neomorphism, precipitation of equant-grained calcite cement in a phreatic environment, dissolution to form moldic porosities, dolomitization, the formation of stylolites and fractures, and precipitation of late ferroan calcite during burial. Multiple carbonate cements occur as pore-filling phases, with ferroan calcite cementation taking place during later-stage burial. Secondary porosities were formed during different stages in diagenetic processes, such as dissolution, dolomitization, and stylolite and fracture formations. Although precipitation of nonferroan and ferroan calcite cement occluded porosities, porosity enhancement during early selective dolomitization might still be significant. Current observations also revealed the presence of intraparticle, micro-vuggy, and <b>fracture</b> <b>porosities</b> in different samples...|$|R
