5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a noose, a goad, a sugarcane bow and flower arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often <b>described</b> <b>to</b> hold. She is also <b>described</b> <b>to</b> love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.|$|E

5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in her ear.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the fury {{of one of his}} former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he <b>described</b> <b>to</b> Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{is often}} named as the fifth or sixth Mahavidya (Mahavidyas are {{a group of}} ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu escoetric {{tradition}} of Tantra), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of Devi, the Hindu Mother goddess. Kinsley says that three Mahavidyas– Kali, Tara, and Chhinnamasta– are prominent among Mahavidya depictions and lists, but that Chhinnamasta barely has an independent existence outside the group. The Guhyatiguhya-Tantra (c. 9th century) equates the god Vishnu's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar Narasimha is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> have arisen from Chhinnamasta. A similar list in Mundamala Tantra (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parshurama.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> survive on the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, {{after which they}} are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E

He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934, Germany {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Poland, which {{disrupted}} the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe. In March 1939, Hitler demanded {{the return of}} the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would {{come to the aid of}} Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler <b>described</b> <b>to</b> his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland and he expected this time they would be met by force.|$|E
5|$|In one {{instance}} in the Ramayana, Surabhi is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> {{live in the}} city of Varuna – the Lord of oceans – which is situated below the earth in Patala (the netherworld). Her flowing sweet milk is said to form Kshiroda or the Kshirasagara, the cosmic milk ocean. In the Udyoga Parva book of the Mahabharata, this milk is said to be of six flavours and has the essence of all the best things of the earth. The Udyoga Parva specifies that Surabhi inhabits the lowest realm of Patala, known as Rasatala, and has four daughters – the Dikpalis – the guardian cow goddesses of the heavenly quarters: Saurabhi in the east, Harhsika in the south, Subhadra in the west and Dhenu in the north.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Surabhi is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> be {{distressed by}} the {{treatment}} of her sons—the oxen—in fields. Her tears are considered a bad omen for the gods by Indra, the god-king of heaven. The Vana Parva book of the Mahbharata also narrates a similar instance: Surabhi cries {{about the plight of}} her son—a bullock, who is overworked and beaten by his peasant-master. Indra, moved by Surabhi's tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.|$|E
5|$|Kubera is the {{treasurer}} of the gods and overlord of the semi-divine Yakshas, the Guhyakas, Kinnaras and Gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals, who please him. The Rakshasas also serve Kubera, however, some cannibalistic Rakshasas are <b>described</b> <b>to</b> have sided with Ravana {{in the battle against}} Kubera. Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as Kameshvara ("Lord of Kama – pleasure, desire etc."). He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, especially left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted left-over food and is in one legend <b>described</b> <b>to</b> be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be <b>described</b> <b>to</b> produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially <b>described</b> <b>to</b> science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is <b>described</b> <b>to</b> be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The {{size and shape}} of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two <b>described</b> <b>to</b> date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E
