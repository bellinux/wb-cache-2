5|$|Although Edward reigned {{for only}} {{six years and}} {{died at the age}} of 15, his reign made a lasting {{contribution}} to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England. The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to more conservative values. By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation. In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Roman Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{week after}} the Miami game, the Seminoles had an even closer call against the Clemson Tigers—their closest, in <b>fact,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire season. Despite the return of Peter Warrick, who was cleared of charges in a Florida courtroom, Florida State fell behind the Tigers in the first half. Trailing in Clemson, South Carolina, 143 at halftime, Florida State cut the gap to 146 with a field goal midway through the third quarter, then tied the game {{at the end of}} the third quarter with a {{touchdown}} and two-point conversion. The Seminoles clinched the victory after a field goal late in the fourth quarter gave them a 1714 lead and cemented the victory when a Clemson attempt to even the score with a field goal fell short. The victory was FSU head coach Bobby Bowden's 300thwin and came against his son, Tommy Bowden, coach of the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|Unger looks {{closely at}} existential {{projects}} that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic (Buddhism, which tries but cannot divest itself of the world).

25|$|A {{charge of}} murder was brought against him, and a {{commission}} was issued to try it. The case came {{on at the}} Old Bailey, in London, before Baron Burland, on 11 December 1774.

The <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killing was undisputed, but from the peculiar nature of the proceedings, there could not be, as in a common indictment for murder, a conviction for manslaughter; and the judge directed the jury, if they did not believe the killing to be malicious and deliberate, absolutely to acquit the prisoner. The jury brought in a verdict of acquittal.|$|E
25|$|During that conflict, France {{had been}} pinned down in Europe {{fighting}} Continental powers while Britain defeated the French navy and won victories in India, the West Indies and North America. However, Britain's strategic {{position at the}} beginning of 1778 was far different from the one she enjoyed in 1756. Gone was the alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia: in 1778 Britain was diplomatically isolated and without European allies. In the first months of this year, Britain attempted, without success, to find a Continental ally to engage the power of France. This failure produced the central strategic <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War of 1778: there would be no competing European campaigns to absorb France's strength. European isolation didn't matter in peacetime, but Britain was at serious disadvantage without European allies in war against France.|$|E

25|$|On December 23, 1917, Sykes (who {{had been}} sent to France in mid-December to see what was {{happening}} with the Projet d'Arrangement) and a representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the Central Syrian Congress in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.|$|E
25|$|Islamic eschatology is {{concerned}} with the Qiyamah (end of the world; Last Judgement) and the final judgement of humanity. Eschatology relates to one of the six articles of faith (aqidah) of Islam. Like the other Abrahamic religions, Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of Jannah (Heaven), while the unrighteous are punished in Jahannam (Hell). A significant fraction (one third, in <b>fact)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran deals with these beliefs, with many hadith elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as fitna (a test) and malahim (or ghayba in the shi'ite tradition).|$|E
25|$|When this sea, {{called the}} Littorina Sea, the {{ancestor}} of the Baltic Sea, withdrew, the Dalälven found itself blocked at Avesta {{by one of}} these eskers formed by the ice sheet: Badelundaåsen. In effect, before the ice age, the river continued {{in the direction of}} the Mälaren, in which it emptied itself and it so had flooded a valley along this entire section. Because of the <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence of this obstacle, it was forced to head northeast. So, in the whole section of the Lower Dalälven, the river did not have the time to flood a true valley. It thus had to adapt itself to the topology of the terrain, forming large fjärds with many isles in the flattest sections and by contrast a course narrower and faster at the different eskers encountered along the way.|$|E
