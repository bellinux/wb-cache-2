[...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman.

His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E

Only 10,000 tickets were printed for the inaugural game and 20,000 people showed up. Both Hoover and Lang had to find pots, bowls and any other available receptacles to collect admission fees. Stanford won the game. In 1892 Hoover invited Polish composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski to give a benefit concert. Hoover and his associates were unable to pay Paderewski the entire honorarium. The musician after hearing their story returned them the money so they could pay for rental of the concert hall. In 1919 Paderewski, now prime minister of Poland, traveled to America to thank the head of the American Relief Administration for helping Poland. [...] "That's all right, Mr. Paderewski," [...] Hoover replied.

2500|$|The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, {{was home}} to the first known secret collegiate society in the United States, the F.H.C. Society (founded in 1750).

[...] William & Mary alumnus and third American president, Thomas Jefferson, was perhaps the most famous member of the F.H.C. Society. Other notable members of the original society included Col. James Innes, St. George Tucker, and George Wythe. Jefferson noted that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> of Wm. & Mary college of this state, there existed a society called the F.H.C. society, confined to the number of six students only, of which I was a member, but it had no useful object, nor do I know whether it now exists." [...] The best opinion is that the society did not survive the British invasion of Virginia {{at the end of the}} American Revolution.
