5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress. Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties {{up to eight}} years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the conditions of}} elderly individuals living in rural southwestern Ethiopia by investigating their daily activities and their work lives, including how and with whom they work. This research was conducted primarily in one location in southwestern Ethiopia where many Aari individuals reside. All 16 elderly individuals, known as galta, who resided in this region received perfect scores on a measure {{of their ability to}} perform basic activities of <b>daily</b> <b>livings</b> (ADLs). They attempted to reduce their <b>daily</b> workloads by <b>living</b> near those who were related to them by blood or by marriage. Aari individuals who decrease their social interaction due to age or sickness are said to be tired (lanqta). Even elderly people without relatives required additional support. Indeed, galta often face severe hardships, but they can earn a living by relying on longstanding social relationships initially established before they became galta...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their <b>daily</b> <b>living</b> activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E

They have examined fan identities, fan behaviours, fan communities, fandom, fan consumption patterns and anti [...] ‐‑fans with different methods such as applying sociological, psychological, economical, and cultural approaches.

This dissertation mainly focuses on drafting portraits {{of a group of}} Hong Kong fans who are supporting a Japanese boy band called Arashi. In order to discuss their subconscious identities, motivations, fan activities and unauthorised fan groups organisations, this research has been carried out grounding on an anthropological approach that ethnographic participant‐observations and interviews were applied to form case studies. To depict these cases, <b>daily</b> <b>livings</b> of individual Hong Kong Arashi admirers, events organised by unofficially formed fan groups, and researcher’s experiences of attending Arashi’s live concerts were documented and analysed. At last, a summary is drawn to illustrate the significant of these Hong Kong fans. The key implication of this thesis is to provide a new perspective on studying individual fans and fandom as an aca-fan. There are also case studies to unfold fans’ inner mechanisms on choosing and ranking idols as well as how do they interpret their idols into new meanings. This paper is not a generalisation of Hong Kong fans of popular music but an attempt to demonstrate different representations from cases of Arashi’s fans in Hong Kong by means of ethnography documentations. published_or_final_versionModern Languages and CulturesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of <b>daily</b> <b>living.</b> Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

In this paper, electrophysiological signals from the human upper limb are used as a control interface between the user and a virtual robotic wheelchair.

In this paper we present the results obtained in our virtual reality laboratory at Macquarie University, showing that non-invasive upper limb signals from high density wearable sensing shirt can be utilized to continuously decode the kinematics of 2 D arm movements. Our results also show that body signals contain an information about the neural representation of movement. Moreover, they provide an alternative way for developing non-invasive body-machine interfaces, which have diverse clinical applications and access to these signals may provide understanding of functional brain states at various stages of development and aging. 4 page(s...|$|R

The current in-home monitoring systems face several challenges: (1) visual sensor calibration {{is a difficult}} task and not practical in real-life {{because of the need}} for recalibration when the visual sensors are moved accidentally by a caregiver or the senior citizen, (2) privacy concerns, and (3) the high hardware installation cost. We propose to use a network of cheap low-resolution visual sensors (30 × 30 [*][*]pixels) for long-term behavior analysis. The behavior analysis starts by visual feature selection based on foreground/background detection to track the motion level in each visual sensor. Then a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to estimate the user’s locations without calibration. Finally, an activity discovery approach is proposed using spatial and temporal contexts. We performed experiments on 10 months of real-life data. We show that the HMM approach outperforms the k-nearest neighbor classifier against ground truth for 30 days.

40|$|The {{notion of}} smart home has been {{extensively}} discussed in ubiquitous computing literature. There are some real experiences with smart homes mostly in Domotic and Ambient Assisted Livings.

For making smart homes as new types of dwelling in future cities, designers need to take in to account users' preferences and satisfaction factors of future <b>daily</b> <b>livings</b> and future home environments in smart home design. In this paper, we explore users' satisfaction factors that affect smart home design. Since users' satisfaction factors of a smart home are based on not only technical aspects but also on other living and spatial aspects, we propose a conceptual framework for eliciting users' preferences of both living preferences and environmental preferences. This elicitation process is based on multiple virtual experiments which {{are discussed in the}} paper. The upcoming results give designers a true understanding of people's latent needs and preferences of a smart home. Such a user-centered design approach leads to increase the acceptance of smart homes and gives designers the opportunity of making smart homes for everybody...|$|R
