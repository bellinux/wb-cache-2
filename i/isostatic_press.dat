50|$|After the {{relatively}} short sintering period, the component {{is placed in}} a hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>press</b> (HIP) and processed for 3 - 10 hours at ~ 30 kpsi(~200 MPa) at a temperature {{similar to that of}} the initial sintering. The applied isostatic pressure provides additional driving force for densification by substantially increasing the atomic diffusion coefficients, which promotes additional viscous flow at or near grain boundaries and intergranular pores. Using this method, transparent yttria nanomaterials were produced at lower temperatures, shorter total firing times, and without extra additives which tend to reduce the thermal conductivity.|$|E
5000|$|Hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIP). Here the powder (normally gas atomized, spherical type) is filled into a mould, normally {{consisting of a}} metallic [...] "can" [...] of suitable shape. The can is vibrated, then evacuated and sealed. It is then placed in a hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>press,</b> where it is heated to a homologous temperature of around 0.7, and subjected to an external gas pressure of ~100MPa (1000bar, 15,000psi) for 10-100minutes. This results in a shaped part of full density with as-wrought or better, properties. HIP was invented in the 1950-60s and entered tonnage production in the 1970-80s.

40|$|Abstract. Selective Laser Sintering could {{manufacture}} high complex {{metal parts}} in short time but with high porosity and low strength. The components from Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> have excellent performance with uniform organizational structure, high size precision, and high density. It, however, could not form high complex parts {{because of the}} difficulties of bag manufacture. So {{it will be a}} good method to combine Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> to make complicated metal parts. In this paper, the specimens of stainless steel were made by the combined Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> forming route. And the simulation of Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> was carried out by finite element method and Drucker-Prager-Cap constitutive model in ABAQUS/Explicit computer program. The property of metal powder was measured by experiments. The effects of bag on Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> have been discussed. It is different from the Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> of metal powder that the bag has little influence on both shape and size of the specimen. The results of simulation show a good agreement between the experimental results and the calculated results. The simulation can give a useful direction to dimension and shape designs of the combined forming of Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrestressed wire winded {{framework}} (PWWF) is {{an advanced}} {{structure and the}} most expensive part in the large-scale equipment. The traditional design of PWWF is complicated, highly iterative and cost uncontrolable, because PWWF is a variable stiffness multi-agent structure, with non-linear loading and deformation coordination. In this paper, cost optimization method of large-scale PWWF by multiple-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) is presented. Optimization design flow and optimization model are proposed based on variable-tension wire winding theory. An example of the PWWF cost optimization of isostatic equipment with axial load 6 000 kN is given. The optimization cost is reduced by 21. 6 % compared with traditional design. It has also been verified by the finite-element analysis and successfully applied to an actual PWWF design of <b>isostatic</b> <b>press.</b> The results show that this method is efficient and reliable.

40|$|Currently, three {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for producing porous NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) from elemental powders. These include conventional sintering, Self-propagating High temperature Synthesis (SHS), and sintering at elevated pressure via a Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Press</b> (HIP). Conventional sintering requires long heating times and samples are limited in shape and pore size. SHS is initiated by a thermal explosion ignited {{at one end of}} the specimen, which then propagates through the specimen in a self-sustaining manner. One of the difficulties with SHS is the inability to control intermetallic phases. This work will focus on the fabrication and characterization of porous NiTi SMA material produced from elemental powders via HIPping. Porous NiTi SMA was produced from elemental Ni and Ti powders at elevated temperature and pressure using a Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Press</b> (HIP). Small and large pore specimens containing average pore sizes ranging from 20 microns up to 1 mm have been produced by slightly varying the HIPping sintering temperatures and times. Quasi-static and dynamic loading experiments are conducted on various samples produced using the presented methodology and their shape recovery and energy absorption characteristics are measured during the forward and reverse phase transformation and detwinning.

40|$|Films of {{titanium}} nitride deposited by {{physical vapor deposition}} on 304 L stainless steel substrates were hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressed</b> (HIP) under 150 MPa at 550 °C. To {{study the effects of}} this treatment on the microstructure of those films, X-ray diffraction analyses, Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were performed.

The hot isostatic pressure leads to an increase of hardness for depths up to 0. 1 µm and a crystallographic texture change from (111) to (200). The original TiN golden color turned to red after the treatment. An increase of the grain size has been observed for hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressed</b> samples, but the stoichiometry of the TiN film was determined to be 1 : 1 by RBS.
