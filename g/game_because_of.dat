5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of Origin debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{the rushing}} success of its {{previous}} drive, Virginia Tech used fullback Josh Oglesby {{in tandem with}} Williams, who also figured prominently in the team's second possession of the half. The two men combined for 19 yards on the first three plays of the drive, then Williams exited the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> an injury. After play resumed, Taylor gained 10 yards on a rushing play and completed a 23-yard pass before Oglesby carried the ball again. When the third quarter ended, Virginia Tech faced second down at the Tennessee 30-yard line, still leading 24-14.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|Media {{and fans}} of college {{football}} consider the UT program {{one of the great}} powerhouses of the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the school's winning record as well as their previous national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970. From 1936 to 2004, the team finished the season in the top ten team of the Associated Press Poll 23 times, or one-third of the time. At the start of the 2005 season, the Longhorns were one of the most victorious programs in college football history; they were third in total victories and fourth if measured by winning percentage.|$|E

He made his debut for the Wales semi-pro team in their 4–2 defeat to Italy on 14 November 2007. He {{was part of}} the semi-pro team to play against England C in February 2008, and he scored in their 2–1 defeat with a shot from 20yards.

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{retains the}} main plot {{elements}} of Agatha Christie's {{novel of the}} same name. An additional ending {{is presented in the}} game which differs from the conclusion of Christie's novel. As with And Then There Were None, Christie's novel is bundled with the game. Some reviewers of Murder on the Orient Express criticized the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to And Then There Were None, as well as convincing voice acting and audio effects. Murder on the Orient Express is followed by , the third installment in the Agatha Christie series.|$|E
5|$|Protecting both quarterbacks was {{a strong}} {{offensive}} line anchored by All-American guard Rodney Hudson, a two-time winner of the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, a four-time recipient of all-conference honors and {{a finalist for the}} Outland Trophy. Hudson and the offensive line also protected Florida State's running backs. Foremost among these was sophomore Chris Thompson, who led the team with 687rushing yards. Thompson was predicted to start the ACC Championship <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his performance in the regular season and because fellow running backs Ty Jones and Jermaine Thomas were injured. Taken together, Florida State's offense was 52nd in total offense, accumulating 391yards per game.|$|E

On the defense, linebacker Rey Maualuga suffered a hip injury and safety Kevin Ellison broke his nose. An uncommon number of injuries, especially along the offensive line, depleted reserve players and forced Trojans {{to reach out to}} the general student population in order to find students with previous lineman experience to help on the scout team's offensive line; however, none were officially added to the roster.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won their}} fifth {{game of the}} season against the Baltimore Colts on a muddy field during a rainstorm. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle, the Colts began the scoring on the fourth play of the game with a 78-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Billy Hillenbrand. A few minutes later, the Browns evened the score after a pass from Graham set up a short touchdown run by Edgar Jones. The Colts retook the lead in the second quarter with a field goal by Rex Grossman and led 10–7 at the half. Focusing on the running <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the muddy conditions, the Browns scored a touchdown in the third quarter that put them in the lead for good. Jones, who was returning from a rib injury, finished the day with 61 yards and two touchdowns, while Motley ran for 130 yards. The slippery and windy conditions caused miscues on both sides. Tittle and Motley had fumbles, and Cleveland botched a fake field goal attempt in the second quarter. The final score was 14–10. While the Browns had won their first five games, the San Francisco 49ers were {{at the top of the}} AAFC's eastern division standings, having won all six of their games.|$|E

5|$|As expected, Ezeh, who had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury, redshirted his freshman year. Prior to his redshirt freshman season, he changed jersey numbers from 44 to 45 as he converted from fullback to linebacker. On May 22, 2007, {{he was charged with}} suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated for an incident when his vehicle struck a utility pole on the same street on which he lives while his blood-alcohol content was 0.11% (the legal limit in Michigan is 0.08%). Ezeh pleaded not guilty, and the trial was scheduled for September 19 in the 15th District Court. The time of the accident was outside the permissible times for Ezeh's restricted driving license that resulted from a prior non-alcohol-related accident. On the football field, redshirt freshman Ezeh entered the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team in a three-way battle to replace NFL-bound David Harris at middle linebacker with redshirt junior John Thompson and junior college transfer Austin Panter, who had been named national junior college defensive player of the year. Harris also hailed from Grand Rapids and had worn the number 45. The week before the season opener, The Detroit News declared Ezeh the starter, however, the Ann Arbor News and Ezeh's hometown The Grand Rapids Press both stated that the race between Ezeh and Thompson was undecided heading into the game. In the aftermath of the September 1, opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, more was made of the fact that both players had trouble playing the position than who had started the game. Ezeh started the first game, but lost his spot to Thompson in the next two. After three weeks of play, Thompson, who had been voted the hardest hitter on the team the previous two seasons, had established himself as the starter by ranking second on the team in tackles. However, although Thompson had stepped up to the role he was notable for having trouble with pass coverage. Ezeh accumulated no statistics in the third and fourth game, but recorded his first interception in the fifth game on September 29 against Northwestern on a deflected pass. Ezeh started that <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> an injury. The following week, he again started in place of the injured Thompson and recorded nine tackles against Eastern Michigan. He also forced a fumble and fielded one kickoff return. Even though Thompson recovered from his ankle injury after four weeks, Ezeh retained the starting job the remainder of the season for a total of ten starts. Thompson only recorded four tackles the rest of the year. On November 1, his lawyer stated that on August 29 Ezeh had pleaded guilty to an operating while visibly intoxicated charge, which is a serious misdemeanor but a lesser charge than the original operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and had sought alcohol counseling prior to his sentence. The plea resulted in a year's probation, three days in a work release program, a substantial payment covering fines, court costs and restitution. He committed to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class. In the November 3 Paul Bunyan Trophy victory against Michigan State he recorded a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. One of the sacks occurred on Michigan State's final series of downs in Michigan territory to help secure the 2824 win. Ezeh recorded 12 tackles in the Michigan – Ohio State rivalry game against Ohio State on November 17 to end the regular season.|$|E
