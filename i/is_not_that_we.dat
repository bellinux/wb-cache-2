2500|$|This {{interpretation}} (and {{the criticism}} of Wittgenstein that arises from it) {{is based on a}} complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument {{has nothing to do with}} the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the intelligibility of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will not in fact remember the sensation correctly, but rather that it makes no sense to talk of our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts it, is not so much that private language is [...] "a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose".|$|E
2500|$|Richard Fass puts {{forward the}} {{possibility}} that business scandals {{in the real world}} make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. [...] Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> love honesty less, but that we love success more." [...] Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, {{it has been shown that}} the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.|$|E
60|$|The {{death of}} the man who was our father changed our lives. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{suffered}} a great grief; the chief trouble was the unanswered crying of failure.

6000|$|At {{moments like}} these {{there is no}} doubt--and psychologists {{actually}} assert it--that there is in us a sense which has {{absolutely nothing to do}} with the other five: it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> see, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hear or touch, yet we seem to do all three at once. Marguerite sat there with her eyes apparently closed. Sir Andrew was immediately behind her, and on her right was the table with the five-armed candelabra upon it. Before her mental vision there was absolutely nothing but Armand's face. Armand, whose life was in the most imminent danger, and who seemed to be looking at her from a background upon which were dimly painted the seething crowd of Paris, the bare walls of the Tribunal of Public Safety, with Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, demanding Armand's life in the name of the people of France, and the lurid guillotine with its stained knife waiting for another victim [...] .

60|$|I have {{received}} a serious, and to me, at any rate, an impressive remonstrance from the Scottish Patriotic Association. It appears that I recently referred to Edward VII. of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, under the horrible description of the King of England. The Scottish Patriotic Association draws my {{attention to the fact}} that by the provisions of the Act of Union, and the tradition of nationality, the monarch should be referred to as the King of Britain. The blow thus struck at me is particularly wounding because it is particularly unjust. I believe in the reality of the independent nationalities under the British Crown much more passionately and positively than any other educated Englishman of my acquaintance believes in it. I am quite certain that Scotland is a nation; I am quite certain that nationality is the key of Scotland; I am quite certain that all our success with Scotland has been due to the fact that we have in spirit treated it as a nation. I am quite certain that Ireland is a nation; I am quite certain that nationality is the key to Ireland; I am quite certain that all our failure in Ireland arose from the fact that we would not in spirit treat it as a nation. It would be difficult to find, even among the innumerable examples that exist, a stronger example of the immensely superior importance of sentiment to what is called practicality than this case of the two sister nations. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have encouraged a Scotchman to be rich; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have encouraged a Scotchman to be active; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have encouraged a Scotchman to be free. It is that we have quite definitely encouraged a Scotchman to be Scotch.|$|E
60|$|Our {{author is}} apt to remonstrate with his anthropological critics, and to assure them that he also has made studies in {{ethnology}}. 'I am not such a despairer of ethnology as some ethnologists would have me.' He refers us to the assistance which he lent in bringing out Dr. Hahn's Tsuni-Goam (1881), Mr. Gill's Myths and Songs from the South Pacific (1876), and probably other examples could be added. But my objection <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be ungrateful to Mr. Max Muller for these and other valuable services to anthropology, but that, when he has got his anthropological material, he treats it in what I think the wrong way, or approves of its being so treated.|$|E
6000|$|Those {{particular}} {{passengers in}} the figure, present the New Republic. It is a dissension, an inquiry, {{it is the}} vague unconsolidated matter for a new direction. [...] "We who are young," [...] says {{the spirit of the}} New Republic, [...] "we who are in earnest can no more compass our lives under these old kingships and loyalties, under these old leaders and these old traditions, constitutions and pledges, with their party liabilities, their national superstitions, their rotting banners and their accumulating legacy of feuds and lies, than we can pretend we are indeed impassioned and wholly devoted subjects of King Edward, spending our lives in the service of his will. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have revolted from these things, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have grown askew to them and that patching and amendment will serve our need; it is that we have travelled outside them altogether--almost inadvertently, but quite beyond any chance of return to a simple acceptance again. We are no more disposed to call ourselves Liberals or Conservatives and to be stirred to party passion at the clash of these names, than we are to fight again the battles of the Factio Albata or the Factio Prasina. These current dramas, these current conflicts seem scarcely less factitious. Men without faith may be content to spend their lives for things only half believed in, and for causes that are contrived. But that is not our quality. We want reality because we have faith, we seek the beginning of realism in social and political life, we seek it and we are resolved to find it." ...|$|E

6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> counted our loss in numbers, {{nor that}} our bodies were more illy fitted to stand the strain; {{but we were}} sorely {{weakened}} because of lacking that with which to fight.

60|$|But we have {{delayed the}} main {{argument}} {{too long for}} the parenthetical purpose of showing that the great democratic dream, like the great mediaeval dream, has in a strict and practical sense been a dream unfulfilled. Whatever is the matter with modern England it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have carried out too literally, or achieved with disappointing completeness, either the Catholicism of Becket or the equality of Marat. Now I have taken these two cases merely because they are typical of ten thousand other cases; {{the world is full}} of these unfulfilled ideas, these uncompleted temples. History does not consist of completed and crumbling ruins; rather it consists of half-built villas abandoned by a bankrupt-builder. This world is more like an unfinished suburb than a deserted cemetery.|$|E

[...] "I have told him already that I think that the prejudices will be too hard for him, and that he had better give it up before he adds to his own misery, and perhaps to hers. What I have said has not been in the way of pleading,--but only as showing the ground on which I think that such a marriage would be inexpedient.

You are watching me; I don't want to be watched. I want to go my own way; to work when I choose and to loaf when I choose.

6000|$|The first speaker smiled compassionately, {{and perhaps}} {{also a little}} patronizingly. [...] "I'm not {{sure that you have}} met the point exactly. Metchnikoff denies, on the basis of {{scientific}} knowledge, that it is possible for a man, being dead, to live again. In those two extremely interesting chapters of his, which treat of the 'Religious Remedies' and the 'Philosophical Remedies' for the 'disharmonies of the human constitution,' he is quite as unsparing of the sages as of the saints. The Christians and the Buddhists fare no worse than Plato and the Stoics; the last are no less unscientific than the first in his view, and no less fallacious. What he asks <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall be resigned or enraptured in view of death, but that we shall physically desire it when we are tired of living, just as we physically desire sleep when we are tired of waking." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} no loving heart here. All alone he had to endure the {{crushing}} weight of his misfortunes. How often has a man said, when evil times have come upon him, {{that he could have}} borne it all without complaint, but for his wife and children? The truth, however, has been that, but for them, he could not have borne it at all. Why does any man suffer with patience [...] "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," [...] or put up with [...] "the whips and scorns of time," [...] but that he does so for others, not for himself? It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should all be ready, each to make his own quietus with a bare bodkin; but that we should run from wretchedness when it comes in our path. Who fights for himself alone? Who would not be a coward, if none but himself saw the battle--if none others were concerned in it? ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{with these}} things in mind that those who profess the new faith are {{becoming}} so markedly anxious to distinguish God from the Trinitarian's deity. At present if anyone who has left the Christian communion declares himself a believer in God, priest and parson swell with self-complacency. There {{is no reason why}} they should do so. That many of us have gone from them and found God is no concern of theirs. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> who went out into the wilderness which we thought to be a desert, away from their creeds and dogmas, have turned back and are returning. It is that we have gone on still further, and are beyond that desolation. Never more shall we return to those who gather under the cross. By faith we disbelieved and denied. By faith we said of that stuffed scarecrow of divinity, that incoherent accumulation of antique theological notions, the Nicene deity, [...] "This is certainly no God."

60|$|The difference, then, betwixt us {{and them}} <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are really two, but one body in Christ, in divers places. True, we are below stairs, and they above; they in their holiday, and we in our working-day clothes; they in harbour, but we in the storm; they at rest, and we in the wilderness; they singing, as crowned with joy; we crying, as crowned with thorns. But, I say, we are all of one house, one family, and are all the {{children}} of one Father. This, therefore, we must not forget, lest we debar ourselves of much of that which otherwise, while here, {{we have a right}} unto. Let us, therefore, I say, remember, that the temple of God is but one, though divided, as one may say into kitchen and hall, above stairs and below; or holy and most holy place. For it stands upon the same foundation, and is called but one, the temple of God; which is built upon the Lord our Saviour.|$|E
60|$|I {{do really}} {{believe that this is}} one of the ways in which God (don't get flurried, Nature if you like) is {{unexpectedly}} avenged on things infamous and unreasonable. And this method is that men's moral and even physical tenacity actually give out under such a load of lies. They go on writing their leading articles and their Parliamentary reports. They go on doing it as a convict goes on picking oakum. But the point <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are bored with their articles; the point is that they are. The work is done worse because it is done weakly and without human enthusiasm. And it is done weakly because of the truth we have told so many times in this book: that it is not done for monarchy, for which men will die; or for democracy, for which men will die; or even for aristocracy, for which many men have died. It is done for a thing called Capitalism: which stands out quite clearly in history in many curious ways. But the most curious thing about it is that no man has loved it; and no man died for it.|$|E
