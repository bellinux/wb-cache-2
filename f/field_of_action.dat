25|$|In Spaces of Hope Harvey {{argues that}} postmodern {{political}} movements have been indirectly responsible for weakening class issues (in the Marxist sense) {{and the critical}} consciousness of this <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> which, in his opinion, is now more significant than during the Fordist period. For Harvey this class conflict is far from solved (something postmodern theorists ignore, according to his argument): globalization has {{made it more difficult}} for labour organisations to tackle underpaid work in poor conditions without labour rights and the amount of surplus value earned by corporations is far larger because of the differential between the high prices paid by western consumers and the low wages earned by south-east Asian labourers.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 1775, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the Battle of Bunker Hill, Woodbridge marched his regiment in good order from the mainland across the Charlestown Neck, an isthmus connecting the mainland with the Charlestown Peninsula and the battlefield. The regiment was under fire from British naval vessels as they crossed the neck to reinforce Col. William Prescott's regiment; British vessels were bombarding the battlefield and the Charlestown Neck prior to the assault of the British troops. General Israel Putnam, riding his horse from the battlefield to the neck, met Woodbridge's regiment and urged them {{to run to the}} battlefield. The rush to battle caused confusion and separation of Woodbridge's men as they arrived at the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Parts of the regiment engaged and joined the battle.|$|E
25|$|Thierno Abdourahmane {{has tried}} to broaden the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of poets to other topics, for example: the {{material}} progress or the feeling of nature. It is not however clear of conventional trends, the religion and morals. However, he did not disengage of the classic trends, religion and morality themes. Thierno Abdourahmane resolves the lexical aspect {{of the development of}} African languages in the most natural way by adopting the designations with which objects or actions have been brought. This practice is also in Ogirde Malal of Thierno Mamadou Samba Mombeya. After this literary aspect of progress, the poet passes without transition to a different object, the strong condemnation of the abuse of power by the former canton chiefs. This part is a satirical breath, where emerges the compassion for the weak people, the anger against the injustice and tyranny.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge for}} the Swiss agri-food system is how to align food provision with environmental goals {{in the context of}} increasingly complex conditions. This paper describes a system dynamics model that analyses the trade-offs and synergies between these goals arising from different <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The model is grounded in the social-ecological systems framework and was developed in a participatory process with stakeholders across the Swiss agri-food system. Model analysis indicates that yield improvements and the implementation of more sustainable production systems have important leverage for increasing food provision and simultaneously improving environmental performance. However, these <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> need to be complemented by <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> outside agriculture such as reductions in food waste and losses or changes in consumption patterns. Model analysis also shows that the feedback perspective, inherent to the system dynamics methodology, promises to yield valuable synergies with the social-ecological systems approach...|$|R

25|$|The {{progression}} of the war demonstrated the South's disadvantage in engineering expertise; of the initial 65 cadets who resigned from West Point to accept positions with the Confederate Army, only seven {{were placed in the}} Corps of Engineers. To overcome this obstacle, the Confederate Congress passed legislation that gave a company of engineers to every division in the field; by 1865, they actually had more engineer officers serving in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> than the Union Army. The Army Corps of Engineers served as a main function in making the war effort logistically feasible. One of the main projects for the Army Corps of Engineers was constructing railroads and bridges, which Union forces took advantage of because railroads and bridges provided access to resources and industry. One area where the Confederate engineers were able to outperform the Union Army was in the ability to build fortifications that were used both offensively and defensively along with trenches that made them harder to penetrate. This method of building trenches was known as the zigzag pattern.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is to find out}} how {{participants}} in supervision experience the supervision process and how they estimate the significance of supervision for their personal and professional development. Two focus groups were included in the qualitative comparative study: a focus group of employees in an NGO, which offers psychosocial help to adolescents and children, and a focus group of students of social pedagogy, who are attending the optional course Supervision. The group interview with both groups was analysed by a hermeneutic method. As expected, the results showed that employees and students estimate supervision as important to their personal and professional development. But the expectations that employees will specify in more detail in which <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> supervision empowered them, were not met. Both groups clearly recognise and name these <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> yet these <b>fields</b> differ between the two groups.

2500|$|Dumézil {{maintains}} that Jupiter is not himself a god {{of war and}} agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view {{is based on the}} methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god Varuna) and lawful right (by the Vedic god Mitra). However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour).|$|E
