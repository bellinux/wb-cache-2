The mould can be a male or <b>female</b> <b>mould.</b> To make shower bathtubs, a male mould is used. In the boating industry, a single-sided <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> made from FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic) is used to make yacht hulls. The outer shell of the mould is stiffened by a wood frame. The mould is made by taking the reversal of a male pattern. Several different hull sizes can be made using the same mould. The length of the mould is shortened or lengthened using inserts and mould secondaries such as windows, air vents, and propeller shaft tunnels.|$|E

50|$|Most modern acrylic {{canopies}} are vacuum formed. A {{sheet of}} acrylic is secured to a <b>female</b> <b>mould,</b> then the entire assembly is heated in an oven until the acrylic is pliable. The air is then {{removed from the}} mould and the acrylic sheet is drawn into it, forming {{the shape of the}} canopy. The acrylic is then trimmed to the appropriate shape and attached to an aluminum or composite frame. Some one-off canopies are made in a similar fashion, but since a mould would be too time-consuming to make, the acrylic is heated and vacuum formed until it approximates the shape the builder is seeking. This type of construction is less precise, however, and each canopy is unique. If multiple canopies will be needed, a mould is almost always used.|$|E

50|$|Microthermoforming is the {{abbreviation}} for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have {{structures in the}} micrometre range and have their technical function provided by {{the shape of the}} microstructure 1. Thermoforming 2 in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into <b>female</b> <b>moulds</b> (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.|$|R

This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
40|$|The Caribbean is an {{archipelago}} {{that lies}} between the southern United States {{and the northern}} end of South America, dispersed with many closely spaced island nations. At the base of the archipelago sits the country of Trinidad and Tobago, the industrial hub of the Caribbean with an economy fueled by the oil and gas industries. With this Trinidad has the capability to support yacht construction, and both yacht and ship repair. With the current low in the global economy and with yachts being sold to Caribbean customers from the United States cheaply, it was undertaken to design a comfortable weekender powerboat for the local market to be produced in Trinidad. The design intent is that of a fast comfortable motor cruiser with the ability to host 4 guests in separate double cabins for a long weekend cruise throughout the Caribbean. The vessel style is to be {{similar to that of the}} Down East style lobster boats from Maine, USA. The vessel is to be easily constructed using simple production methods appropriate to the labor skill and industrial resources available at hand in the country. A comparison between different production technologies is undertaken in this study and the pros and cons of each weighed up aiding in the final decision. Material choice was governed as much by the structural requirements of the vessel as it was by the proposed production method and the working environment. Boat builders were asked about general fiberglass boat construction; their opinions and practical knowledge in reinforcement laying up techniques and issues were taken into consideration for the laminate schedule of the vessel also. Different mould tools are identified within this study from mass production <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> tools, temporary <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> tools and finally male mould tools.

5000|$|The {{roles that}} women play in film noir are the stylistic {{innovations}} of the heteronormative patriarchy, {{set up to}} be harmless supplements for the narrative. However, upon further investigation, they directly translate to the dark reality of the re-oppressed female post-World War II when women were expected to re-insert themselves back into the home after finding independence through the workforce. The narrative of film noir and the ever-present domestic space during the 1940s and 1950s is an obvious thematic representation of woman as other, in which the “attack on the dominant social values film noir is normally expressed through {{the representation of the}} family.” [...] Sylvia Harvey in her observations of the absence of the family in film noir manages to generate that a “woman’s place in the home determines her position in society, but also serves as a reflection of oppressive social relationships.” [...] This control over the domestic space that women carried when they entered the workforce during World War II was quick to be taken away when social order was attempted to restore itself after the war. Within the uneasy aesthetic of this film style, the harsh light and ominous visual cues of danger approaches the domestic space as a highly disturbed and broken social order, displacing viewers into recognizing the tension in the home and the women’s role in generating that narrative. In that recognizable visual cue that predetermines the gaze on film noir as male oriented, viewers are aware of the “artificial domestic milieu.” Women that are represented in film noir are no strangers to the danger that lies beyond the veil of fiction. There is a disruption in the domestic space by the rebelling <b>female</b> <b>moulds</b> of film noir, to which the male protagonists do not take {{to the success of the}} over the top narcissist and empowered female character lightly, similar to the reality of the unhappiness of the patriarchal order losing its grip on women.|$|R

I view entrepreneurship and gender as socially constructed, discursive phenomena. To uncover the processes of constructing gender in female entrepreneurship this paper applies a discursive framework, which treats language as a representational system producing and circulating meaning. The focus on language use as action implies that practises of writing and talking about female entrepreneurship ‘make’ gender as much as the women entrepreneurs) themselves: both involve working on culturally shared meanings to make reality intelligible. The data consists of articles published in Yrittäjä, a pro-SME magazine, in 1990 - 1997. In the analysis I show how gender is constructed in media talk. as a women’s issue Women entrepreneurs are constantly compared with men and with an implicitly masculine ideal of entrepreneurship and with strengths and weaknesses of women are displayed pointing out that the meaning making of gender taking place in the data refers to equality discourse. Finally I discuss possible consequences of the hegemonic equality discourse and suggest lines of further research...|$|R

The CAD model of the propeller is then input to other programs to generate detailed design drawings and to create templates for manufacturing a wooden pattern of the propeller.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Virtual and physical prototyping [© Taylor & Francis]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] use of stereolithography (SL) to make injection moulding tools has been shown previously to be an efficient way of producing rapid tools for simple geometries, aiming at small lot sizes with an acceptable degree of accuracy. This paper highlights the unexplored potential of using SL inserts in hybrid tools using practical experiments and FEA mould filling models. The practical experiments reveal problems incurred by uneven flow as a result of differential thermal conductivity between dissimilar mould materials in a hybrid tool. The FEA flow models confirm that this uneven flow would be anticipated when using FEA software. A further FEA stress analysis predicts that catastrophic mould failure will be expected under some conditions and these reflect the results found in the practical experiments. The use of a homogeneous SL tool eliminates the issues caused by uneven mould filling but results in thermal distortion of the <b>female</b> <b>mould.</b> Ultimately a SL tool backfilled with low melt point alloy provides a solution that eliminates the problems of uneven filling and thermal distortion...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} as part {{fulfillment of the}} degree of Yacht and Powercraft Design (BEng) at Southampton Solent University. The project developed the design of a 15 -metre, trawler-style flybridge motor yacht in addition to researching the potential use of propeller tunnels on the design hull. Trawler-style motor yachts are traditionally designed with long-distance cruising in mind and as such are typically round-bilge displacement or semi-displacement type hulls. There are however, a number of higher performance trawler-style motor yachts on the market aimed at weekend and shorter range cruising. These are produced by manufacturers such as Grand Banks, Hardy Marine, Seaward, Beneteau and Nimbus. This project centered around designing a similar higher performance hull in conjunction with an investigation into the potential use of propeller tunnels or pockets on such a hull. Tunnels or pockets have been and are used on several types of motor vessel including Tyne-class lifeboats, recreational motor yachts, commercial launches and naval vessels. There are several reasons for their use including draft reduction, increased propeller diameter (potential efficiency benefits), and reducing shaft angle (increased potential engine location options and thrust improvements). This report includes a tow tank investigation into the effect of propeller tunnels on hull drag alone, through comparison of two exact scale models. The models were constructed from GRP, one with tunnels and one without, from a GRP <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> taken from a similar style model hull. These models were then tow tank tested through a relevant speed range to compare resistance, heave and trim behaviour. The results indicated that up until the maximum design speed required by the brief, the use of partial propeller tunnels provided a small beneficial drag effect. Further in-depth results analysis and propeller efficiency research is provided within this report. However, {{on the basis of these}} results, a decision was taken to incorporate tunnel pockets into the design hull...|$|E

The proposed microfabrication technique is derived from a macroscale rapid prototyping technique called vacuum casting. It was optimized to reduce production cost, {{in order to produce}} small series (100 - 10 000 chip series) of chips to meet demand in today's market of cellulomics. Microfabrication technologies and rapid prototyping technologies are combined to shape the master part, which can thus involve microsized features. The corresponding <b>female</b> structure is <b>moulded</b> in a flexible silicone material. The duplicated polymer chips are obtained by casting a thermosetting plastic under vacuum. The dimensional replication accuracy between the master part and the duplicated parts is uniform over the duplicated parts and better than 1 %. Advantages of the proposed technique over existing plastic microfabrication techniques are discussed in the paper. Using this microfabrication technique, we produced a plastic biochip for highly parallelized transfection of arrays of living cells. The feasibility of parallel lipofection was demonstrated: two different plasmids encoding, respectively, eGFP and DsRED 2 were inserted into HEK 293 T cells.

40|$|Polypropylene is in a {{category}} of thermoplastic polymer resin. It {{is a part of}} both the average household and is in commercial and industrial applications. This plastic is regularly used for food containers because it needs to be dishwasher safe. Although the thermoforming process has been developed for over two decades but there are still some unsolved problems found in this technology. In the development commercial polypropylene grades, there are several critical problems addressed such as sheet quality, part uniformity and wall thickness, regrind use and dimensional stability. This project starts with searching various types of journal that related to the topic of designing and fabricating thermoplastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet via thermoforming process. Read and understand all the journals are the element in the effort to make this project. This study aims to design and fabricate plastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet with thickness 1 mm via thermoforming process. CATIA P 3 V 5 R 21 software by Dassault Systemes was used to design the plastic container and its mould. Design consideration for the plastic product and its mould is important as to reduce the defects. For example fillet was added to avoid sharp edge. Draft angle also was used at the wall side of mould which is to ease the process of absorption. Round shape plastic container was selected to be design as it has smooth shape that allows the pliable polypropylene sheet to form according to the shape of the mould. An aluminum block with dimension 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm was used as the female cavity been cut using band saw machine. The aluminum blocks was machined using Makino KE 55 CNC Milling Machine located at the Machining Laboratory. High Speed Drilling machine was used to drill the hole {{at the bottom of the}} <b>female</b> <b>mould.</b> 1 mm and 6 mm diameter of drill bits was used to make the holes at the bottom of aluminum mould. Moreover, this project studies the effect of thermoforming temperature and number of mould vent hole to 1 mm PP sheet. Two types of vent holes used on the aluminum mould which are 1 vent and 5 vent holes. There were two parameters used to fabricate polypropylene plastic container. The first parameter is the different degree of temperature used to heat the 1 mm polypropylene plastic sheet. The degree of temperature used is 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, and 175 °C. The second parameter that was used is different number of vent holes on the mould to fabricate the plastic container. The first one is 1 hole and secondly 5 holes, both ways was used same diameter of the vent hole which is 1 mm. Lastly the process to investigate the hardness property on the fabricated polypropylene plastic container was conducted using the Vickers Micro Hardness Tester to obtained the hardness value. Lowest value of HV range shows that the polypropylene plastic containers have uniform hardness. Based on the research conducted, the appearance of polypropylene plastic container at temperature 165 °C for 5 vent holes on mould almost goods compare to others temperature used.

40|$|Integral CFRP Wingcover for laminar Wing Technologies for {{reducing}} the fuel consumption are in the focus of future transport aircraft development. A significant reduction of friction-drag {{can be achieved by}} extending laminar flow on the wing upper side. Therefore it is necessary to keep surface irregularities within close limits, as even small disturbances like waviness, steps and gaps or fastener heads can cause an early transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Aiming on those objectives, the DLR Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems worked on the design and manufacturing concept for an integral wing upper cover together with its industrial partners Airbus, Premium Aerotec and gom. Anisotropic properties of composites, different thermal expansion coefficients of fibers and matrices and chemical shrinkage of the matrix cause process-induced deformations (PID) in composite structures, which can disturb laminar flow. In addition, the structure is deformed by aerodynamic loads in flight (load-induced deformations LID). Therefore the compliance with aerodynamic requirements for the laminar wing needs to take into account both effects in a coupled design process. Numerical analyses confirm, that with the choosen design the superposed deformations are within the limits for natural laminar flow. The manufacturing concept is based on aluminium cores for the integral stiffeners, while the outer skin is produced on a precise female tool. Prepreg material is draped around single cores, which are aligned to stringer-rows. In the last step the skin is being co-cured with the stiffeners. The concept has been verified by the manufacturing of 1, 0 m x 0, 6 m test samples. The test samples have been analyzed, using an optical 3 D measurement system, turning the attention to the surface waviness which is induced by the stiffeners. In the next step, the integral design is implemented in a 2, 4 m x 1, 5 m section of a full-scale wing upper cover. The structure is designed and sized for representative load cases and the cruise-flight pressure distribution is used for calculating the surface waviness. In close collaboration between sizing, design and manufacturing the aerodynamic requirements have been fulfilled without weight penalties. The tool consists of the <b>female</b> <b>mould</b> for the outer skin and 36 modular cores for the integral stiffeners. Hollow cores are flown through by hot air in the autoclave and allow faster heat-up rates and help to reduce process-time and energy consumption. A tolerance concept ensures the exact positioning of the aluminium cores and the specific use of their thermal elongation for the consolidation of the prepreg material during the curing-process. The high precision of the mating surfaces facilitates the assembly process of the wing box by reducing costly production steps like shimming. For the assessment of the surface waviness a tool chain has been developed to superpose process-induced deformations with load-induced deformations. As process-induced and load-induced deformations act in opposite directions, both effects compensate partly and result in a reduced waviness. The resulting waviness can be exported to a numerical transition analysis based on computational fluid dynamics. Christian Ückert, Olaf Steffen, Dr. -Ing.
