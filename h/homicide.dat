40|$|This study {{examines}} gang-motivated <b>homicides</b> in Chicago neighborhoods between 1985 and 1995. Qualitative studies have illustrated that gang-motivated <b>homicides</b> {{may have different}} characteristics than other types of <b>homicides.</b> Particularly at the neighborhood level, gang <b>homicides</b> {{have not yet been}} fully studied, and thus {{little is known about the}} interaction between gang violence and the neighborhoods they operate in. By examining the effects of social disorganization on both gang-related <b>homicides</b> and other types of homicides—such as intimate killings and <b>homicides</b> committed during street robberies—this study explores the relative uniqueness of gang <b>homicides.</b> Results indicate that social disorganization theory helps explain various types of <b>homicides,</b> including gang <b>homicides.</b> Nonetheless, gang homi-cides are also different from other types of <b>homicides,</b> justifying more research that looks at these <b>homicides</b> as a unique type of violence...|$|R
30|$|In the {{municipal}} death records missing data and no <b>homicides</b> are coded {{in the same}} way, since municipalities without <b>homicides</b> {{in a given year}} do not appear. To distinguish between non-response and zero values we use information on all deaths, either from <b>homicides</b> or other causes. We assume if a municipality reports values for all deaths but not <b>homicides,</b> there were no <b>homicides</b> and the value is zero. If a municipality does not report values for all deaths or <b>homicides,</b> we assume the information is missing and code the value as a non-response.|$|R

5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of <b>homicide</b> linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for <b>homicide</b> have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E

5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing <b>Homicide</b> into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because <b>Homicide</b> was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. <b>Homicide</b> followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Pembleton's {{investigation}} of fellow police officers for a suspicious shooting {{was based on}} a real-life investigation chronicled in David Simon's 1991 non-fiction book , from which the <b>Homicide</b> series was adapted. Baltimore Police Department Detective Donald Worden, on whom the Bolander character is based, handled the actual real-life investigation in 1988. However, Howard's affair with the perpetrator {{was not part of the}} real-life incident, but rather was added by Yoshimura as part of the show's efforts to ensure as many detectives were personally involved in the storylines as possible. Several members of the Baltimore Police Department publicly criticized <b>Homicide</b> for its negative portrayal of the police in the episode, and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to executive producer Barry Levinson over the matter. Cellist Zuill Bailey served as a body double for Ned Beatty in the scenes with Bolander playing cello. Bailey was studying at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory at the time, and his appearance on <b>Homicide</b> led to further collaborations with Tom Fontana, including a recurring guest appearance for Bailey on Fontana's drama series Oz.|$|E
2500|$|Toronto {{recorded}} {{its largest}} number of <b>homicides</b> in 1991 with 89, a rate of 3.9 per 100,000. In 2005, Toronto media coined the term [...] "Year of the Gun", because of {{a record number of}} gun-related <b>homicides,</b> 52, out of 80 <b>homicides</b> in total. The total number of <b>homicides</b> dropped to 70 in 2006, that year, nearly 2,000 people in Toronto were victims of a violent gun-related crime, about one-quarter of the national total. 84 <b>homicides</b> were committed in 2007, roughly half of which involved guns. Gang-related incidents have also been on the rise; between the years of 1997 and 2005, over 300 gang-related <b>homicides</b> have occurred. As a result, the Ontario government developed an anti-gun strategy. In 2011, Toronto's murder rate plummeted to 45 murders—nearly a 26% drop from the previous year. The 45 <b>homicides</b> were the lowest number the city has recorded since 1986. While subsequent years did see a return to higher rates, the nearly flat line of 56 <b>homicides</b> in 2012 and 57 in both 2013 and 2014 continued to be a significant improvement over the previous decade; and the year-to-date figure of 47 murders at November 23, 2015 continued that overall trend of improvement.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the relationship between}} neighborhood sociodemographic factors, community resources, and <b>homicides</b> involving young children. We performed spatial analysis of children under age five murdered in Harris County, Texas, from 1997 to 2003. Data on county population, household, socioeconomic, and residential mobility characteristics were allocated to census block groups. Age-adjusted spatial clusters of the <b>homicides</b> were identified. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo negative binomial regression risk model tested the relationship of age-adjusted number of child <b>homicides</b> to block group characteristics and distance of victim’s residence to community resources. Child maltreatment accounted for 94 % of 125 <b>homicides.</b> In all, 64 % were concentrated in 12 age-adjusted spatial clusters involving 3 % of county area. Predictors for number of <b>homicides</b> were {{a larger number of}} single-parent households (male and female) and lower median household income. Distance to nearest community resources was not significant. Spatial clusters of child <b>homicides</b> were associated with low-income neighborhoods and single-parent (male and female) households. No association between the spatial clusters of child <b>homicides</b> and their proximity to community resources was observed. A high percentage of child <b>homicides</b> were concentrated in a small area of the county, which offers the potential for targeted, cost-effective interventions...|$|R
