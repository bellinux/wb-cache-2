In this paper, a method for <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> reliability evaluation to meet the required levels of <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> differences of various graph-theoretic connectivity measures is proposed. A concept of <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> reliability degree is proposed and a <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> reliability entropy-based method for analyzing the proposed reliability measure is discussed. This method is based on <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> survivability and stability analyses. Its core is the computation of some <b>heterogeneous</b> wireless <b>network</b> combinatorial invariants.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{cellular}} networks, a <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>network</b> (sometimes known as a HetNet) is a network that uses several types of base stations macro-base stations, pico-base stations, and/or femto-base stations {{in order to provide}} better coverage and bit rates. This is in particular used to cope with the difficulty of covering with macro-base stations only open outdoor environment, office buildings, homes, and underground areas. Recent Poisson-based models have been developed to derive the coverage probability of such networks in the downlink case. The general approach is to have a number or layers or [...] "tiers"' of networks which are then combined or superimposed onto each other into one heterogeneous or multi-tier network. [...] If each tier is a Poisson network, then the combined network is also a Poisson network owing to the superposition characteristic of Poisson processes. Then the Laplace transform for this superimposed Poisson model is calculated, leading to the coverage probability in (the downlink channel) of a cellular network with multiple tiers when a user is connected to the instantaneously strongest base station and when a user is connected to the strongest base station on average (not including small scale fading).|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a surge of {{interests}} on <b>heterogeneous</b> information <b>network</b> analysis. As a newly emerging <b>network</b> model, <b>heterogeneous</b> information <b>networks</b> have many unique features (e. g., complex structure and rich semantics) {{and a number of}} interesting data mining tasks have been exploited in this kind of networks, such as similarity measure, clustering, and classification. Although evaluating the importance of objects has been well studied in homogeneous networks, it is not yet exploited in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>networks.</b> In this paper, we study the ranking problem in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>networks</b> and propose the HRank framework to evaluate the importance of multiple types of objects and meta paths. Since the importance of objects depends upon the meta paths in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>networks,</b> HRank develops a path based random walk process. Moreover, a constrained meta path is proposed to subtly capture the rich semantics in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>networks.</b> Furthermore, HRank can simultaneously determine the importance of objects and meta paths through applying the tensor analysis. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show that HRank can effectively evaluate the importance of objects and paths together. Moreover, the constrained meta path shows its potential on mining subtle semantics by obtaining more accurate ranking results. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
