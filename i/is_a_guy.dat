The film appeared in the fourth episode of the show's seventh season, which was broadcast on Comedy Central on February 24, 1996. Michael J. Nelson, the show's head writer, spoke disparagingly about the film while describing it to the press: [...] "The plot is – and I'm not kidding here – the plot <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> is melting.

500|$|The {{film is a}} shot-for-shot {{adaptation}} of the comic book, similar to the film {{adaptation of}} Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. [...] "It was a fun process for me… to have a frame as a goal to get to," [...] he said. Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal [...] "Frank Miller world" [...] of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, {{he was able to}} introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that [...] "Dilios <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth." [...] Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Megadeth and its {{underground}} metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums {{from this period}} were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and [...] "snarling" [...] vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: [...] "When {{you go to a}} show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." [...] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.|$|E
500|$|The subplot of [...] "The Mansion Family", where Mr. Burns gets {{a medical}} examination, was {{inspired}} by Swartzwelder's own visit to a Mayo Clinic. George Meyer, an executive producer on the series, has said that [...] "John, I don't think <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who goes to the doctor very often. And every 20 or 30 years, he decides {{he needs to get}} a tune up. So he went to the Mayo Clinic, had them give him an entire battery of tests. And as John [...] tells it, they said that his constant smoking had done no harm to him whatsoever. Might even be benefiting him." [...] While writing the parts of the episode that involve international waters, the writers did research and found that the actual laws of international waters are more complex and ambiguous compared to what they had already written in the story, but they decided to ignore that.|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one.

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires.

500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> that can be either a hero or a terror.

500|$|Mulder's {{dream and}} {{decisions}} in [...] "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] heavily allude to {{the actions of}} Jesus in Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ. Duchovny, {{a fan of the}} book, found parallels between its central story and Mulder's ordeal, and incorporated many of the novel's concepts into the episode. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is torn between his higher calling as the son of God and his desire towards his own humanity. Duchovny was drawn to the fact that Christ's struggle in the novel was [...] "not only godlike, but also profoundly human" [...] and used this template for Mulder; in the series, Mulder is destined towards greater things—in this case, stopping the oncoming alien invasion—but he also desires to have a personal life. Duchovny noted that [...] "Mulder <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who's been given the same problem [...] What I'm doing is using the very human model of Christ". Duchovny cautioned that he was not trying to make Mulder into a Christ-like savior figure but rather [...] "an everyman". Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described the concept as a risk, but Duchovny felt that this exploration of Mulder's character was important to the series.|$|E
500|$|Williams' {{portrayal}} of the role was intended {{to act as a}} counterpoint to Jerry Hardin's {{portrayal of}} X's predecessor, Deep Throat. Whereas Deep Throat had been a selfless character, X was written and performed as a scared, selfish character. Prior to the episode [...] "One Breath", Glen Morgan had felt that the character of X was not [...] "going over too well" [...] with fans of the series, as he seemed to simply be a copy of Deep Throat. Believing Williams to be an actor worth having as a series regular, he included in the episode a scene in which X murders witnesses who have seen him speaking to Fox Mulder. Morgan felt that such a scene reflected X's paranoia and the difference between him and his predecessor, noting that [...] "Deep Throat was a guy willing to lose his life for letting out the secret, whereas X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who's still scared". [...] Williams has stated that he has never attempted to rationalize the character's motives or imagine a backstory for him, preferring to play the role with as little background as possible; he once stated [...] "the less I know about him, the more interesting he becomes." ...|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Bob Ringwood {{turned down}} {{the chance to work}} on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because [...] "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> with average build", he stated. [...] "The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature." [...] Burton commented, [...] "Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001.

My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing.

[...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar.

500|$|In the 2015–16 season, Laich's {{offensive}} production rapidly declined, {{while his}} $4.5 million cap hit stuck out {{as one of}} the only adverse aspects of a league-leading Capitals squad. On February 27, 2016, the Capitals placed Laich on waivers for the purpose of sending him to the Hershey Bears of the AHL. The following day, {{on the eve of the}} trade deadline, Laich, along with Connor Carrick and a second round selection (Carl Grundström) in the 2016 draft, were traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his boyhood team, in exchange for Daniel Winnik and a fifth round pick (Beck Malenstyn) in the 2016 draft. The purpose of the trade was to give the Capitals salary cap relief to use toward younger core player contracts that needed re-signing the following off-season. Capitals GM Brian Maclellan called the trade, when asked, the hardest thing he had done as General Manager of the team. [...] Laich had been the longest tenured active professional Washington-area athlete at the time of the trade, concluding his service of 12 years with the franchise. In what easily stands as the most emotional trade in Capitals history since Laich was dealt to Washington in a package for Peter Bondra, one journalist wrote [...] "It's ironic that money is what ultimately forced the Caps to move Laich.

On February 2, Crosby scored three {{straight}} goals for his first natural hat trick in more than five years. Four days later, Crosby scored his 900th, 901st and 902nd career NHL points to fuel a 3-2 overtime comeback victory over the Florida Panthers. He tallied at least one point in 15 of Pittsburgh's 16 games in March, including six multi-point efforts, and was subsequently named the NHL's First Star of the Month. On April 2, Crosby recorded his 600th NHL assist as the Penguins clinched their playoff berth. Six days later he scored in overtime against Washington Capitals to secure home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and 85 points in 80 games, including a career high nine game-winning goals, and was voted team MVP for the sixth time in his career. His two-way game also received league-wide praise, with Scotty Bowman stating that Crosby would be a good candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league's best defensive forward. Crosby's comeback also impressed Wayne Gretzky: [...] "He had a tough start, but the sign of an elite athlete <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> that battles through it. He didn't point any fingers, he just battled through it, and I don't think there is any question the last 40 or so games, he made a case for the MVP. He was that good. He went to another level."
