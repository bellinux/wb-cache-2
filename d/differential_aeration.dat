25|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} is a localized form of corrosion {{occurring in}} confined spaces (crevices), {{to which the}} access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. Formation of a <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a localized <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cell on metals, susceptible to both anodic and cathodic corrosion, is a serious threat because of multiple degradation processes commencing with the passivation layer destruction. By using local electrochemical and X-ray dispersive techniques, it has been demonstrated that the <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cell formed on high brass (-brass, Cu 65 -Zn 35) {{in the presence of}} 1 H-benzotriazole or 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole plays both corrosion-inhibiting and accelerating roles, depending on the inhibitor exposure time. Alternating-current scanning electrochemical microscopy was used to image local electrochemical activity, whereas energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided evidence for the mechanism of the observed phenomena. Short-term exposure to the inhibitor (5 min) promotes the {{formation of}} a passivation layer in the waterline region. In contrast, after prolonged exposure (45 min), a deficient passivation layer develops for both inhibitors. An excess of zinc(II) -inhibitor complexes in the passivation layer is accountable for the corrosion resistance of the region with high <b>differential</b> <b>aeration.</b> Rapid dezincification and local alkalinization facilitate the initial rapid {{formation of a}} passivation layer in the area under <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> to preserve its composition upon further modification...|$|E
40|$|Specially {{designed}} multilaminar electrochemical sensors (MS) {{are used}} to determine the difference in potential between the local anodes and cathodes of corrosion cells that form under protective organic coatings. These MS not only allow quantification of the effect of underfilm contamination and <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> on corrosion kinetics but also supply valuable information for {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion process mechanism. The use of MS with alternately clean and contaminated laminae clearly shows that differential contamination cells are capable of generating potential differences (driving forces) of hundreds of millivolt, as also occurred with underfilm <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cells. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|By {{analysing}} current-potential curves, it {{is shown}} that, conversely {{to what is}} generally thought, <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> does not intrinsically cause accelerated corrosion of metals. Based on this finding, a reason for this probably general misconception in the scientific literature is sought. Finally, a possible explanation for macroscopic corrosion phenomena that are known to occur under circumstances of local oxygen depletion is formulated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|A 2 -D axial {{symmetric}} time-dependant {{mathematical model}} {{was developed to}} investigate conditions for onset of under-deposit corrosion. A model for corrosion in fluids containing dissolved oxygen is presented. The presence of anodic and cathodic regions was not assumed a priori, but was rather the result of numerical simulations, which revealed galvanic coupling caused by the <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cells. In contrast to models presented in the literature, the conservation equation for each ionic species was employed in this work rather than Laplace’s equation. The model included coupled, nonlinear, convective diffusion equations for ionic species, which included the contribution of migration; local electroneutrality; homogeneous reactions; formation of primary precipitates; and anodic and cathodic reactions written explicitly in terms of local concentration and potential driving forces...|$|E
30|$|Conclusions may be {{extracted}} from studies {{carried out with}} particles of similar composition. The corrosion of zinc and steel has been studied in relation to the presence of deposited particles derived from the combustion of oil (which may be comparable to diesel fuel) and coal [139]. The authors concluded that in relatively unpolluted atmospheres inert particulates can induce corrosion in zinc and mild steel due to <b>differential</b> <b>aeration,</b> an effect which is masked when the overall corrosion rates increase. Oil-ash particles were also found to be much more corrosive than coal-ash particles. Although far from the heritage field in terms of temperature and concentration, some investigations have demonstrated that DPM leads to severe degradation of ceramic filters used in engine exhaust tubes [140].|$|E
40|$|External {{corrosion}} of buried {{carbon steel}} pipes {{is a problem}} of global proportions, affecting a wide range of industries and services. Many factors affect corrosion rates. Biofilms may secrete enzymes and compounds that attack metal, alter local acidity and create <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> and galvanic cells. An important consideration is that biofilm metabolisms and enzymatic reactions are constantly in flux, altering the impact of microorganisms on corrosion rates, and thermodynamic equilibrium is not reached. Recent research demonstrates that some anaerobic microorganisms catalyse the oxidation of metallic iron and directly consume the electrons, with serious consequences for corrosion. This review examines relationships between soil characteristics, microbiology and corrosion processes, focussing on the impacts of microorganisms on external corrosion of buried carbon steel pipes. Techniques for improving the understanding of microbially influenced corrosion are considered and critiqued, with the aim of assisting those who work in the area of corrosion mitigation.

40|$|A new {{mechanistic}} {{model has been}} established for the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms controlling nickel–aluminium bronze crevice corrosion. The crevice corrosion was initially confined to eutectoid regions with slight attack of the copper rich ?-phase within the ?+?III eutectoid. In the presence of high chloride concentrations, copper and aluminium complexes form and the hydrolysis of these complexes leads to the acidification of the crevice solution chemistry. As the crevice solution becomes increasingly acidic the initial protection of the ?-phases due to their higher aluminium contents is lost and become anodic to the ?-phase. The continuous nature of the ?III-phase makes it vulnerable with an 80 ?m depth of attack after only the first month which is accompanied by internal copper redeposited at cathodic sites. Crevice corrosion of copper-based alloys is often reported {{to be controlled by}} a copper-ion concentration cell, however, for nickel–aluminium bronze it appears that primarily the crevice corrosion propagation results from a combined action of localised acidification and <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> between the bold and occluded zones. This mechanistic understanding provides further insights in to the development of crevice corrosion experienced by nickel–aluminium bronze after long-term exposures to natural seawater for up to 3 years. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} communities {{associated with}} different corrosion deposit layers retrieved from a harbour steel structure affected by ALWC (Accelerated Low Water Corrosion) {{were determined by}} 16 S rDNA PCR-DGGE analysis. Comparative analysis of populations associated with ALWC layers and NLWC (Normal Low Water Corrosion) layers evidenced clear differences in the structure and composition of the communities. Dominant phylotypes related to sulphate-reducing bacteria pertaining to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were identified in both type of deposits (fraction of 52 % and 44 % of the total NLWC and ALWC communities, respectively). Phylotypes related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria were unique to ALWC deposits, while phylotypes related to oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria, diatoms) were only retrieved in NLWC deposits. This suggested that biologically-mediated sulphur cycle was the dominant process within ALWC deposits vs. chemically-mediated sulphur cycle within NLWC deposits. Since most of the members identified are heterotrophs, it is speculated that organic carbon may be available through water pollution and/or proliferation of photosynthetic biomass. Differences in oxygen concentration between ALWC and NLWC areas due to photosynthetic activities in NLWC {{may be an important}} factor contributing to the acceleration of corrosion by the mechanism of <b>differential</b> <b>aeration...</b>|$|E
40|$|Five {{freshwater}} {{marsh plant}} species exhibited different root metabolic responses when flooded to three water depths in field macrocosms. The capacity for alcoholic fermentation (as indicated by alcohol dehydrogenase activity) increased and remained {{at a relatively}} high level in {{the roots of the}} least flood-tolerant species, Scolochloa festucacea, but was not stimulated significantly or only temporarily in the more tolerant species, Scirpus acutus, Scirpus validus, Typha glauca, and Phragmites australis. During the first month of flooding, alcohol dehydrogenase activity showed a positive relationship with flooding depth and a negative relationship with soil redox potential. Malate accumulated in the roots of S. acutus, S. validus, {{and to a lesser extent}} in P. australis in response to flooding; concentrations showed a significant positive relationship with water depth and a significant negative relationship with soil redox potential during the first month of flooding. Differences in root metabolism among the five species were still evident after 1 year of continual flooding. Root specific gravities and air space cross-sectional volumes demonstrated potential species differences in root resistance to oxygen movement and root oxygen volume, respectively. The results suggest that the observed metabolic response reflected <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> of the roots resulting from differences in root structure and soil oxygen demand (reducing power) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for measuring localized corrosion under disbonded coatings {{by means of}} an electrochemical sensor, denoted <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> sensor (DAS). It measures the distribution of electrochemical currents over an electrode array surface partially covered by a crevice that simulates a disbonded coating. The DAS has been evaluated using immersion tests at open circuit and under cathodic protection (CP) conditions. Under both conditions, anodic as well as cathodic current densities were detected within the crevice. A fundamental understanding for the detection of anodic currents under CP has been explained in terms of basic electrochemistry. Based on the current distribution data provided by the sensor, two different analysis methods have been used to estimate corrosion and its distribution. These methods consisted of a direct application of Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Law to the anodic currents detected by the array, and on a sensor-specific method denoted corrected currents 2 ̆ 7 method. It has been demonstrated that under diffusion controlled conditions this latter method produces a better corrosion estimation than the direct application of Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Law. The corrected currents 2 ̆ 7 method allowed the estimation of corrosion patterns outside the crevice under CP. Good correlation between electrochemical calculations and surface profilometry results has been obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} loss of {{mild steel}} {{in the marine}} tidal zone varies considerably with elevation relative to mean tide. Classical studies on steel piles and electrically isolated coupons show quite different vertical corrosion profiles. This usually is attributed {{to the effect of}} <b>differential</b> <b>aeration.</b> In many practical applications, steel structures may be confined to just part of the tidal zone or may extend only partly into either the atmospheric zone or the immersion zone. This paper presents mass-loss profiles for steel strips of different lengths (0. 20, 0. 50, 1. 0, and 3 m) exposed at various elevations in the atmospheric, tidal, and immersion zones at Jervis Bay, Australia, where the tidal range is around 1. 2 m. Relatively little difference in the corrosion profile was observed in the corrosion profiles for 100 -mm-long coupons and for the shorter strips, mainly because each strip or coupon was confined to exposure only in a single zone. However, very high, localized corrosion was observed for a 1 -m strip with the lower end extending just into the immersion zone. The 3 -m-long strip and the individual coupons, all extending from the immersion zone to the atmospheric zone, displayed corrosion loss profiles generally consistent with those reported in classical studies...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{triggering}} factors affecting the service life and durability of structures. Several methods are used for corrosion studies but electrochemical techniques are the most commonly applied. Corrosion processes monitoring and control by means of non-destructive techniques, such as the implementation of embedded sensors, has been the target of many works.  It is possible to obtain relevant information of structural corrosion processes in real time. This document describes a system including specific equipment and which allows obtaining relevant information about these corrosion processes. This system is formed by a sensor network. There are several types of electrodes, which are distributed throughout the structure under study and a specific equipment developed by the research group, which is used to determine pertinent parameters such as the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and the corrosion density (icorr) by applying sequences of potentiostatic pulses. The system allows to reliably determine the corrosion rate in different areas of the structure. The sensor, due to its configuration, provides information of a specific area of the structure, but on the other hand it is involved in the galvanic events that can occur along the structure by <b>differential</b> <b>aeration,</b> galvanic cells, etc. because the sensor is not isolated from the structure.  This system also procures information of buried and submerged elements. Besides, it is possible to obtain information related to temperature, concrete resistance. The system includes specific potentiometric sensors to monitor chloride access and carbonatation processes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} involved in both microbiologically influenced corrosion and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures by algae are explained. In this regards, the five possible corrosion/deterioration mechanisms {{that may be}} expected are addressed and described. These mechanisms are as follows: Absorption of some chemicals necessary for the algae from within the cement paste of the concrete: this mechanism can finally result in drying out the concrete and developing cracks {{as a result of}} formation of internal cavities and voids. Biofilm formation and increasing the likelihood of attracting more micro-/macroorganisms that can either deteriorate the concrete itself or the reinforcement steel inside, or both. An example as such can be development of an environment favorable for the acid-producing sulphur oxidizing bacteria that through generating very acidic conditions are capable of doing harm to both metallic and non-metallic phases of the reinforced concrete. Development of electrochemical cells such as <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cells due to the photosynthetic driven oxygen production and consumption features of algae. In this way, it is likely that spots of varying oxygen partial pressures will be created, tus facilitating the corrosion of the steel inside. Production of acids that can be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of both concrete and steel reinforcement. Production of alkaline conditions that upon varying and fluctuating due to the chemistry of the system, can protect the concrete but do damage to the steel phase via mechanisms such as caustic embrittlement. The aim of this review paper is to gather all possible mechanisms that may be involved in explaining the contribution of algae to the bio-corrosion/bio-deterioration of reinforced concrete...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2016. Major: Biological Science. Advisor: Randall Hicks. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 49 pages. Corrosion of steel {{structures in the}} Duluth-Superior Harbor (DSH) is a severe economic problem. This corrosion is characterized by deep pits covered by crusty, orange, blister-like structures called tubercles. Prior research demonstrated these tubercles contain both iron-oxidizing (IOB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) but fine scale changes of bacterial community structure within these tubercles remain unknown. Experimental steel coupons were placed at four sites in the DSH in 2006 and 2012 and recovered in 2013 to measure chemical gradients and identify bacteria associated with young and old corrosion tubercles. Oxygen concentrations measured with microelectrodes decreased from saturation in the overlying water to nearly anoxic conditions at the surface of tubercles while ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) concentration increased with depth inside the tubercles. Bacterial DNA from {{different regions of the}} tubercles was sequenced using a next-generation sequencing technique to characterize the bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition changed within the tubercles. Families containing bacteria that oxidize iron and sulfur were consistently found on the outsides of tubercles and on non-tubercle steel. Families with bacteria that reduce iron and sulfur were found on the undersides of tubercles and in corrosion pits on the steel surface. Iron-oxidizing bacteria were more abundant after 0. 8 years than 6. 6 years and were distributed throughout tubercles while sulfate-reducing bacteria were most abundant in corrosion pits. Combined, these data are consistent with the cathodic depolarization (<b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> cell model) and direct electron transfer theories of pitting corrosion, which provide explanations for the roles of bacteria in the accelerated corrosion of steel structures...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} {{is to examine the}} rivetability of new steels and to {{investigate}} the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted (SPR) aluminium-steel hybrid structures for automotive applications. Interstitial Free Steel (I. F.) of 1. 2 mm thickness was joined to Aluminium 5754 of 2 mm thickness and Aluminium 5182 (coated and uncoated) of 1. 5 mm thickness. The work began by initially conducting a quality assessment of the various joints that were produced in order to establish the optimum conditions for joining the various sample combinations to be investigated. A relationship was established between the head height and the interlock distance {{on the one hand and}} between the interlock distance and the lap shear strength of samples. It was also established that for higher lap shear strength, it is preferable to use the stronger material (I. F. steel) as the pierced sheet and the weaker material (5182) as the locked sheet. However, the results showed that this rule could not be applied for predicting the fatigue behaviour of SPR joints between I. F. steel and 5182. An investigation of the fatigue failure mechanisms was undertaken and possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed. The influence of fretting was also investigated by using scanning electron microscopy and reported. The fatigue behaviour of Dual Phase (DP 600 + 5182) SPR joints was investigated. It was observed that the position of fatigue crack initiation differed with the maximum applied load. An explanation for this observation was provided by considering the failure mechanism of the samples under different load levels. The study also showed how fretting led to the initiation of fatigue cracks. The corrosion behaviour of (I. F. steel + 5182) samples was investigated by conducting tests in a salt spray according to the ASTM B 117 - 97 standard. Three types of corrosion were observed; galvanic corrosion, <b>differential</b> <b>aeration</b> corrosion, uniform corrosion and are discussed. The weight change with time was monitored and was used to describe the corrosion behaviour. The lap shear strength was measured as a function of corrosion time. The presence of the corrosion product within the overlap was observed to greatly influence the lap shear strength behaviour. A further study was carried out in order to examine the influence of the individual alloys on the corrosion of the SPR samples. In this part the potential influence of pulse current treatment on corrosion was also investigated and was observed to increase greatly the corrosion resistance of the I. F. steel. Principal findings for this observation are also provided. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
