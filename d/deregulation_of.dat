5|$|According to Jim Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H. Jones Center for Economic and Demographic Forecasting at Rice Center, a Rice University-affiliated urban research center, {{the development of these}} apartment complexes was not well planned or coordinated. There was often little interest in building a quality product as developers were primarily concerned with generating quick revenue and capitalizing on the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> financial institutions, tax laws favoring apartment construction, inflation, and a housing shortage in the Houston metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Eurotunnel (the {{owners of}} the Channel Tunnel) {{announced}} that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock. Under the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to access by other operators on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) {{announced that it was}} considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> {{the market in}} 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu {{made it impossible to}} have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> {{the airline}} market in 1994, which allowed any European Economic Area-airline to operate any route they wished, Teddy Air tried to start {{services}} at Moss Airport, Rygge. Since {{it at the}} time was the military-only Rygge Air Station, with no passenger facilities, the airline was not successful in receiving permission. However, it did choose to start competing with Air Stord on the Skien–Bergen route, starting 8May 1995. Using its Embraer 110 aircraft, it launched tickets for under NOK1000, compared with the NOK1290 price offered by Air Stord. The latter had aircraft half the size, but offered 31 flights per week, compared to the 16 offered by Teddy Air. In addition, Coast Air launched two weekly round trips. The routes were mainly used by commuters working on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. By 1995, 60 percent of the airline had been bought by Hermann Løvenskiold.|$|E
5|$|Teddy Air AS was a {{regional}} airline, based at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, in Norway. Operating between 1989 and 2004, the company operated Britten-Norman Islander, Embraer 110 and Saab 340 aircraft. The company started {{by providing a}} scheduled service between Skien and Oslo in 1990, followed by services to Stavanger in 1993 and Bergen in 1994. In 1996, it won {{a contract with the}} Ministry of Transport from Oslo to Fagernes. It was involved in intense competition with other regional airlines, notably Coast Air and Guard Air, following the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the aviation market. It also had a single international service to Gothenburg, and from 1999 it served Stord Airport, Sørstokken. From 1999, the company was transformed to a virtual airline, which wet leased aircraft from Golden Air. The company ceased operations in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Tramway had a {{ridership}} of 108 million {{passengers in}} 1948. On 17 January 1949, the Korsvoll Line {{became the first}} tram line to be closed. followed by the Rodeløkka Line on 6 February. The latter reopened following a new route on 2 January 1955. In 1960, with the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks. Tracks would be kept and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would {{be made in the}} lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodeløkka, Vippetangen, Simensbråten and Vestbanen Lines were closed, as were trolleybus lines 18 and 24. The remaining two trolleybus routes were closed in 1968. On 24 June 1968, Vålerenga Line was closed.|$|E

5|$|The company {{changed its}} name to Tillingbourne Bus Company in 1972, {{changing}} its livery to blue and yellow, and moved to a garage in Gomshall in the same year. A second garage in Ewhurst was opened in 1974. An expansion of operations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, much of it through the award of county council contracted routes, took the company's vehicles into West Sussex and Hampshire as well as Surrey. Tillingbourne took over the services of London operator Orpington & District following that company's collapse in 1981. These were run separately from the main company as Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) which, in 1983, was sold to its management to form Metrobus, now part of the Go-Ahead Group. The company moved garages again in 1980, settling in Cranleigh. A new, larger garage in the same town was opened in February 2001. <b>Deregulation</b> <b>of</b> local bus services in 1986 led to further expansion, including the establishment in 1989 of a new brand, Hobbit, for Tillingbourne's minibus operations. A high-quality coaching subsidiary, Dorking Coaches, was also operated towards the end of Tillingbourne's life.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E

40|$|What {{determines the}} {{enforcement}} <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> reform <b>of</b> business activities? What are the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>deregulation?</b> We address these questions using {{an episode of}} a drastic reform in Russia between 2001 and 2004 which liberalized registration, licensing, and inspections. Based on the analysis of micro-level panel data on regulatory burden, we find that: 1) On average, the reform reduced the administrative costs of firms; but, the progress of reform had a substantial geographical variation. 2) The enforcement <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> reform was better in regions with a transparent government, low corruption, better access of the public to independent media sources, a powerful industrial lobby, and stronger fiscal autonomy. 3) Using the exogenous variation in regulation generated by the interaction of reform and its institutional determinants, we find a substantial positive effect <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> on net entry and small business employment and no effect on pollution and public health. The results support public choice theory {{of the nature of}} regulation and are inconsistent with the predictions of public interest theory. ...|$|R

It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful deregulation legislation, the Airline Deregulation Act, was cleared by Congress. Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980, with the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> railroads and trucking. <b>Deregulation</b> <b>of</b> interstate buses followed in 1982. In addition to transportation deregulation, savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in 1980 and the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982.|$|E

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that the enhanced product market competition <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> reduces employers' ability to discriminate when hiring. Recent studies of the effect <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> on racial employment in the naturally competitive trucking industry find that deregulation increased minority employment. This study examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> on racial employment in the airline industry. Because deregulation transformed airlines from wasteful service competition to rigorous price competition, deregulation's effect on racial hiring in this continuously competitive industry is not apparent. This study finds that deregulation only modestly changed the racial composition of major airline occupations, {{which suggests that the}} change in market structure as a result <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> may largely determine the effect of regulatory reform on the racial composition of an industry. © 2001 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
