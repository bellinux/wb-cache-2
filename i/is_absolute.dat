Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses <b>is</b> <b>absolute.</b> Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E

The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration <b>is</b> <b>absolute.</b> (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.|$|E
25|$|The lowest {{theoretical}} temperature <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> zero, {{at which}} the thermal motion of all fundamental particles in matter reaches a minimum. Although classically described as motionless, particles still possess a finite zero-point energy in the quantum mechanical description.

25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> substance only insofar as he <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E

25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} has {{two fundamental}} types of measurements: angle and distance. The angle scale <b>is</b> <b>absolute,</b> and Euclid uses the right angle as his basic unit, so that, e.g., a 45-degree angle would {{be referred to}} as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.|$|E
25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Stafford Betty, {{teacher for}} Religious Studies at California State University, Bakersfield finds common ground between Tolle's worldview {{and that of}} Christian mystics. He notes that [...] "one of the key {{elements}} in Tolle's teaching is that deep within the mind <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> stillness in which one can experience 'the joy of Being'". Roman Catholic priest and theologian Richard Rohr credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians: [...] "Tolle is, in fact, rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition ... both {{the ground and the}} process for breaking through to the theological contemplation of God, and acquired contemplation of Jesus, the Gospels, and all spiritual things." ...|$|E
500|$|Portal {{received}} critical acclaim, often {{earning more}} praise than either Half-Life 2: Episode Two or Team Fortress 2, two titles {{also included in}} The Orange Box. It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that [...] "the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story <b>is</b> <b>absolute</b> genius", while GameSpy noted that [...] "What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration." [...] The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.|$|E
500|$|... "Freedom of {{religion}} means freedom {{to hold an}} opinion or belief, but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order." [...] In Reynolds v. United States (1878), the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions, laws {{can be made to}} regulate some religious practices (e.g., human sacrifices, and the Hindu practice of suttee). The Court stated that to rule otherwise, [...] "would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government would exist only in name under such circumstances." [...] In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states. While the right to have religious beliefs <b>is</b> <b>absolute,</b> the freedom to act on such beliefs is not absolute.|$|E

[...] In a letter to Aino from August 1894, Sibelius claimed to be [...] "really a tone painter and poet" [...] in the mold of the symphonic poems of Liszt. In The Wood Nymph, Sibelius adheres closely to the narrative structure of Rydberg's poem, so much so that at the 1895 premiere, audience members were provided with copies of the source material, indicating the centrality of Rydberg's plot to the performance. Due to its programmatic qualities, musicologists commonly describe The Wood Nymph, although in one movement, as consisting of four informal sections or [...] "dramatic tableaux", each of which corresponds to one of the poem's four stanzas: ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the betting scandal, Stern revised the {{guidelines}} on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with sportsbooks. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that [...] " [...] ban on gambling <b>is</b> <b>absolute,</b> and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting—though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling [...] on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.|$|E
