The singer quotes him as saying: [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> album. It's just so out there." [...] They told the producer that they had previously been signed to RCA. In one 1989 interview with Classic Rock magazine, Steinman labeled him [...] "the only genuine genius I've ever worked with." [...] In a 1989 interview with Redbeard for the In the Studio with Redbeard episode on the making of the album, Meat Loaf revealed that Jimmy Iovine and Andy Johns were potential candidates for producing Bat Out of Hell before being rejected by Meat and Steinman in favor of Rundgren, who Meat initially found cocky but grew to like.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{announced}} in January 2010 that actor Peter Weller had been {{cast in a}} guest starring role for an upcoming episode. Though he had normally kept his distance from episodic television because it [...] "burns [...] out" [...] and he was pursuing a Ph.D at UCLA, his wife, a big Fringe fan, read the script and convinced him to accept the part of Alistair Peck, telling him [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> it's beautiful, it's {{about a guy who}} wants to save his wife". During a conference call with journalists, Weller also cited the character's [...] "tremendously romantic and very moving" [...] storyline as another reason he accepted the part. He thought the four-page scripted scene between him and John Noble was [...] "rare for television [...] wonderfully written. I was thrilled to do [...] ". Weller has since become a fan of Fringe because of his work in the episode, and would love to return and direct for the show. In a later Twitter post, Wyman dismissed speculation and confirmed that Weller's character Alistair Peck did indeed die {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." [...] In one interview following the race, Čavić said [...] "I am completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed that he expects that [...] "people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.|$|E

500|$|According to McEntire, Clarkson was {{the first}} singer to pair up with her for the album [...] (2007). She also claimed that [...] "Because of You" [...] was not the {{original}} song {{to be included in}} the album; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson, titled [...] "A Lot Like You." [...] McEntire explained that it was Narvel, her husband, who convinced her to go back in the studio and record [...] "Because of You" [...] after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song. She expressed, [...] "Narvel saw it. That wasn't one of the songs we had talked about recording – matter of fact, Kelly and I had already recorded a song, 'A Lot Like You,' for the duet project, and he said, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> one together,' so we did." [...] Musically, the song is different from the original version. Thom Jhurek of Allmusic described the duet version as [...] "a big, overblown power ballad" [...] which incorporates [...] "guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals." [...] The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet, giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed [...] "unnecessary" [...] by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics. The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15, 2007, as the lead single from the album. It was added to country radio playlists on May 28, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{convinced}} Fox {{to promote}} the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the Titanic wreck itself, and organized several dives to the site {{over a period of}} two years. [...] "My pitch on that had {{to be a little more}} detailed," [...] said Cameron. [...] "So I said, 'Look, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> whole opening where they're exploring the Titanic and they find the diamond, so we're going to have all these shots of the ship." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "Now, we can either do them with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck." [...] The crew shot at the real wreck in the Atlantic Ocean twelve times in 1995 and actually spent more time with the ship than its passengers. At that depth, with a water pressure of 6,000 pounds per square inch, [...] "one small flaw in the vessel's superstructure would mean instant death for all on board." [...] Not only were the dives high-risk, but adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting the high quality footage that he wanted. During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with Titanics hull, damaging both sub and ship and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of Captain Smith's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior. The area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was also damaged.|$|E

2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track.

[...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
