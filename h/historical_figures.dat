5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} saints and <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> have {{followed}} and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian <b>historical</b> <b>figures</b> (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of <b>historical</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E

5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. <b>Historical</b> <b>figures</b> like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
5|$|He {{supported}} {{the development of}} the sciences, particularly cartography; he hired a personal cartographer (Karol de Perthees) even before his election as king.

At the Royal Castle in Warsaw, he organized an astronomical observatory and supported astronomers Jan Śniadecki and Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt. He also sponsored historical studies, including the collection, cataloging and copying of historical manuscripts. He encouraged publications of biographies of famous Polish <b>historical</b> <b>figures,</b> and sponsored their paintings and sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the <b>historical</b> <b>figures,</b> voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E

A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the <b>historical</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of all Serbian epic or <b>historical</b> <b>figures,</b> Marko is {{considered}} to have given the most inspiration to visual artists; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors. His oldest known depictions are 14th-century frescoes from Marko's Monastery and Prilep. An 18th-century drawing of Marko {{is found in the}} Čajniče Gospels, a medieval parchment manuscript belonging to a Serbian Orthodox church in Čajniče in eastern Bosnia. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint and reminiscent of stećci reliefs. Vuk Karadžić wrote that during his late-18th-century childhood he saw a painting of Marko carrying an ox on his back.|$|E
