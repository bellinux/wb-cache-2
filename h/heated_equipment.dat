40|$|Gamma-radiation is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} analysis and characterization signal to monitor material in the nuclear fuel processing cycle. The selection as a diagnostic is self-evident since the radiation is ubiquitous, characteristic of the isotopes present, and sufficiently penetrating so that measurements may be made remotely. However, save through detector proximity or minimal collimation, the directional nature of the radiation is generally not used in traditional nondestructive assay (NDA) measurements. To demonstrate the additional information available, we used GRIS, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Spectrometer, at the K- 25 and Portsmouth gaseous diffusion plants. In this facility, UF{sub 6 } gas is enriched in <b>heated</b> <b>equipment</b> and piping which run inside an insulated housing. Occasionally, the process develops uranium deposits due to leakage of wet air or environmental changes within the housing that cause solidification of the process gas. When such deposits occur, traditional NDA techniques frequently require costly and time-consuming entry within the heat shielding to obtain precise information on the deposit unavailable from outside the shielding. In this paper we discuss GRIS, the gamma-ray imaging technique it uses, and present the results of measurements obtained on fuel processing equipment...|$|E

40|$|Waste acid streams {{produced}} at industrial sites are often co-located with large sources of waste heat (e. g., industrial exhaust gases, cooling water, and <b>heated</b> <b>equipment).</b> Reverse electrodialysis (RED) {{systems can be}} used to generate electrical power and hydrogen gas using waste heat-derived solutions, but high electrode overpotentials limit system performance. We show here that an ammonium bicarbonate (AmB) RED system can achieve simultaneous waste acid neutralization and in situ hydrogen production, while capturing energy from excess waste heat. The rate of acid neutralization was dependent on stack flow rate and increased 50 × (from 0. 06 ± 0. 04 to 3. 0 ± 0. 32 pH units min - 1 m- 2 membrane), as the flow rate increased 6 × (from 100 to 600 mL min- 1). Acid neutralization primarily took place due to ammonium electromigration (37 ± 4 %) and proton diffusion (60 ± 5 %). The use of a synthetic waste acid stream as a catholyte (pH ≈ 2) also increased hydrogen production rates by 65 % (from 5. 3 ± 0. 5 to 8. 7 ± 0. 1 m 3 H 2 m- 3 catholyte day - 1) compared to an AmB electrolyte (pH ≈ 8. 5). These findings highlight the potential use of dissimilar electrolytes (e. g., basic anolyte and acidic catholyte) for enhanced power and hydrogen production in RED stacks. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Condensing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> are 10 - 30 percent more energy-efficient than conventional space and water heating. Currently, condensing gas furnaces represent 40 percent of shipments and are common in the Northern U. S. market. Meanwhile, manufacturers are planning to develop condensing gas storage water heaters to qualify for Energy Star? certification. Consumers, installers, and builders who make decisions about installing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> generally do not perform an analysis to assess the economic impacts of different combinations and efficiencies of space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment.</b> Thus, equipment is often installed without taking into consideration the potential life-cycle economic and energy savings of installing space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> combinations. Drawing on previous and current analysis conducted for the United States Department of Energy rulemaking on amended standards for furnaces and water heaters, this paper evaluates {{the extent to which}} condensing equipment can provide life-cycle cost-effectiveness in a representative sample of single family American homes. The economic analyses indicate that significant energy savings and consumer benefits may result from large-scale introduction of condensing water heaters combined with condensing furnaces in U.

The analyses also shows that important benefits may be overlooked when policy analysts evaluate the impact of space and water <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> separately...|$|R

40|$|A novel circuit {{topology}} of modified switched boost {{high frequency}} hybrid resonant inverter fitted induction <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is presented in}} this paper for efficient induction heating. Recently, induction heating technique is becoming very popular for both domestic and industrial purposes because of its high energy efficiency and controllability. Generally in induction heating, a high frequency alternating magnetic field is required to induce the eddy currents in the work piece. High frequency resonant inverters are incorporated in induction <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> which produce a high frequency alternating magnetic field surrounding the coil. Previously this high frequency alternating magnetic field was produced by voltage source inverters. But VSIs have several demerits.

40|$|The {{heat losses}} from the {{envelope}} {{surface of a}} U. S. Navy K-type airship are evaluated {{to determine if the}} use of heat is a feasible means of preventing ice and snow accumulations on lighter-than-air craft during flight and when moored uncovered. Consideration is given to heat losses in clear air (no liquid water present in the atmosphere) and in probable conditions of icing and snow. The results of the analysis indicate that the amount of heat required in flight to raise the surface temperature of the entire envelope to the extent considered adequate for ice protection, based on experience with tests of heavier-than-air craft, is very large. Existing types of <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> which could be used to supply this quantity of heat would probably be too bulky and heavy to provide a practical flight installation. The heat requirements to provide protection for the nose and stern regions in assumed mild to moderate icing conditions appear to be within the range of the capacity of current types of <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> suitable for flight use. The amount of heat necessary to prevent snow accumulations on the upper surface of the airship envelope when moored uncovered under all conditions appear to be excessive for the <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> presently available for flight use, but could possibly be achieved with auxiliary ground <b>heating</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R

In this study, a workflow is developed, applied and validated to characterize the IR <b>heating</b> <b>equipment</b> and to determine the optimal heating strategy. The workflow starts with an on site equipment/machine characterization, which takes all machine and environment parameters into account. This approach results in the optimal heater setting and heating duration in order to obtain a through thickness temperature distribution which lies within a predefined forming range. The proposed methodology is universally applicable as it can deal with different types of sheet material and thicknesses. Moreover it can be applied to any type of IR heating element (halogen, metal foil, ceramic or quartz). Moreover, the methodology can easily be implemented in an industrial environment. Additionally, an estimate for the thermal efficiency of halogen heater equipment can be determined. status: publishe...|$|R
