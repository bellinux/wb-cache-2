There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics.

5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely.
