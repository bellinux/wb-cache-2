40|$|International audienceNew density {{data for}} <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA) over 12 isotherms [(293. 15 < T < 403. 15) K] and 15 isobars [(0. 1 < p < 140) MPa] are reported. This paper {{presents}} also the calibration procedure we propose {{for a new}} experimental equipment. Data reliability has been verified over the pressure and temperature experimental intervals by comparing our experimental results for toluene and 1 -butanol with previous literature data. A total of 732 experimental data points have been measured {{in the framework of}} this work. The experimental uncertainty is estimated to be ± 0. 5 kg · m- 3 (around 0. 05 %). The pressure and temperature dependencies of <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> densities were accurately represented by the Tammann-Tait equation with standard deviations of 0. 3 kg · m- 3.

40|$|Abstract Blends of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) plasticized with adipate esters (diisodecyl adipate and <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate)</b> having different {{molecular weight}} {{were used to}} produce sheets. The calendering-extrusion process at a pilot scale was used, and the mechanical, barrier, and morphological characterization of the obtained materials were performed. The increase in the TPS content affected the mechanical properties of the sheets by increasing the elongation and decreasing the rigidity. TPS conferred a more hydrophilic character to the sheets, as observed from the water vapor permeability results. The sheets plasticized with diisodecyl adipate (DIA), having a higher molecular weight, had better mechanical and barrier properties than <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA) plasticized sheets, indicating that DIA was more effective as plasticizer. Micrographs obtained by confocal laser microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed different morphologies when different proportions of PLA and TPS were used (dispersed or co-continuous structures), which were strongly associated with the mechanical and barrier properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{study was conducted}} on the optimal steady state operation of a jacketed, tubular, liquid-phase reactor in which consecutive second-order reactions occurred in turbulent flow. To verify the proposed mathematical model, <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> was saponified with sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution. The 150 ft. long reactor jacket was divided into 5, 30 ft. sections. Hot water flow rates in the jacket sections were chosen to maximize the concentration of monoethyl adipate ion at the reactor exit. The plug-flow model and a position-dependent heat transfer coefficient accurately described temperature and concentration profiles. The Pontryagin maximum principle was used to choose idealized reactor temperature and wall heat flux profiles which would maximize the exit concentration of monoester. The maximum principle was shown to be an effective tool for this type of reactor optimization. A technique is given for optimizing more complex reaction systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper reports new {{measurements}} of the density of dimethyl adipate (DMA) and diisobutyl adipate (DiBA) over 12 isotherms from (293. 15 to 403. 15) K and 15 isobars from (0. 1 to 140) MPa. The density of <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA) in the same conditions has already been published in a previous work. Viscosity data for the three fluids are also presented from (283. 15 to 373. 15) K at 0. 1 MPa. The influence {{of the size of}} the adipate chains on the thermophysical properties has been analyzed. The correlation of the densities against pressure and temperature with the Tammann-Tait equation were used to obtain the isothermal compressibility and the isobaric thermal expansivity. The linear dependence between the tangent bulk modulus at atmospheric pressure and the secant bulk modulus at 100 MPa recently proposed by Kiselev et al. is also used in this work to calculate the isothermal compressibility at atmospheric pressure...|$|E
40|$|Aliphatic polyesters are {{of great}} {{interest}} due to their broad potential applications and sustainability. Itaconate-based aliphatic polyesters are even more appealing in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields, as they are renewable functional polymers that can be biodegradable, biocompatible, and photo-curable, and might be bioresorbable. Herein, various biobased saturated aliphatic polyesters and itaconate-based un-saturated aliphatic polyesters are successfully produced via Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) -catalyzed polycondensation of (potentially) biobased dimethyl itaconate, 1, 4 -butanediol and various diacid ethyl esters, using a two-stage method in diphenyl ether. The synthetic aliphatic polyesters reach high (M-w) over bar (weight average molecular weight) values up to 94 kg mol(- 1). Studies {{on the effect of}} diacid ethyl esters on the enzymatic polymerization reveal that CALB prefers diacid ethyl esters having a chain length of more than 2 (n > 2, n is the number of methylene groups between the two carbonyl groups); and CALB shows the highest specificity for <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> among the tested diacid ethyl esters (n = 2 - 10). Moreover, the structure-property relationships are discussed by investigating the chemical structures, crystalline properties and thermal properties of the obtained aliphatic polyesters, as well as, the thermal transitions and mechanical properties of the UV cross-linked unsaturated polyesters...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on a four-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine {{operating}} on Euro V diesel fuel blended with <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA). The blended fuels contain 8. 1 %, 16. 4 %, 25 % and 33. 8 % by volume fraction of DEA, corresponding to 3 %, 6 %, 9 % and 12 % by mass of oxygen in the blends. The engine performance and exhaust gas emissions of the different fuels were investigated at five engine loads at a steady speed of 1800 rev/min. The results indicated an increase of brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency when the engine was fueled with the blended fuels. In comparison with diesel fuel, the blended fuels resulted {{in an increase in}} hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO), but a decrease in particulate mass concentrations. The nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission experienced a slight variation among the test fuels. In regard to the unregulated gaseous emissions, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde increased, while 1, 3 -butadiene, ethene, ethyne, propylene and BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene) in general decreased. A diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) was found to reduce significantly most of the investigated unregulated pollutants when the exhaust gas temperature was sufficiently high.

40|$|Euro V {{diesel fuel}} blended with 8. 1 %, 16. 4 %, 25 % and 33. 8 % by volume of <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA), {{corresponding}} to 3 %, 6 %, 9 % and 12 % by mass of {{oxygen in the}} blended fuels, were tested on a 4 -cylinder direct-injection diesel engine. Experiments were conducted under five engine loads at a steady speed of 1800. rev/min to investigate {{the effects of the}} blended fuels on combustion and particulate emission characteristics. The results indicate an increase in ignition delay and the amount of heat release in the premixed burning phase, while a decrease in both diffusive and total combustion duration with an increase in DEA in the fuel. Compared to the diesel fuel, the particulate mass concentration and the total number of particles are reduced significantly, whereas the proportion of soluble organic fraction (SOF) in the particles increases with increasing DEA in the fuel. The increase in SOF might increase the toxicity of the particles. Moreover, the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles shifts towards smaller size. A diesel oxidation catalyst was used and found to further reduce both particulate mass and total number concentration. The results also show that the DOC could reduce the finer particles more effectively. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|A {{correlation}} and predictive {{scheme for}} the viscosity and self-diffusivity of liquid dialkyl adipates is presented. The scheme {{is based on}} the kinetic theory for dense hard-sphere fluids, applied to the van der Waals model of a liquid to predict the transport properties. A "universal" curve for a dimensionless viscosity of dialkyl adipates was obtained using recently published experimental viscosity and density data of compressed liquid dimethyl (DMA), dipropyl (DPA), and dibutyl (DBA) adipates. The experimental data are described by the correlation scheme with a root-mean-square deviation of +/- 0. 34 %. The parameters describing the temperature dependence of the characteristic volume, V- 0, and the roughness parameter, R-eta, for each adipate are well correlated with one single molecular parameter. Recently published experimental self-diffusion coefficients of the same set of liquid dialkyl adipates at atmospheric pressure were correlated using the characteristic volumes obtained from the viscosity data. The roughness factors, R-D, are well correlated with the same single molecular parameter found for viscosity. The root-mean-square deviation of the data from the correlation is less than 1. 07 %. Tests are presented in order to assess the capability of the correlation scheme to estimate the viscosity of compressed liquid <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA) in a range of temperatures and pressures by comparison with literature data and of its self-diffusivity at atmospheric pressure in a range of temperatures. It is noteworthy that no data for DEA were used to build the correlation scheme. The deviations encountered between predicted and experimental data for the viscosity and self-diffusivity do not exceed 2. 0 % and 2. 2 %, respectively, which are commensurate with the estimated experimental measurement uncertainty, in both cases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntroduction Modern {{lubricants}} {{are complex}} formulations, which are continually developed to meet increasing requirements for performance and durability [1]. In {{the scope of}} the investigation of more benign lubricants, as potential replacements of oils currently used, we have focused our attention on the diesters (adipates), which have excellent properties for industrial applications. Diesters are obtained by reacting a linear or branched diacid, with a monofunctional alcohol. In the case of adipates, 1, 6 -hexanoic diacid, also named adipic acid, is used. In the present work dimethyl adipate (DMA), <b>diethyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DEA) and diisobutyl adipate (DiBA) have been studied over wide pressure and temperature intervals. The analysis of the effect of the molecular size is performed in terms of volumetric properties (density, isothermal compressibility and thermal isobaric expansivity), together with viscosity and viscosity index. Experimental The density  as a function of pressure and temperature was measured with a high pressure vibrating tube densimeter Anton Paar DMA HPM which is adequate to perform measurements up to 140 MPa. The calibration of this equipment has been performed with vacuum, water and decane [2]. Viscosity at atmospheric pressure was measured with a rotational automated viscometer Anton Paar Stabinger SVM 3000. We have verified the viscosity uncertainty of this viscometer with two Canon reference fluids S 60 and N 100, finding that the deviations are lower than 1 %. Results and Discussion Density measurements have been performed from 293. 15 to 403. 15 K and up to 140 MPa. The experimental density values have been correlated successfully using a Tait-type equation. In Figure 1 it can be seen the molecular structure of dialkyl adipates and the density behavior. At fixed temperature and pressure, density follows the trend DMA > DEA > DiBA. So, it decreases with the molecular size (molar weight or number of carbon atoms). The behavior of the isothermal compressibility for two temperatures can be also seen in Figure 1. This property decreases with pressure and increases with temperature for the three adipates. Furthermore, an increase on T occurs when the molecular size of the molecule increases. Similar behavior has been previously found for other fluids such as pentaerythritol ester lubricants [3]. The effect of changing the temperature or the pressure has more impact on the values of the isothermal compressibility than on the isobaric thermal expansivity...|$|E
