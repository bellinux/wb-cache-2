5|$|June 22, 1972- Tropical Storm Agnes {{passes to}} the east of the state, {{dropping}} moderate amounts of rainfall of up to 7.6inches (193mm) in Middletown and causing <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> tides. The storm causes light damage and 1 death in Delaware.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died {{shortly before}} a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a {{pharmacy}} {{released a statement}} explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose {{of one of the}} ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly compounded by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> in the blood samples, and 15 to 20 times <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> in the liver samples. Selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor.|$|E
5|$|The producers/distributors {{exercised}} a <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> {{level of}} control over their work. There was a limited release, {{a new form of}} television publicity, safeguards against video piracy, and a delay in the releasing of video tapes.|$|E

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|August 24, 1933- After making {{landfall}} on the Outer Banks, the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac hurricane {{passes through}} Virginia and Maryland. <b>Higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> tides washes out about 1square mile (2.6km²) of beaches along the Delaware coastline, while strong winds cause $150,000 in damage (1933USD, $2.5million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> levels of bacteria {{at the mouth}} of Carancahua Creek and alkaline pH levels, symptomatic of algal bloom. The issues discovered by the Commission were common in the water bodies examined for the study, and they noted that such issues would be addressed.|$|E

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E
5|$|In September 1953, about 650 people {{attended}} the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house {{are allowed to}} see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas. More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is {{about half of the}} total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E

50|$|The {{expanded}} clay is very consistent {{and is more}} resistant at <b>high</b> temperatures <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> aggregates, and it has higher water absorption. It has a high content of aluminium, silica, oxygen and iron.|$|R
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (<b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Tropical Storm Danielle and a ridge of high pressure to its north produced moderately strong winds across eastern North Carolina, peaking at 58mph (93km/h) at Alligator River Bridge. Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds. The {{pressure gradient}} also produced <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> waves along the coastline, {{with a maximum}} of 20feet (6m) at Duck. Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped only light rainfall, totaling to 0.2inches (5mm) at Cape Hatteras. However, locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1inch (25mm) of rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} {{throughout its}} path, and winds were minimal. The combination of Danielle {{and a high}} pressure system produced <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking, and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was minimal.|$|E

5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal</b> proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's death {{triggered}} a global outpouring of grief. The news spread quickly online, causing websites {{to slow down}} and crash from user overload, and putting unprecedented strain on services and websites including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Overall, web traffic ranged from 11% to at least 20% <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal.</b> MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos. Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, airing hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>normal.</b> Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
25|$|During {{the acute}} {{stage of the}} infection, the liver enzyme alanine {{transferase}} (ALT) {{is present in the}} blood at levels much <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> is <b>normal.</b> The enzyme comes from the liver cells damaged by the virus.|$|R
