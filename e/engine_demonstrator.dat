40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to determine a wave rotor <b>demonstrator</b> <b>engine</b> concept using the Allison 250 series engine. The results of the NASA LERC wave rotor effort were used as a basis for the wave rotor design. A wave rotor topped gas turbine engine was identified which incorporates five basic requirements of a successful <b>demonstrator</b> <b>engine.</b> Predicted performance maps of the wave rotor cycle were used along with maps of existing gas turbine hardware in a design point study. The effects of wave rotor topping on the engine cycle and the subsequent need to rematch compressor and turbine sections in the topped engine were addressed. Comparison of performance of the resulting engine is {{made on the basis of}} wave rotor topped engine versus an appropriate baseline engine using common shaft compressor hardware. The topped engine design clearly demonstrates an impressive improvement in shaft horsepower (+ 11. 4 %) and SFC (- 22 %). Off design part power engine performance for the wave rotor topped engine was similarly improved including that at engine idle conditions. Operation of the engine at off design was closely examined with wave rotor operation at less than design burner outlet temperatures and rotor speeds. Challenges identified in the development of a <b>demonstrator</b> <b>engine</b> are discussed. A preliminary design was made of the <b>demonstrator</b> <b>engine</b> including wave rotor to engine transition ducts.

40|$|A {{computational}} procedure able {{to describe}} the coupled hot-gas/wall/coolant environment that occurs in most liquid rocket engines is presented and demonstrated. The coupled analysis is performed by loose coupling of the two-dimensional axisymmetric Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the hot-gas flow and the conjugate three-dimensional model for the coolant flow and solid material heat transfer in the regenerative cooling circuit. The latter model is in turn based on the coupled Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the coolant flow and Fourier equation for the thermal conduction in the solid material. In this study, the thermal behavior of a regeneratively cooled oxygen/methane <b>engine</b> <b>demonstrator</b> is analyzed in detail. Starting from a nominal operative condition of the engine, different levels of channel surface roughness and coolant mass flow rate are considered {{in order to understand}} their influence on the heat transfer capability of the cooling system.

40|$|The {{isolated}} counterrotating {{high speed}} turboprop noise prediction program was compared with model data {{taken in the}} GE Aircraft Engines Cell 41 anechoic facility, the Boeing Transonic Wind Tunnel, and in NASA-Lewis' 8 x 6 and 9 x 15 wind tunnels. The predictions show good agreement with measured data under both low and high speed simulated flight conditions. The installation effect model developed for single rotation, high speed turboprops was extended to include counterotation. The additional effect of mounting a pylon upstream of the forward rotor {{was included in the}} flow field modeling. A nontraditional mechanism concerning the acoustic radiation from a propeller at angle of attach was investigated. Predictions made using this approach show results that are in much closer agreement with measurement over a range of operating conditions than those obtained via traditional fluctuating force methods. The isolated rotors and installation effects models were combines into a single prediction program, results of which were compared with data taken during the flight test of the B 727 /UDF <b>engine</b> <b>demonstrator</b> aircraft.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{program was}} started in 1994 {{within the framework of}} the German Aeronautics Research Program to develop axial staged combustor technology up to a core <b>engine</b> <b>demonstrator.</b> The objective was to demonstrate a 50 % NOx reduction against the ICAO CAEP II limit without any compromise on the CO, UHC and smoke emission level compared to the latest single annular combustor technology. All other requirements, like ignition and relight capability, stability, durability and turbine inlet temperature traverse, were set equal to today’s state-of-the-art combustors. The combustor cooling concept chosen was of the angled effusion type. Development of adequate modeling techniques and steady-state and transient rig tests to calibrate the thermal models was the key factor for the success of the project. Despite the 15 % increase in cooled surface, the overall combustor flow fraction required for cooling was reduced by 15 % without any change in the combustor liner material from that of the in-service single annular combustor of the BR 715. The axially staged combustor technology developed in the described program enables RR Deutschland to offer a staged combustor for the BR 715 within the usual timescale of an engine certification process. It also forms the basis for future combustor technology to limit NOx-emissions for advanced engine cycles. Nomenclature Ageom Geometric coolant flow area AFR Air fuel rati...|$|E

40|$|This thesis first {{provided}} strategic {{recommendations for}} the research sponsor, Rolls- Royce plc (RR) and then applied optical diagnostics to measure aero gas turbine fuel spray properties in order to predict Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions and combustion instability. Analysis of the large civil aero engine sector suggested {{possible courses of action}} for RR to protect itself from short-term market volatilities and also prepare for three long term changes in strategic operating context: air traffic growth; tighter United Nations enforced aero engine combustion emissions legislation and entry of civil aviation into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. A collaborative game theoretic approach was explored during the pre-competitive, pre-technology, capability acquisition aero engine design phase on unproven future technologies to reduce R&D expenditures, development times and the costs of failure. Lean Prevapourised Premixed combustion demands excellent spray atomisation quality to sustain combustion efficiency, stability and to minimise pollutants. Post development of an improved procedure to calibrate laser signals, methodology to predict NOx and technique to optimise rig operating conditions that minimised fractional discrepancies in two-phase flow behaviour with corresponding engine conditions, this thesis applied quantitative Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Laser Sheet Dropsizing (LSD) to measure the fuel placement and dropsize distribution in the near nozzle regions of RR liquid-fuelled hybrid, airblast and pressure-swirl sprays. Measurements were made under non-combusting, low pressure conditions and results were processed to identify fuel injector designs that exhibited low emissions and high stability for the Affordable Near Term Low Emissions (ANTLE) and Instability Control of Low Emission Aero-Engine Combustors (ICLEAC) <b>engine</b> <b>demonstrator</b> programmes. Results also provided validation data and boundary conditions for spray computational codes. Research findings will improve RR core competencies in fuel injection research to accelerate the development and deployment of low emissions aero engine technology...|$|E
40|$|The active debris {{removal of}} a large object, such as {{the second stage of}} Cosmos- 3 M, is a complex mission which {{requires}} the combination of several advanced technologies. A very crucial aspect is the selection of propulsion system, since it must allow the safe removing of the target from a LEO orbit and its controlled reentry in the atmosphere. Hybrid rocket technology seems to be a valuable option due to its high performance and flexible functioning. In particular the use of hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer, provides several advantages: high density, high performance with HTPB and easy reignition capability, monopropellant for attitude control system (RCS). From the preliminary sizing of the Hybrid Engine Module results a propulsion system with a wet weight of approximately 520 kg, a specific impulse of 305 s and thrusts of the order of 12 - 15 kN. Several tests on non-classical hybrid engines have demonstrated the possibility to obtain higher combustion efficiency and performance than typical hybrid rockets, keeping, in addition, very compact sizes. Nevertheless the hybrid vortex combustion has still to be tested at high ranges of specific oxidizer mass flow rate, typically classic hybrid operative conditions. For the considered mission the diameter of a VFP hybrid engine results of 53 cm, with a total engine length of 91 cm (including nozzle). Such little dimensions make easier the realization of a full-scale <b>engine</b> <b>demonstrator,</b> starting from lab-scale experimental tests, thanks to the small jump of scale. The resulting sizes of HEM as well its weight allow to use low-cost space launchers, such as VEGA or Dnepr- 1 and, considering the total launcher carrying capacity (for example VEGA carries about 1500 kg to LEO), multiple ADR missions can be performed by a single launch...|$|E
