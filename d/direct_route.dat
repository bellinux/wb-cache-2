Sinclair contributed two goals to FC Gold Pride's 4–0 win to clinch the WPS Championship. Despite their successful season, the club ceased operations on November 16, 2010, due to not meeting the league's financial reserve requirement.|$|E
5|$|The M54 {{currently}} {{meets the}} M6 at junction 10A {{where there is}} no access to the northbound M6 or to the M6 Toll. Northbound access to the M6 is via the A449 from junction 2 and the most <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> to the M6 Toll is via the congested A460 from junction 1.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more <b>direct</b> <b>route,</b> via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more <b>direct</b> <b>route,</b> via Northern Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent {{the bulk of his}} army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
5|$|I-75 takes a more <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> between Indian River and Mackinaw City. M-27 follows old US27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan. With US23 it is a scenic, if indirect, {{alternative}} to I-75 on {{its approach to}} the Mackinac Bridge. M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms {{the main street of}} Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 runs parallel to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.|$|E

5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which spanned the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge {{was a more}} <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> for the flow of traffic across the river; particularly for trucks and heavy vehicles from the industrial area. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 and closed in 2009 due to deterioration. The bridge was demolished by Joseph B. Fay Co. on February 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E
5|$|US-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} in Oklahoma around 1935. The highway's route {{at that time}} was largely the same as it is today; however, between the Afton area and Welch, US-59 passed through Vinita instead following the modern-day route passing east of it. US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951. Since then, US-59 has undergone only minor adjustments, many of which eliminated curves and provided a more <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> for travelers using the highway to traverse eastern Oklahoma.|$|E

5|$|When {{parliament}} {{passed the}} building of the Bergen Line in 1894, the Roa–Hønefoss branch line was made part of the plans; but the line was given a separate name indicating that the Bergen Line would continue from Hønefoss to Oslo in a more <b>direct</b> <b>route.</b> But after the finish of the Bergen Line, other important mainline routes, in particular the Dovre Line, Sørland Line and Nordland Line, combined with the effort to convert narrow gauge line, took precedence. Ideas for the additional construction of the Ringerike Line were pressed by commercial interests in Ringerike in both 1890 and 1906, but failed both times.|$|E
5|$|Before the 13th century, the <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> {{to the sea}} at Highbridge {{was blocked}} by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river {{partially}} encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route {{made it difficult for}} the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250, a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1934, {{the road}} east of Mecca had been paved. The {{western part of}} the road, known as the Box Canyon road, from Mecca to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was {{eventually}} bypassed in favor of a more <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> to Indio, diverging at Shavers' Summit. Between 1934 and 1936, US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio, and the portion between US 99 and Mecca was paved. Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills. By 1940, the SR 195 designation was signed. In the 1940s, the highway continued due west of Mecca to end at an intersection with US 99, rather than turning south.|$|E

5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and {{it was estimated that}} the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines.

5|$|In 535, Bessas was {{appointed}} {{as one of}} Belisarius' lieutenants (along with Constantine and Peranius) in the expedition against the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy. He accompanied Belisarius {{in the early stages}} of the campaign, from the recovery of Sicily to the siege of Naples, and was present at the latter's fall in November 536. From there the Byzantine army advanced on Rome, which it captured without a fight. Belisarius sent Constantine and Bessas to capture various outlying towns, but when he learned that the new Gothic king, Witiges, was marching on Rome, he recalled them. Bessas tarried for a while near the town of Narni, which controlled the <b>direct</b> <b>route</b> from the Gothic capital, Ravenna, over the Apennines to Rome, and there met and defeated the Gothic vanguard in a skirmish.|$|E

Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more <b>direct</b> <b>route.</b> As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
