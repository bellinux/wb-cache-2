40|$|Depolarization lidars {{are widely}} used {{for the study of}} clouds and {{aerosols}} because of their ability to discriminate between spherical particles and particles of irregular shape. Depolarization of cloud backscatter can be caused also by the multiple scattering events. One of the ways to gain information about particle parameters in the presence of strong multiple scattering is the measurement of azimuthally dependent polarization patterns in the focal plane of receiver. In this paper we present an algorithm for the calculation of corresponding polarized patterns in the frame of double scattering approximation. The computations are performed for different parameters of scattering geometry, e. g. cloud base and sounding depth. Intensity distribution of <b>depolarized</b> <b>component</b> is of cross-shape and rotated at 45 dg with respect to laser polarization. The use of a properly oriented cross-shape mask in the receiver focal plane allows removing a significant portion of <b>depolarized</b> <b>component</b> produced by double scattering. To verify it experimentally, cloud depolarization measurements were performed with different orientations of cross-shape mask. Results obtained from measurements are in qualitative agreement with the model prediction...|$|E

The authors have proposed polarimetric SAR interferometry {{based on the}} ESPRIT algorithm. However, the algorithm assumes that there exist dominant polarized components in both the ground and canopy.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus was investigated using guinea-pig brain slices. GABA either superfused or applied directly by microiontophoresis produced a biphasic response in pyramidal cells, comprising hyperpolarizing and <b>depolarizing</b> <b>components.</b> When different concentrations of GABA were applied to the same neurone, the lower concentrations generally produced a hyperpolarization-predominant response, while higher concentrations resulted in a depolarization-predominant response. The <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> of the response to GABA was augmented in a medium containing a low concentration of Cl-, relatively unaffected by a change in external K+ concentration, and blocked by picrotoxin (2 X 10 (- 5) M). The depolarizing response to GABA persisted in a Ca 2 +-free medium in which the concentration of Na+ was reduced to 13 mM. Combined application of low doses of picrotoxin and bicuculline eliminated the {{major part of the}} <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> of the biphasic response to GABA and produced a relatively pure hyperpolarizing response. The reversal potential of this pharmacologically 'isolated' hyperpolarizing response to GABA was estimated, from the current-voltage relationships, to be about - 90 mV and was {{the same as that of}} the hyperpolarization induced by baclofen. When the membrane was successively hyperpolarized by inward direct current (d. c.) injections, the reversal point of the 'pharmacologically isolated' hyperpolarizing response to GABA coincided with that of the post-burst hyperpolarization. Low concentrations of Cl- in the bathing medium had no noticeable effect on the hyperpolarizing component of the response to GABA, whereas it markedly increased the amplitude of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component.</b> These results suggest that {{the action of}} GABA in the hippocampus may involve an activation of K+ conductance...|$|R

40|$|Cerebellar Purkinje cells receive two {{different}} excitatory inputs from parallel and climbing fibers, causing simple and complex spikes, respectively. Purkinje cells present three modes of simple spike firing, namely tonic, silent and bursting. The influence of complex spike firing on simple spike firing {{has been extensively}} studied. However, it is unknown whether and how the simple spike firing mode may influence complex spike waveform and firing rate in vivo. We studied complex spike firing during tonic and silent mode periods in non-anesthetized mice. We found that complex spike firing rate is not influenced by simple spike firing modes, but that the complex spike waveform is altered following high frequency simple spike firing. This alteration is a specific decrement of the second <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> of the complex spike. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the second <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> is inversely proportional to the simple spike firing rate preceding the complex spike and that this amplitude is independent of previous complex spike firing.

The ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) {{contains a}} heterogeneous collection of cell types reflecting the multiple processing tasks undertaken by this nucleus. This in vivo {{study in the}} rat used intracellular recordings and dye filling to examine membrane potential changes and firing characteristics of onset chopper (OC) neurons to acoustic stimulation (50 ms pure tones, 5 ms r/f time). Stable impalements were made from 15 OC neurons, 7 identified as multipolar cells. Neurons responded to characteristic frequency (CF) tones with sustained depolarization below spike threshold. With increasing stimulus intensity, the depolarization during the initial 10 ms of the response became peaked, and with further increases in intensity the peak became narrower. Onset spikes were generated during this initial depolarization. Tones presented below CF resulted in a broadening of this initial <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> with high stimulus intensities required to initiate onset spikes. This initial component {{was followed by a}} sustained <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> lasting until stimulus cessation. The amplitude of the sustained <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> was greatest when frequencies were presented at high intensities below CF resulting in increased action potential firing during this period when compared with comparable high intensities at CF. During the presentation of tones at or above the high-frequency edge of a cell’s response area, hyperpolarization was evident during the sustained component. The presence of hyperpolarization and the differences seen in the level of sustained depolarization during CF and off CF tones suggests that changes in membrane responsiveness between the initial and sustained components may be attributed to polysynaptic inhibitory mechanisms. The dual-component processing resulting from convergent auditory nerve excitation and polysynaptic inhibition enables OC neurons to respond in a unique fashion to intensity and frequency features contained within an acoustic stimulus.

Linear particle depolarization ratio (δ part) was computed using the relative amplification factor and the system-dependent molecular depolarization. The low <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> was considered as urban/smoke, with a mean δ part of 3 %, while for the high <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> (mineral dust) a mean δ part of 35 % was assumed. For this study 11 months of lidar measurements were analysed. Two study cases are presented in details: one for a typical Saharan dust aerosol intrusion, 10 June 2012 and one for 12 July 2012 when a lofted layer consisting of biomass burning smoke extended from 3 to 4. 5 km height. Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds software package (OPAC) classification and conversion factors were used to calculate mass concentrations. We found that calibrated depolarization measurements are critical in distinguishing between smoke-reach aerosol during the winter and dust-reach aerosol during the summer, as well as between elevated aerosol layers having different origins.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of translational modes to the reorientational {{motion is}} an essential property of systems with internal orientational degrees of freedom. Due to their high complexity most of those systems (molecular crystals, glasses [...] .) present a major puzzle for scientists. In this paper we analyze the Raman scattering of a relatively simple ferroelectric system, KTa(1 -x) Nb(x) O(3), which {{may serve as a}} model for more complicated cases. We are showing that there is a strong coupling between translational and reorientational motion in the crystal. Our data suggest that this coupling is the main reason for the <b>depolarized</b> <b>component</b> of the second order Raman spectra and that it is also responsible for lowering of the frequency (softening) of the transverse acoustic mode down to the third of three transitions, below which reorientational motion is no longer allowed.

The selection of the <b>depolarized</b> <b>component</b> of the scattered light results in {{a significant increase in}} the C-C bond signal over the second order SiC Raman signal, which allows to resolve submonolayer growth, including individual, localized C=C dimers in a diamond-like carbon matrix for AES C/Si ratio of ∼ 3, and a strained graphene layer with delocalized electrons and Dirac single-band dispersion for AES C/Si ratio > 6. The linear strain, measured at room temperature, is found to be compressive, which can be attributed to the large difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of graphene and SiC. The magnitude of the compressive strain can be varied by adjusting the growth time at fixed annealing temperature. Comment: 4 pages, 2 images - final versio...|$|E

Here, we explored the different modes of PC firing in alert mice by extracellular recording. We confirm {{the existence of}} a tonic and/or bursting and quiescent modes corresponding to UP and DOWN state, respectively. We demonstrate {{the existence of a}} novel 600 -Hz buzz UP state of firing characterized by simple spikes (SS) of very small amplitude. Climbing fiber (CF) input is able to switch the 600 -Hz buzz to the DOWN state, as for the classical UP-to-DOWN state transition. Conversely, the CF input can initiate a typical SS pattern terminating into 600 -Hz buzz. The 600 -Hz buzz was transiently suppressed by whisker pad stimulation demonstrating that it remained responsive to peripheral input. It must not be mistaken for a DOWN state or the sign of PC inhibition. Complex spike (CS) frequency was increased during the 600 -Hz buzz, indicating that this PC output actively contributes to the cerebello-olivary loop by triggering a disinhibition of the inferior olive. During the 600 -Hz buzz, the first <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> of the CS was reduced and the second <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> was suppressed. Consistent with our experimental observations, using a 559 -compartment single-PC model - in which PC UP state (of about - 43. mV) was obtained by the combined action of large tonic AMPA conductances and counterbalancing GABAergic inhibition - removal of this inhibition produced the 600 -Hz buzz; the simulated buzz frequency decreased following an artificial CS. © 2014 IBRO.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and test results of the new optical particle counter TOPS-Ice (Thermostabilized Optical Particle Spectrometer {{for the detection of}} Ice particles). The instrument uses measurements of the <b>depolarized</b> <b>component</b> of light scattered by single particles into the near-forward direction (42. 5 ° ± 12. 7 °) to distinguish between spherical and non-spherical particles. This approach allows the differentiation between liquid water droplets (spherical) and ice particles (non-spherical) having similar volume equivalent sizes and therefore can be used to determine the fraction of frozen droplets in a typical immersion freezing experiment. We show that the numerical simulation of the light scattering on non-spherical particles (ellipsoids in random orientation) with account for the actual scattering geometry used in the instrument supports the validity of the approach, even though the cross polarized component of the light scattered by spherical droplets is not vanishing in this scattering angle. For the separation of the ice particle mode from the liquid droplet mode, we use the width of the pulse detected in the depolarization channel instead of the pulse height. Exploiting the intrinsic relationship between pulse height and pulse width for Gaussian pulses allows us to calculate the fraction of frozen droplets even if the liquid droplet mode dominates the particle ensemble. We present test results obtained with TOPS-Ice in the immersion freezing experiments at the laminar diffusion chamber LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator) and demonstrate the excellent agreement with the data obtained in the same experiment with a different optical instrument. Finally, the advantages of using the cross-polarized light measurements for the differentiation of liquid and frozen droplets in the realistic immersion freezing experiments are discussed...|$|E

In contrast, U- 50, 488, a kappa-opiate agonist, had no effect. When the slices were synaptically uncoupled by elevating the concentration of external magnesium, oxytocin still excited non-pyramidal neurones and DAGO still inhibited them. Thus, opiates and oxytocin exerted direct, opposite effects on the same population of neurones, which apparently bear mu-type receptors.

Specific agonists were puffed {{in the presence}} of cobalt, picrotoxin and strychnine to identify glutamate receptors on these cells. Most Cabs responded to both the-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) /kainate receptor agonist kainate and the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) substrate D-aspartate, and both responses were localized to the dendrites. Kainate generated depolarizations whereas D-aspartate had Erev close to ECl and generated hyperpolarizations, indicating that the AMPA/kainate receptors are signpreserving whereas the EAATs are sign-inverting. In response to white light, some Cabs gave ON bipolar cell-like responses whereas others gave OFF bipolar cell-like ones, but many cells' responses had both ON and OFF bipolar cell components. In response to appropriately colored center-selective stimuli, many Cabs responded to short and long wavelengths with opposite polarities and were thus double color-opponent. The <b>depolarizing</b> <b>components</b> of the responses to white or colored stimuli were suppressed by the EAAT blocker DL-threo [...] benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), whereas the hyperpolarizing components were reduced by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that both EAATs and AMPA/kainate receptors are involved in the generation of light-evoked responses in Cabs, and that they confer these cells with ON and OFF bipolar cell properties, respectively. Cabs can generate double color-opponent center responses by receiving inputs from certain cones through EAATs and from other cones through AMPA/kainate receptors. ...|$|R

Calcium imaging and cell attached recordings showed that these neurons spontaneously fired bursts of action potentials that lasted for seconds over a wide range of frequencies. In 2 -wk-old cells, the median firing frequency was low (11 +/- 8. 8 Hz), whereas in 3 - to 4 -wk-old cells, it decreased to a very low value (2 +/- 1. 3 Hz). In both cases, we have shown that the slowest synaptic component supported firing. In 2 -wk-old autapses, antagonists of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) induced rare isolated spikes showing that the NMDA component of the EPSP was essential for bursts at low frequency. In 3 - to 4 -wk-old neurons, the very low frequency firing was maintained without the NMDAR activation. However EGTA-AM or alpha-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) removed the very slow <b>depolarizing</b> <b>component</b> of the EPSP and prevented the sustained firing at very low rate. A metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) -activated calcium sensitive conductance is therefore responsible for a very slow synaptic component associated with firing at very low rate. In addition, our observations suggested that the asynchronous release of glutamate might participate also in the recurring bursting...|$|R

Motivated by low-cost, low-complexity systems (e. g., wireless sensors) that may be deployed in such environments, this work explores the benefits of polarization diversity using very large data sets collected over a small area and over the 5 - 6 GHz band. The results also demonstrate that antennas capable of capturing <b>depolarized</b> signal <b>components</b> can significantly mitigate the harshest of fading environments.
