5000|$|The <b>Java</b> <b>barb</b> (Barbonymus gonionotus; ตะเพียน Ta-phian; Lao Pa keng; ត្រីឆ្ពិន Trey Chpin; Tawes), more {{commonly}} known as silver barb in aquaculture, is a species of ray-finned fish in the genus Barbonymus.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{actually}} very close {{relatives of the}} common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Even though only five species are included at present, it is not certain whether these form a monophyletic lineage; the <b>Java</b> <b>barb</b> (B. gonionotus) for example {{seems to be very}} close indeed to Cyclocheilichthys, which unites a number of barb-like [...] "carps". Past hybridization is known widely in Cyprinidae, and confounds molecular and other cladistic studies relying on a single source of data. Altogether the delimitation of the typical carps and allied genera remains still not fully solved.|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} know the effect of electric shock using gene pulser at different voltage level toward motility and viability of <b>Java</b> <b>barb</b> fish sperm. This research was conducted at Fish Breeding Laboratory, Faculty of Marine and Fisheries and LSIH of Brawijaya University-Malang in May 2017. The trial design used Complete Randomized Design with 3 different treatments and 1 control which each treatment repeated 3 times. The treatments used the Gene pulser with 3 different voltages: A (20 V), B (30 V), C (40 V). The result showed that the electric {{shock treatment}} with different voltages level affected motility and viability of <b>Java</b> <b>barb</b> fish sperm. Based on the data analysis used polynomial orthogonal, a linear-form of the relationship among the treatments in the form of equation was found (Puntius javanicus) with R 2 = 0. 9815 and equation y = - 40. 5 x + 130. 83 with R 2 = 0. 8626. Based on the result of this research, electroporation for <b>Java</b> <b>barb</b> fish 2 ̆ 7 sperm as gene transfer media should be done with voltage 20 V, pulse number 4 times and pulse length 1 ms...|$|E

This research had been conducted in the Laboratory of Nutrition and Feed, Faculty of Husbandry, and Wet Laboratorium, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science, all of Padjadjaran University. Research design applied use Completely Randomized Design, 6 treatments and 3 times replication. The conclusion of feeding trial to <b>java</b> <b>barb</b> shown that the highest growth is found at 5 % corncob fermentation fish feed, while the highest growth rate and the lowest fish feed conversion were found in more than 5 %...|$|E
