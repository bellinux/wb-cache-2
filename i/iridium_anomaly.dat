5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of iridium, an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a meteorite impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute the extinction event and the <b>iridium</b> <b>anomaly</b> to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of the extinction have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early Paleocene. However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a blurring of the <b>iridium</b> <b>anomaly</b> and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an <b>iridium</b> <b>anomaly</b> in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E

2500|$|A briefly popular theory {{held that}} a 12C-rich comet struck the earth and {{initiated}} the warming event. A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the <b>iridium</b> <b>anomaly</b> at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of kaolinitic clays with abundant magnetic nanoparticles on the coastal shelf of New Jersey, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum. Indeed, a key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Even allowing for feedback processes, this would require at least 100 gigatons of extraterrestrial carbon. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark on the globe. Unfortunately, the evidence put forward does not stand up to scrutiny. An unusual 9-meter-thick clay layer supposedly formed soon after the impact, containing unusual amounts of magnetite, but it formed too slowly for these magnetic particles {{to have been a}} result of the comet's impact. and it turns out they were created by bacteria.

Clay-mineral analyses indicate that the boundary clay is similar to locally derived clays in the limestones above and below the boundary, and contains no detectable exotic components. This supports a terrestrial origin for the boundary clay. The genesis of the boundary clay is attributed to changes in ocean chemistry (pH and oxygenation), leading to an interval of widespread dissolution of carbonate sequences in the oceans, and culminating in the development of submarine pyritic hardgrounds and a disconformity of global extent...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} macroevolutionary {{patterns and}} dynamics in planktonic foraminifera and accompanying {{changes in their}} pelagic environment. My research focuses on processes that structure diversity in the open sea, including the response of oceanic ecosystems to the largest biotic disturbance of the Cenozoic, the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. I begin by investigating the determinants of community similarity in modern planktonic foraminiferal communities. Here, I find that community similarity is primarily determined by the environmental similarity between communities, and not geographic distance. On a global scale, planktonic foraminifera provide {{an exception to the}} rule that geographic proximity is the strongest predictor of community similarity. Patterns of morphological evolution in planktonic foraminifera also suggest that different evolutionary processes may predominate in the open ocean. I investigate a classic case of gradual evolution in the Globorotalia plesiotumida-G. tumida lineage of planktonic foraminifera using more sensitive numerical techniques and find evidence for a cryptic speciation event and a more rapid evolution of G. tumida than previously hypothesized. New analytical approaches were also developed in order to ask questions at a higher stratigraphic resolution at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary than is currently possible. To this end, Lagrangian advection-diffusion models were modified to fit <b>iridium</b> <b>anomalies</b> deposited by the KPg impactor. Insights into the recovery of pelagic ecosystems from the KPg mass extinction were obtained from high-resolution geochemical, grain size, and taxonomic records of the early post-extinction interval. Barium proxy records were used to investigate boundary-related changes in export productivity, and supported inferences from benthic foraminifera in describing geographically and temporally heterogeneous changes in export productivity following the KPg impact. When productivity was considered along with planktonic foraminifera community composition and relative flux, this evidence suggested that an alternative pelagic ecosystem may have thrived in some locales in a post-extinction worl...|$|R
40|$|An <b>iridium</b> {{abundance}} <b>anomaly</b> at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (C/T) boundary {{has been}} disclosed at 36 sites throughout the globe.

The extinction's 'killing mechanism' {{has not yet been}} established, but both temperature changes and darkness due to atmospheric dust are probable contributors. In view of the rapid dispersal of dust in ballistic trajectories, the rapid settling of heavy, coagulated dust particles, the effects of darkness on phytoplankton, and plant records, it is suggested that darkness would have lasted a few months, rather than the originally hypothesized few years...|$|R
40|$|The Eocene-Oligocene {{transition}} {{marks the}} passage from “greenhouse” conditions to an “icehouse state” with progressive global cooling starting in the early middle Eocene. The late Eocene is also characterized by {{a high concentration of}} extraterrestrial impacts, the effects of which, on living organisms and climatic changes, are still not understood. We carried out a high-resolution investigation on planktonic foraminiferal assemblages in an 8 -m-thick segment of the Massignano global stratotype section and point for the Eocene-Oligocene boundary with the aim of assessing the effects that the impacts may have had on the environment and this group of organisms. The studied interval is punctuated by three late Eocene iridium-rich layers, several cosmic signatures, and enhanced levels of ³He. The two lower closely spaced <b>iridium</b> <b>anomalies</b> are possibly linked to the Popigai and Chesapeake Bay impact events, respectively, whereas no particular impact event can be assigned to the third anomaly, even if it might be correlated with some large craters. Interpretation of data suggests that all the impacts had no abrupt, dramatic effects on planktonic foraminifera. However, acting as forcing factors, they induced some environmental perturbations and may have contributed to remarkable climate changes superimposed on the general late Eocene cooling trend. The Popigai and Chesapeake Bay impact events triggered significant changes in the water mass structure, in terms of stratification and trophic resources, associated with some climatic excursions that took place within chron C 16 n. 1 n and chron C 15 r and at the transition between planktonic foraminiferal zones P 15 and P 16. The short-term warming pulse recognized after the Popigai impact might have been due to greenhouse effects produced by injection of CO₂ into the atmosphere and/or the release of methane hydrate after the impact itself. The dynamic between hydrological and climate changes across the impactoclastic layers as observed at Massignano displays different features at each impact event, probably due to the context in which each occurred in terms of impactor size, location, and target rocks. The relatively long duration of the enhanced cooling following the Chesapeake Bay impact suggests that this event induced a progressive cooling and triggered a feedback mechanism that sustained the initial impact-induced changes. Similar patterns of climatic excursions reported worldwide across the equivalent impact-ejecta horizons indicate that the impact-induced climate changes recorded at Massignano appear to be global in extent...|$|R

We analyzed {{the shape of the}} Ir profiles with a Lagrangian particle-tracking model of sediment mixing. Fits between the mixing model and measured Ir profiles, as well as visible burrows in the cores, show that the shape of the Ir profiles was determined primarily by sediment mixing via bioturbation. In contrast, Tighe Park 1 and Bass River cores show post-depositional remobilization of Ir by geochemical processes. There is a strong inverse relationship between the maximum concentration of Ir measured and the thickness of the sediments over which Ir is spread. We show that the depth-integrated Ir inventory is similar in the majority of the cores, indicating that the total Ir delivery at time of the K/Pg event was spatially homogeneous over this region. Though delivered through a near-instantaneous source, stratospheric dispersal, and settling, our study shows that non-uniform Ir profiles develop due to changes in the regional delivery and post-depositional modification by bioturbation and geochemical processes...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{decades of}} study, the exact {{cause of the}} Cretaceous-Paleogene {{boundary}} (KPB) mass extinction remains contentious. Hypothesized scenarios center around two main environmental perturbations: voluminous (> 10 ^ 6 km 3) volcanic eruptions from the Deccan Traps in modern-day India, and the large impact recorded by the Chicxulub crater. The impact hypothesis has gained broad support, bolstered by the discoveries of <b>iridium</b> <b>anomalies,</b> shocked quartz, and spherules at the KPB worldwide, which are contemporaneous with the Chicxulub impact structure. However, evidence for protracted extinctions, particularly in non-marine settings, and paleoenvironmental change associated with climatic swings before the KPB, challenge {{the notion that the}} impact was the sole cause of the KPB mass extinction. Despite forty years of study, the relative importance of each of these events is unclear, and one key inhibitor is insufficient resolution of existing geochronology. In this dissertation, I present work developing a high-precision global chronologic framework for the KPB that outlines the temporal sequence of biotic changes (both within the terrestrial and marine realms), climatic changes, and proposed perturbations (i. e. impact, volcanic eruptions) using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and paleomagnetism. This work is focused on two major areas of study: 1) refining the timing and tempo of terrestrial ecosystem change around the KPB, and 2) calibrating the geomagnetic polarity timescale, and particularly the timing and duration of magnetic polarity chron C 29 r (the KPB falls about halfway into C 29 r). First I develop a high-precision chronostratigraphic framework for fluvial sediments within the Hell Creek region, in NE Montana, {{which is one of the}} best-studied terrestrial KPB sections worldwide. For this work I dated 15 tephra deposits with ± 30 ka precision using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology, ranging in time from ~ 300 ka before the KPB to 1 Ma after. By tying these results to paleontological records, this work is able to constrain the timing of terrestrial faunal decline and recovery in addition to calibrating late Cretaceous and early Paleocene North American Land Mammal Ages biostratigraphy. To aid in global correlation, I next sought to calibrate the timing and duration of C 29 r. However, based on discrepancies noticed between a calculated duration for C 29 r, from new dates collected as part of this dissertation and previously published magnetostratigraphy for the Hell Creek region, and the duration provided within the Geologic Time Scale 2012, it became clear that reliability of sediments from the Hell Creek as paleomagnetic recorders was suspect. To test this claim, a complete characterization of the rock magnetic properties of sediments from the Hell Creek region was undertaken. To aid characterization, a new test to determine the presence of intermediate composition titanohematite (Fe 2 -yTiyO 3; 0. 5 ≤ y ≤ 0. 7) was developed. Results from rock magnetic characterization show that sediments from the Hell Creek should be reliable paleomagnetic recorders, so long as care is taken to remove goethite (a secondary mineral that previous magnetostratigraphic studies in the Hell Creek did not remove), and to avoid samples that have been heated above ~ 200 ºC. With the knowledge that sediments from the Hell Creek region are reliable magnetic recorders, I collected 14 new magnetostratigraphic sections, and 18 new high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates which together provide constraints on the timing and duration of chron C 29 r, at unprecedented precision. This work enables correlation of our record in the Hell Creek to other KPB records around the globe, in addition to providing a test of the Paleocene astrochronologic timescale...|$|R

The {{background}} Ir abundance averaged 11 parts per trillion (ppt) and a clay-enriched region had nearly the same average, 26 ± 12 ppt. If the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) contact is in the region studied, then sedimentation was not continuous, and the K-T boundary was probably either not deposited or it was eroded away. In {{a study of}} Cores 15 X and 16 X of ODP Hole 690 C, an iridium peak with a maximum abundance of 1566 ± 222 ppt was found in Section 4 of Core 15 X at 39 - 40 cm with a half-width of 6. 6 cm. Background abundances were ~ 15 ppt and distinctly higher Ir abundances were observed from 119 cm below to 72 cm above the main peak. The Ir distribution below the main peak is attributed to bioturbation by organisms with burrows extending at least 0. 4 m. The Ir distribution above the main peak {{may be due to the}} same cause but other explanations may be significant. There are variable enrichments of clay in the mainly CaCO 3 sediment of Core 15 X, and the stratigraphically lowest part of the most abundant clay deposits is found (within 2 cm) in the same position as the main Ir peak. The clay deposit, which is estimated to be about 50 % of the sediment, extends upward ~ 19 cm and then slowly decreases to a background level of 10 % over 1 m. The degree of homogeneity of the clay-rich interval suggests it was not due to episodic volcanism but may have been due to a decrease of the CaCO 3 deposition rate which was possibly triggered by the impact of a large asteroid or comet on the Earth...|$|R

Based on the newest age data the age estimate is 10 million years. As the Ir was deposited at the two sites {{at about the same time}} and they are one quarter of the way around the world from each other it seems likely that the deposition was world-wide. The impact of a large asteroid or comet could produce the wide distribution, and this data is supportive of the impact relationship deduced for Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) 588 B from the chemical evidence. If the surface densities of Ir at the two sites are representative of the world-wide average, the diameter of a Cl type asteroid containing the necessary Ir would be 3 + or - 1 km, which is large enough to cause world-wide darkness and hence extinctions although the latter point is disputed...|$|R
