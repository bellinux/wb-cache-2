5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> time in a French Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals.

Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
