I need to start playing regularly again as soon as possible". Former club York, by this time playing in the Conference National, made a failed bid to sign him on loan in September 2006.

2500|$|Flair {{engaged in}} an {{off-screen}} rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview {{in which he said}} Flair [...] "sucks" [...] and described his workplace, WCW, as [...] "minor league". In Flair's autobiography, Flair criticizes Hart for over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as [...] "plain ridiculous" [...] in a column written for the Calgary Sun. Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart acknowledged a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he and others felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well publicized sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars. In contrast to Flair's claims, prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer said there was [...] "no denying" [...] Hart's major drawing power in the United States. WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could [...] "have built the entire franchise around Hart" [...] and described him as an [...] "extraordinary star". McMahon added that it was [...] "fortunate for me, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> company", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as [...] "an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe". Professional wrestling magazine Power Slam has spoken to Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in [...] "The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders", a list that considered drawing ability along with workrate and promo skills. Hart also criticized Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading. However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E

ARCHER, - I {{have read}} your paper with my {{customary}} admiration; {{it is very}} witty, very adroit; it contains a great deal that is excellently true (particularly the parts about my stories and the description of me as an artist in life); but {{you will not be}} surprised if I do not think it altogether just. It seems to me, in particular, that you have wilfully read all my works <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> earliest; my aim, even in style, has quite changed in the last six or seven years; and this I should have thought you would have noticed. Again, your first remark upon the affectation of the italic names; a practice only followed in my two affected little books of travel, where a typographical MINAUDERIE of the sort appeared to me in character; and what you say of it, then, is quite just. But why should you forget yourself and use these same italics as an index to my theology some pages further on? This is lightness of touch indeed; may I say, it is almost sharpness of practice? ...|$|E
