40|$|Three heat {{resistant}} cross-linked PVC <b>foam</b> <b>plastics</b> were prepared and their performances {{were compared with}} universal cross-linked PVC structural foam. The results show that these three {{heat resistant}} foams have higher glass transition temperatures (close to 100 &# 176;C) than universal structural foam (83. 2 &# 176;C). Compared with the universal structural foam, the three heat resistant foams show much higher decomposition temperature and better chemical stability due to the crosslinking of PVC macromolecular chains.

40|$|As per our proposal, we have {{examined}} the Code Change Resolution submitted by the Safer Insulation Solution (Ref. 1) and the accompanied paper by V. Babrauskas (Ref. 2). In summary, the referenced documents claim the following: 1) Fire safety will not be decreased by waiving the fire performance of <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulation in IRC 316. 3 in lieu of placing a protective thermal barrier in front of non-FR treated foams for wall and ceiling constructions or where the foam insulation lies on the exterior and below grade of buildings. 2) The ASTM E 84 test method does not represent full scale test results for <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulations. 3) Halogenated FR treated <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulations are a health hazard that poses a threat greater than the fire hazard of non-FR treated foams when protected as defined above. With full respect for Dr. Babrauskas as a fire scientist, we disagree with these claims as described below. On item 1, Ref. 2, it is stated that: Current codes require <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> insulation materials to have both protection by a thermal barrier and compliance with Steiner Tunnel test requirements [ [...] . ] Insulations protected by a thermal barrier are fire safe {{and the use of}} flame retardants does not provide any additional benefit [ [...] . ] Changing the buildin...|$|R

The regularities of the phase formation and also the change of the structure and micromorphology of the condensated phase on the carbonization and carbidization stages of the syntactic <b>foam</b> <b>plastic</b> with introduced silicon and titanium oxides have been studied and explained by a complex of the physical-chemical methods from positions of the atomic-molecular conceptions. The proposed technology permits to obtain the wide spectrum of the materials with high thermo-mechanical properties.
