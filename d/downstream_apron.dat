Besides examining the hydrodynamics of the stream the study investigated also the distribution of grain size in the bed-load at the upstream and downstream aprons of the structure.

40|$|This study, which {{includes}} both experimental and numerical-modelling components, investigates the potentially dangerous conditions that can often occur when low-head dams (or weirs) are overtopped and ‘submerged’-type hydraulic jumps subsequently form downstream of them. The combination of high local turbulence levels, air entrainment, and strong surface currents associated with submerged jumps pose a significant risk to safety of boaters and swimmers. In this study, {{a wide range}} of flow regimes and different experimental conditions (i. e. crest length and <b>downstream</b> <b>apron</b> elevation) were considered. The experimental phase involved physical model testing to determine: (i) the hydraulic conditions that govern submerged jump formation, and (ii) the hydrodynamic characteristics of the submerged vortex. The numerical model, developed using OpenFOAM, was validated with the obtained experimental data. This research seeks to help develop improved guidelines for the design and safe operation of low-head dams. The experimental phase of the study involved physical model testing to determine: (i) the hydraulic conditions that govern submerged jump formation, and (ii) the hydrodynamic characteristics of the submerged vortex. The numerical modelling work involved using interFoam (OpenFOAM toolbox) for simulating the experimental results. InterFoam is an Eulerian 3 -D solver for multiphase incompressible fluids that employs the Volume of Fluid approach (VOF) to capture the water-air interface. The developed numerical model was subsequently validated using the experimental data collected and processed by the author of this study. The range of tailwater depths associated with submerged hydraulic jump formation is dramatically reduced when a broad-crested weir is coupled with an elevated <b>downstream</b> <b>apron,</b> especially under high flow rate conditions. However sharp-crested weirs induced vortices which displayed reduced velocities and decreased spatial development, which were judged to be safer than broad crest lengths under the same discharge conditions. The classical formulation for the degree of submergence was not explicative when used to evaluate “how submerged the vortex was”. Consequently, a new normalized formulation which compares the local tailwater depth to the lower and upper tailwater limits for the submerged hydraulic jump is proposed. The numerical model developed for this study demonstrated the existence of residual turbulent kinetic energy at downstream sections located within the vortex’s extension, at instants coinciding with the presence of a fully formed roller. This turbulent energy is arguably responsible for the stationary nature of the vortex under constant flow conditions. Residual vertical and horizontal velocities at points located within the vortex’s domain are indicative of the existence of the free surface current...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{on the character}} of flow along an abrupt drop boundary at <b>downstream</b> of an <b>apron</b> are performed. From measurement of velocity distribution, it makes evident that the main flow along an abrupt drop boundary <b>downstream</b> of an <b>apron</b> can be devided in to three regions, accelated, constant and decreased velocity region. The character of main flow, variation of maximum velocity, growth of charactristic width of main flow, non-dimentional eddy viscocity of jet-like main flow and etc, are determined experimentaly. Under the main flow model as decided above, the growth of boundary layer and the coefficient of local skin friction was calculated. The calculated results are good agreement with each experimental results.

40|$|The correct {{design of}} the {{regulator}} structure requires complete prediction of the ultimate dimensions of the scour hole profile formed <b>downstream</b> the solid <b>apron.</b> In the following study a mathematical model is developed to predict the ultimate dimensions of the scour hole profile formed <b>downstream</b> the solid <b>apron</b> of the regulator structure under various operating conditions. These parameters are, the maximum predicted scour depth, its distance from the apron of the regulator, and the total length of the scour hole formed directly <b>downstream</b> the solid <b>apron</b> of the regulator. A laboratory model is built-up to study the long-term scour depth under various operating conditions. Both the long-term scour depth and scour hole profile are measured. The effect of the bed material median diameter is also included. The laboratory results are used in verification of the developed mathematical model resulted from the theoretical study of the problem. It is found that the long-term scour depth depends mainly on the jet diffusion characteristics, Shields parameter, Reynolds number, and densemeteric Froude number.

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of the Plavinas dam, Latvia was {{the subject}} of this final thesis. The objective was to investigate the weaknesses of the Plavinas dam and to present possible stabilising treatments. This includes a rough estimate on costs and construction methods. Plavinas hydroelectric power station is the most important dam in Latvia, supplying 30 % of the countrys power. The Plavinas blocks the runoff of the Daugava River, resulting in the formation of a reservoir. The power plant is a composite type structure consisting of a concrete power house and a spillway, which is located on top of the power house. The water from the reservoir can either flow through ten generating units located in the concrete power house, which is approximately 200 m long, or flow over the power house, the spillway. The head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace measures 40 m. Several kilometres of hydraulically filled embankment dams extend to both sides of the concrete power house. The dam is founded on glacial till overlying a sandstone layer. Drainage wells were incorporated in the foundation of the power house. This drainage system reduces the large uplift water pressures from the head difference between the reservoir level and the tailrace. This results in a larger effective weight of the structure, which is favourable for the bearing capacity of the structure against sliding and toppling. There are indications that the drainage wells, which can not be replaced under the concrete structure, do not function according to specifications: an increase of uplift water pressures is monitored. This could endanger the stability of the power house. transport of fine soil particles with the groundwater flow in the regional aquifer is occurring towards the drainage galleries near the right embankment as well as the drainage system underneath the structure. settlements of the power house have been observed, which seems to be caused by collapsing seepage channels. The power house structure and the aprons were schematised and the normative loading cases were determined. The stability of the structure was calculated for the following situations: original design assumptions in which the uplift water pressure is reduced by approximately 90 % rising water pressures due to continuously less effective original drainage system complete failure of drainage wells without compensating treatments different treatments, increasing the stability of the power house in case the original drainage fails entirely, either by adding more weight to compensate for the larger uplift water pressure or by reducing the uplift pressure by an extension of the seepage path or new drains. The different stabilising treatments were analysed in a multi criteria analysis taking into account amongst others the problem elimination, durability and feasibility of execution. The alternative of new drains in the <b>downstream</b> <b>apron</b> close to the power house provided the best alternative. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{flow from}} the {{rectangular}} opening of the flood detention dam will produce scouring and damage on the <b>downstream</b> <b>aprons.</b> While {{the water from the}} rectangular opening flow on the concret apron, the fan-like flow decentralizes around and scours both side of the riverbank. The refractive circumfluence produced from the both side of the riverbank will meet with the flow without being effected by the riverbank, and both of them form the turbulent curve. On the downstream of the dam we place concret apron in the central part and the Hexa- Hollow Tri-Leg Structure near the riverbank. This study discusses the effectiveness of energy dissipation and the effect what the Hexa-Hollow Tri-Leg Structure does to the turbulent curve under different slopes,discharges and widths of the rectangular opening in the case of having not deposited yet on the upstream of the dam. In this research, we find that the effectiveness of energy dissipation of apron will increase with the increasing of slop and discharge, but will decrease with the increasing of width of the rectangular opening. According to the type of the Hexa-Hollow Tri-Leg Structure being arranged,the longer the length of Hexa- Hollow Tri-Leg Structure is and the better the effectiveness of energy dissipation is. The length of turbulent curve will decrease with the increasing of the width of the Hexa-Hollow Tri-Leg Structure. In this research,we find that the Hexa-Hollow Tri-Leg Structure being arranged beside the both riverbank downstream the dam has its efficiency on shortening the turbulent curve and the effectiveness of energy dissipation. When applying to the field, it must be a good choice. 中文摘要 滯洪壩水舌呈豎一字形，勢必對下游護坦產生沖刷與 破壞。且沖射 流作用在水泥護坦上時，其扇形水流向四周 分散，對河床兩岸進行沖擊 ，產生折射迴流；並與未受兩 岸邊壁影響之水流交會，形成明顯擾動曲 線。 本試驗於滯洪壩下游，除舖設水泥護坦外，並於兩側 配合人工預鑄元鼎塊之舖設；探討於不同渠床坡度、流量 、矩形開口及 壩未淤滿前之情形下，元鼎塊對擾動曲線之 影響及消能效果。 經試驗得知，護坦的消能效果隨流量，坡度增加而增 加，而隨矩形 開口寬度之增加而減小。就元鼎塊排列方式 而言，在本試驗之元鼎塊長 度範圍下，元鼎塊長度愈長， 消能效果愈差；元鼎塊寬度愈寬，水流所 產生的擾動曲線 長度愈短。 在本試驗條件下，壩下游兩側舖設元鼎塊確有其縮短 擾動區域及消 能的功效；因此在現場應用上，應為一良好 之選擇...|$|R
40|$|US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District (CENWP) {{operates}} the Bonneville Lock and Dam Project on the Columbia River. High spill flows {{that occurred during}} 2011 moved a large volume of rock from downstream of the spillway apron to the stilling basin and apron. Although 400 cubic yards of rocks {{were removed from the}} stilling basin, there are still large volumes of rock <b>downstream</b> of the <b>apron</b> that could, under certain flow conditions, move upstream into the stilling basin. CENWP is investigating operational changes that could be implemented to minimize future movement of rock into the stilling basin. A key analysis tool to develop these operational changes is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the spillway. A free-surface CFD model of the Bonneville spillway tailrace was developed and applied for four flow scenarios. These scenarios looked at the impact of flow volume and flow distribution on tailrace hydraulics. The simulation results showed that areas of upstream flow existed near the river bed <b>downstream</b> of the <b>apron,</b> on the apron, and within the stilling basin for all flows. For spill flows of 300 kcfs, the cross-stream and downstream extent of the recirculation zones along Cascade and Bradford Island was very dependent on the spill pattern. The center-loaded pattern had much larger recirculation zones than the flat or bi-modal pattern. The lower flow (200 kcfs) with a flat pattern had a very large recirculation zone that extended half way across the channel near the river bed. A single flow scenario (300 kcfs of flow in a relatively flat spill pattern) was further interrogated using Lagrangian particle tracking. The tracked particles (with size and mass) showed the upstream movement of sediments onto the concrete apron and against the vertical wall between the apron and the stilling basin from seed locations <b>downstream</b> of the <b>apron</b> and on the apron...|$|R
40|$|Velocity and {{turbulence}} measurements downstream of a sill {{followed by}} a rigid apron were performed. Three runs were conducted at different scouring stages: flat bed, 50 % of the maximum scour depth and 100 % of the maximum scour depth. For all the scouring stages, the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity compo-nent, measured over the rigid apron, {{was found to be}} similar to a wall jet. When the bed is flat, the wall jet ve-locity distribution changes into a free surface velocity distribution, as the distance from the apron increases. When a scour hole develops <b>downstream</b> of the <b>apron,</b> the wall jet velocity distribution changes into an “asymmetric free jet” velocity distribution, till the abscissa of the maximum scour depth. Turbulence intensi-ties, along both the vertical and the horizontal axis, were found to decrease as the distance from the sill in-creased, for all the scouring stages. A similar behavior was observed for dimensionless Reynolds stresses over a flat bed.

40|$|Bed {{protection}} in <b>apron</b> <b>downstream</b> was installed to use riprap or gabion mattress. In {{the case of}} bed pro-tect- tion using riprap, the decision on the riprap diameter is very important because riprap diameter means the capacity to withstand the flow. Initial formulas for the decision on the riprap diameter applied velocity and weight as main factors. Since the main factors gradually expanded to depth, bed slope, and turbulence intensity, decision formulas for the riprap diameter were detailed. Because turbulence intensity was consid-ered to be a main factor of the formula, the decision formulas for the riprap diameter could be expanded to apply to bed protection around hydraulic structures. Escarameia and May conducted {{a study on the}} riprap diameter of a strong turbulence area around the downstream of hydraulic structures. For the formula of Es-carameia and May, the basis of the formula was the Izbash type, and the main factor was turbulence intensity.

Between 1984 and 1986 a program of cement grouting works was undertaken at the barrage, though there are no records of the head regulator receiving similar treatment.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the mechanics of scour downstream of a culvert and anoutlet and to discuss the method for preventing from scour, it is necessary, firstof all, to analyze the characters of flow close to a bed, especially the boundarylayer developing there. The {{first part of this}} paper, therefore, presents an analysisof the boundary layer growth in a wall jet issuing from a submerged outlet, basedon the momentum equation for a boundary layer connecting with two-dimensionalfree turbulent jets.

This paper considers first the hysteresis effects in transient flows between discharge, velocity, and bottom shear stress. These effects can be taken into account as far as the complete shallow-water equations are used. Secondly, inertia effects linked to the sediment response to acting forces are considered. Three types of models are investigated: (i) sediment movement instantaneously adapting to hydrodynamic changes, (ii) spatial or temporal lag laws to give space or time to the sediments to progressively reach the transport capacity, and (iii) a two-layer model, able to account for the inertia of the sediment layer. Finally, three examples are presented: a scour hole <b>downstream</b> of an <b>apron,</b> a jump over a mobile bed, and a dam-break wave.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Stepped spillways {{constructed}} of roller compacted concrete (RCC) is a hydraulic and cost effective measure to dissipate energy of large water flows over the spillway of a dam. Stepped spillways, like other spillway types, have its limitations and {{a measure to}} improve the energy dissipation effectiveness is proposed. Two hydraulic models were constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) in Pretoria, South Africa. The scales of the models were 1 : 20 and 1 : 30. The study proposes the use of triangular protrusions applied over the spillway surface. The protrusions have the same height as the steps, with {{the width of the}} protrusions varying. The triangular protrusions deflect the water sideways resulting in higher energy losses. The results indicate that the protrusions reduce scouring at the toe of the dam, thus increasing the roughness of the steps. It also indicate that aeration occur earlier than with normal stepped spillways. An optimal spacing, lateral and across the steps, are proposed. The construction of the protrusions is also discussed, as well as the cost implications. It is concluded that the protrusions are effective at a unit discharge up to 35 m 3 /s. m. This value is however dependent on the configuration of the <b>apron</b> <b>downstream</b> of the toe of the dam. It is proposed that protrusions be added on the downstream face of the dam on every second step, with one protrusion and then no protrusion alternating in the flow path. It is recommended that the protrusions be cast in situ...|$|R
40|$|Using energy dissipaters on the soled <b>aprons</b> <b>downstream</b> of head {{structures}} is {{the main}} technique for accelerating hydraulic jump formation and dissipating {{a great amount of}} the residual harmful kinetic energy occurring downstream of head structures. In this paper, an experimental study was conducted to investigate some untested shapes of curved dissipaters with different angles of curvature and arrangements from two points of view. The first is to examine its efficiency in dissipating the kinetic water energy. The second is to examine the most effective shape and arrangement obtained from the aforementioned step in enriching the flow with dissolved oxygen for enhancement of the irrigation water quality. The study was held in the irrigation and hydraulic laboratory of the Civil Department, Faculty of Engineering, Assiut University, using a movable bed tilting channel 20 m long, 30 cm wide, and 50 cm high, using 21 types of curved dissipaters with different arrangements. A total of 660 runs were carried out. Results were analysed, tabulated and graphically presented, and new formulas were introduced to estimate the energy dissipation ratio, as well as the DO concentrations. Results in general showed that the dissipater performance is more tangible in dissipating the residual energy when the curvature is in the opposite direction to that of the flow. Also, the energy loss ratio increases with an increase in curvature angle (θ), until it reaches (θ = 120 °), then it decreases again. The study also showed that using three rows of dissipaters give nearly the same effect as using four rows, concerning both the relative energy dissipation and dissolved oxygen content. So, it is recommended to use three rows of the curved dissipater with the angle of curvature (θ = 120 °) in the opposite direction to that of the flow to obtain the maximum percentage of water energy dissipation downstream of head structures, and maximum dissolved oxygen content to...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{sediment}} transport {{has been studied}} extensively in the past decades, not all physical processes involved are yet well understood and represented. This results in a modeling deficiency in that few models include complete and detailed descriptions of the necessary physical processes and in that models that do usually focus on the specific case of sheet flows. We seek to address this modeling issue by developing a model that would describe appropriately the physics and would not only focus on sheet flows. To that end, we employ a two-phase approach, for which concentration-weighted averaged equations of motion are solved for a sediment and a fluid phase. The two phases are assumed to only interact through drag forces. The correlations between fluctuating quantities are modeled using the turbulent viscosity and the gradient diffusion hypotheses. The fluid turbulent stresses are calculated using a modified k-epsilon model that accounts for the two-way particle-turbulence interaction, and the sediment stresses are calculated using a collisional granular flow theory. This approach is used to study three different problems: dilute flow modeling, sheet flows and scouring. In dilute models sediment stresses are neglected. Near bed processes are instead modeled through the bottom boundary conditions and we consider and compare two widely used approaches. We also introduce and validate a concentration dependent Schmidt number. The sheet flow model is validated for different flow conditions. Several well-known results and formulae are confirmed such as reduced turbulence in the diluted region, the bed load layer thickness and the dependence of the {{sediment transport}} rate on the Shields parameter. It also provides a counterexample to modeling the bed shear stress in phase with the free stream velocity. Finally, it provides information on the vertical sediment flux, {{which could be used}} to model the bottom boundary condition in dilute models. The two-phase model is also shown to be able to represent two-dimensional sediment transport issues. A simple benchmark test case (scouring <b>downstream</b> of an <b>apron)</b> is performed and results are found to reproduce reasonably well existing experimental data. Future work on sediment transport modeling is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|After {{the annual}} {{maintenance}} period {{and during the}} refilling of the canal downstream of a regulator the tail water depth of this canal is small and not sufficient to produce a hydraulic jump inside the solid apron. This results in a severe local scour problem for the canal bed. A traditional solution of this problem is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method has not {{proved to be a}} permanent solution. To investigate this local scour problem a physical model for a one vent regulator was constructed and a non-uniform granular material was used to simulate the canal bed. This experimental studies revealed that there are five distinct flow regimes in the region of the scour hole, namely: (1) a jet attached to the bed, (2) breaking wave and adverse hydraulic jump, (3) a travelling hydraulic jump, (4) wave jump and diving jet, and (5) surface jet with entrainment from below. The initial tests produced an asymmetrical scour hole; however, a midstream flow divider or vane, made the scour hole more symmetrical. Two depressions were observed inside most of the symmetrical scour holes. It was found that the scour hole that forms immediately after the apron, which {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour, reaches an equilibrium depth within a few minutes of the start of flow while the scour hole formed farther from the apron (long-term scour) continues to increase, at a decreasing rate for several days. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is caused mainly by the attached jet while the short-term scour in a trapezoidal channel is produced by the jet attachment and the drilling effect of the vertical vortices caused by the sudden enlargement at the end of the control structure. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is found to be a function of the initial Froude number, the initial jet depth and the particle size. The long-term scour depth is caused by the wave jet or diving jet as well as the surface jet; the scour depth was found to be a function of time, densimetric Froude number, initial jet depth and particle size. The changes in the surficial size distribution and settling velocity were determined for short-term and long-term scour at various locations within and downstream of the scour hole. The Gumbel distribution yields a good fit to both fall diameter and mass based equivalent diameter particle frequency distribution. As the scour hole develops, the D 50 decreases as does the ratio D 90 /D 10. An unsteady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole pattern and duration of phase 1 (attached jet). This model verified the rapid development of the short-term scour depth and reflected the observed effects of head, flow, and grain size. A steady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole dimensions immediately <b>downstream</b> of the <b>apron.</b> This model confirmed that the short-term scour depth is mainly a function of the initial Froude number, and initial jet depth, although it was found to be weakly dependent on the particle size. A theoretical consideration for the maximum long-term scour depth supports the concept that this depth is dependent on the densimetric Froude number, the jet expansion characteristics and the Shields constant.
