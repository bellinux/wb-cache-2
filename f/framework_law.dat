A notable strategy of the framework is to reduce poverty through proper {{management of water resources}} and by promoting sustainable development. The framework also decentralized management of water away from SANNA to the municipalities.|$|E

Thus, local regulatory agencies were created for the concession contracts to secure a sustained process. For instance, in Puerto Cortés a regulatory agency was created at the municipal level including selected representatives of civil society, such as doctors, engineers and lawyers.|$|E

The EIB has supported water supply and sanitation projects in six cities (Marrakech, Settat, Meknes, Agadir, Oujda and Fes), {{as well as a number}} of small towns. Between 1997 and 2006 it provided 10 loans totaling Euro 283m. In 2006 it approved another loan of Euro 40m for sanitation in the Sebou basin, a highly polluted river where Fes and Meknes are located. In 2002 the European Union provided a Euro 120m grant to support the first water sector adjustment program to Morocco, which aimed at rationalizing water resources management. The program's specific objectives were to effectively implement the 1995 Water <b>Framework</b> <b>Law,</b> to reduce the costs for the state budget and to increase the effectiveness of the sector institutions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, the Law on Using National Waters (Ley Vigente de Aprovechamiento de Aguas Nacionales) {{was passed}} to approve {{measures}} addressing water use, irrigation, industrial use, and hydropower. Furthermore, the 1927 law {{marked the beginning}} of policy measures designed specifically to manage water resources—albeit not yet integrating sectoral policies. Around 1957, Honduras was mostly under military rule until a freely elected government came to power in 1982. It is unclear how military rule sought to manage water resources during this period. The next major water resources policy measures were signed in 2003 as the Water <b>Framework</b> <b>Law</b> which, among many aspects, aims to reduce poverty through better water resources management. In August 2009, a new General Water Law was passed to replace the 1927 water law. Within the new water law a National Water Authority was created to oversee the work of sector institutions[...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) {{approved}} {{an important}} US$ 71 million loan {{to consolidate the}} reform and modernization {{of the water and}} sanitation sector. The loan foresaw the financing of investments by INAPA and regional companies, as well as substantial technical assistance. Specifically, it aimed at transforming the five regional water companies outside the capital into commercially operated entities with no political interference in day-to-day management and strong representation of municipalities and civil society in their Boards. The reform was based on the model of CORAASAN. In the case of CORAAMOCA and COAAROM, management contracts with private operators were to be signed. INAPA was to be gradually decentralized into autonomous regional units, and services in rural areas were to be gradually transferred to user associations. [...] A condition for the effectiveness of the loan was the passing by Congress of a water and sanitation <b>framework</b> <b>law</b> that would have established a central government agency (ente rector) in charge of the sector as well as a water and sanitation regulatory agency.|$|E

2500|$|The first PQ {{government}} {{was known as}} the [...] "republic of professors" [...] because of the large number of scholars who served as cabinet members. The PQ was the first government to recognize the rights of Aboriginal peoples to self-determination, insofar as this self-determination did not affect the territorial integrity of Quebec. The PQ passed laws on public consultations and the financing of political parties, which ensured equal financing of political parties and limited contributions by individuals to $3000. However, the most prominent legacy of the PQ is the Charter of the French Language (the Bill 101), a <b>framework</b> <b>law</b> which defines the linguistic primacy of French and seeks to make French the common public language of Quebec. It allowed the advancement of francophones towards management roles, until then largely out of their reach– despite the fact that 85% of the population spoke French and most of them did not understand English, the language of management was English in most medium and large businesses. [...] Critics, both Francophone and Anglophone, have however criticized the charter for restraining citizens' linguistic school choice, as it forbids immigrants and Quebecers of French descent from attending English-language schools funded by the state (private schools remained an option for those who could afford tuition). [...] The Parti Québécois initiated the 1980 Quebec referendum seeking a mandate to begin negotiation for sovereignty-association. It was rejected by 60 per cent of voters.|$|E

40|$|With the precautionary {{principle}} having growing {{success in the}} international legal order, several national legislators in Europe have followed its success by increasingly setting {{it out in the}} recitals of environmental codes of <b>law</b> or in <b>framework</b> <b>laws.</b> In German law, the principle has for some time now implicitly followed on from sectoral laws relating to listed installations, biotechnology, nuclear energy and water management. In France and in Belgium, it has been introduced more recently by <b>framework</b> <b>laws</b> which initiated the codification of environmental law. When looking for substantive indications of its existence, one finds that the principle is more clearly present in national legal regimes than one might think. By giving increasing importance to uncertainty, several legislative systems have already brought the principle into play without expressly referring to it. The doctrine acknowledges that national biotechnology laws represent one of its most important advances. It is, however, at the level of litigation that the principle has been most successful. As will be demonstrated by discussing case law from Germany, France and Belgium, some legal regimes have already made a breakthrough by integrating uncertainty into their reasoning, thus applying the {{precautionary principle}} without necessarily being aware of it. Since the objective of the principle is to govern decision making under conditions of uncertainty in an all-encompassing manner, the principle is also advancing, in a perhaps more striking manner, in other fields of law, such as health law...|$|R
