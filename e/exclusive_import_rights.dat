50|$|NV Spemotri was BMW's main {{importer}} of motorcycles {{during the}} 1950s; they mainly {{brought in the}} two-cylinder R25, R26, and R27. A handful of BMW 700s were imported to Indonesia by NV Spemotri in the early 1960s; the Salim Group held the <b>import</b> <b>rights</b> until they sold the tiny concession to the Astra Group in the late 1970s. The first BMW to be assembled locally was the 520/4, which was sent CKD and built in Jakarta by PT Indonesia Service Coy. 780 E12 was assembled from 1976 until 1981, with the 520/6 replacing the four-cylinder in 1978. Indonesia Service Coy later built the E28, E30, E36, and E34 models, until assembly {{was taken over by}} the PT Gaya Motor company in 1993.

5000|$|Rosenthal also {{headed the}} process of {{adjudication}} of <b>import</b> <b>rights</b> of oil products into the country. This process was adjudicated in 2006 to ConocoPhillips.

This process which Rosenthal has led with other officials close to President Zelaya has been under constant criticism from the private sector in Honduras, {{as well as from the}} government of the United States. [...] ConocoPhilips, despite winning the monopoly <b>rights</b> of <b>importing</b> oil in the country, lacks storage facilities. Chevron, Exxon and Shell have refused to lease to ConnocoPhillips or the Government their respective facilities. After this refusal President Zelaya pushed for an executive mandate to force multinational companies to lease their facilities under a price point set by the government.|$|R
50|$|The 1998 Accord {{was also}} {{assembled}} in New Zealand {{at the very}} end of overall CKD car production due to the abolition of import tariffs on built cars which made local assembly uneconomic. 1,200 examples of the car (the mid-sized U.S. sedan version) were built before the Honda New Zealand factory was closed; the very first Honda-owned factory operation to be closed down) and the equipment (which included a paint shop acquired from Nissan when that automaker closed its Australian manufacturing unit in 1994) was shipped to other Honda assembly units, mainly in Asia. Small numbers of Accords were <b>imported</b> (<b>right</b> hand drive) from the U.S. before sourcing switched to Thailand once Accord assembly began there.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the potential trade distortion effects of {{state trading enterprises}} (STEs) on soybean imports to Korea. Traditionally, STEs have exercised <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to <b>import</b> the so-called strategic products, to ensure food security, domestic price stabilization, and import mark-ups. However, STE imports have been criticized {{on the grounds that}} industries using soybeans as a raw material are unable to obtain a diverse mix of quality material and cannot exercise the right to choose their own ingredients. Under a theoretical framework, a tariff equivalent of the STE is postulated to equate imports by private firms with imports by the STE. An empirical model is constructed and estimated using annual data spanning 1980 - 2009. The estimated results show that providing <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> to <b>imports</b> has a negative effect on market access. When the STE pursues consumer welfare, the import-reducing effect turns out to be smaller than that in the producer welfare maximization case...|$|R
30|$|Natural gas is {{expected}} to play a much more important role in China in future decades, and market reform is crucial for its rapid market penetration. At present, the main gas fields, pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure are mainly monopolized by large state-owned companies, {{and one of the}} important market reform policies is to open up LNG <b>import</b> <b>rights</b> to smaller private companies and traders. Therefore, in the present study, a game theoretical model is proposed to analyze and compare the impacts of different market structures on infrastructure deployment and social welfare. Moreover, a support vector machine-based rolling horizon stochastic method is adopted in the model to simulate real LNG price fluctuations. Four market reform scenarios are proposed considering different policies such as business separation, third-party access (TPA) and their combinations. The results indicate that, with third-party access (TPA) entrance into the LNG market, the construction of LNG infrastructure will be promoted and more gas will be provided at lower prices, and thus the total social welfare will be improved greatly.|$|R
40|$|WP 02 / 2004; In {{recent years}} changes of {{regulation}} in European electricity industry have been oriented towards a gradual liberalization of the sector, stressing {{the issue of}} energy provision for selling in the open market. Within the Italian regulatory framework, since local public firms cannot compete against other bigger operators in auctions for energy Cip 6 / 92 and for the <b>import</b> <b>rights,</b> they have addressed themselves towards upstream integration, i. e. in the generation stage. In this study we analyze the cost efficiency of vertical integration, by estimating a translog multiproduct cost function for a sample of 14 local electric utilities operating in both generation and distribution during the period 1994 - 2000. The empirical evidence suggests the presence of widespread cost complementarities between the two stages and points to vertical integration as a crucial success factor for local public firms. Thanks to the cost savings it enables, vertical integration allows electric local utilities to reach both the minimum production capacity and the efficiency that are required {{to compete in the}} open market...|$|R
