5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for <b>easy</b> <b>removal.</b> All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E
25|$|Easier to control. A molten fuel reactor has the {{advantage}} of <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of xenon-135. Xenon-135, an important neutron absorber, makes solid fueled reactors difficult to control. In a molten fueled reactor, xenon-135 can be removed. In solid-fuel reactors, xenon-135 remains in the fuel and interferes with reactor control.|$|E
25|$|The Type 36 is {{a direct}} clone of the M3A1, {{manufactured}} in 1947 at the Shenyang Arsenal in Mukden. It resembles a M3A1, except {{that it has no}} flats to allow the use of a wrench for <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> and it has no oil bottle trap in the pistol grip. Its parts are not interchangeable with the M3A1.|$|E
30|$|In this {{research}} we observed a limited osseointegration of this hardware, probably allowing, when necessary, an <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> {{of the plate}} {{with respect to the}} other routinely used materials.|$|R
50|$|Fruit Roll-Ups is a {{brand of}} fruit snack that debuted in grocery stores across the United States in 1983. The snack is a flat, pectin-based fruit-flavored snack, wrapped around a piece of {{cellophane}} for <b>easier</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Number of {{vertical}} (warp) and horizontal (woof) threads per square inch. These threads vary from 120 to 150 per square inch. A higher thread count {{is synonymous with}} a higher quality including higher tensile strength, better adhesive, <b>easier</b> <b>removal,</b> longer lasting, and more expensive.|$|R
25|$|The most-resistant {{organism}} (MRO) to sterilization with NO2 gas is the spore of Geobacillus stearothermophilus, {{which is}} the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of G. stearothermophilus has been well characterized over the years as a biological indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of G. stearothermophilus with NO2 gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical devices at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility. This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer’s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residuals through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop {{in place of the}} sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached {{to the rear of the}} nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for <b>easy</b> <b>removal,</b> a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E
500|$|The gondola, {{constructed}} of nickel-steel tubing, was suspended some [...] below an elliptical steel frame (or keel) {{attached to the}} bottom of the gas-bag, under the centre of lift. Between the frame and the envelope and linking the two was a small hemp net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and the frame was attached to the net by further toggles. This permitted the <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of the frame from the envelope. The frame itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport.|$|E
40|$|Glass ionomer/composite bite blocks {{are used}} {{routinely}} for unraveling the interferences caused by occlusion/as splints.

500|$|In orthodontics, small {{diameter}} dental implants, {{referred to}} as Temporary Anchorage Devices (or TADs) can assist tooth movement by creating anchor points from which forces can be generated. [...] For teeth to move, a force must be applied {{to them in the}} direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> following treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Carpet tiles {{are also}} available, {{typically}} [...] square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> (in an office environment, for example) or to allow rearrangement {{in order to}} spread wear.|$|E
2500|$|Kiniski also {{wrestled}} {{for several}} months in 1970 and 1971 as a masked wrestler, [...] "The Crimson Knight", on local TV (KPLR-TV) matches in St. Louis, Missouri. The storyline continued through numerous attempts to unmask the Knight (his mask was sewn onto his tights, making an <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> impossible) before he was finally unmasked and revealed to be Kiniski.|$|E
5000|$|Magpul: Magpul's {{first and}} eponymously named product {{was a simple}} soft polymer sleeve based on the [...] "paracord loops" [...] that {{experienced}} soldiers fabricated and taped to their magazines to allow for <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> from magazine pouches. The original magpul fit over STANAG magazines, and allowed for operators to easily grasp and draw magazines from pouches and webbing under stress.|$|R
50|$|Clays {{should be}} {{separated}} from the nonclay minerals to reduce interference of 00l peaks. Nonclay minerals can usually be separated by sieving samples at a small enough mesh. Samples should be lightly crushed but not pulverized because nonclay minerals will be reduced to clay sizes and become impossible to separate from the sample. Lightly crushing breaks apart the soft clays while keeping harder nonclays intact for <b>easier</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sometimes bumps or in-grown hair {{can result}} from waxing. Isolated hairs can be removed with {{tweezers}} or electrolysis. Discomfort following the procedure generally lasts two to five days or less. Application of egg oil {{for a few days}} post-waxing can help moisturize the skin and reduce inflammation, pain or growth of bacteria. With repeated removal over time, pubic hair becomes weaker and grows more slowly, leading to <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> with less pain and less frequent waxing.|$|R
2500|$|When {{demolishing}} a structure, {{dimension stone}} is 100% reusable {{and can be}} salvaged for new construction, used as paving or crushed for use as aggregates. [...] There are also [...] "green" [...] methods of stone cleaning either in development or already in use, such as removing the black gypsum crusts that form on marble and limestone by applying sulfate-reducing bacteria to the crust to gasify it, breaking up the crust for <b>easy</b> <b>removal.</b> See DSAN for updates on [...] "building green" [...] and dimension stone recycling.|$|E
2500|$|Depleted UO2 (DUO2) {{can be used}} as a {{material}} for radiation shielding. For example, DUCRETE is a [...] "heavy concrete" [...] material where gravel is replaced with uranium dioxide aggregate; this material is investigated for use for casks for radioactive waste. Casks can be also made of DUO2-steel cermet, a composite material made of an aggregate of uranium dioxide serving as radiation shielding, graphite and/or silicon carbide serving as neutron radiation absorber and moderator, and steel as the matrix, whose high thermal conductivity allows <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of decay heat.|$|E
2500|$|Kamerman {{said that}} these ships were {{designed}} to [...] "take punishment" [...] {{and that they were}} designed for inherent growth. They have spaces with all the necessary fittings for rapid fitting of additional equipment without needing modifications. This means that the frigates could increase their surface-to-air missile capabilities from 16 launch cells up to 32 launch cells in a relatively few hours. It is expected that this class of frigates will be substantially upgraded over the warships’ 30 to 40 year operational lifetimes. Kamerman has said that the ships had plenty of space to accommodate new equipment and new weapons, and that they were designed to allow for <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of outdated equipment through readily-accessible hatches.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, due {{to issues}} {{concerning}} chest and back ventilation {{caused by the}} non-breathable fabrics incorporated, the tactical load carrying vest was redesigned, and officially redesignated the ETLBV. No changes to the National Stock Number have been made. The two major modifications have been the slant of the magazine pouches inward, for <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> of small arms magazines, and the exchange of the fabric panels, which retained body heat, both situated {{on the front and}} back, with lighter mesh panels.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 Smart Parts {{released}} {{an updated version}} of the ion called the ION XE, that includes built in B.O.B (bolt out back) function, which allows <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> of the bolt. This makes maintenance considerably easier, as one must only take out a single screw as opposed to taking apart the entire marker. This was one of the major criticisms of the original Ions. The new Ion XE also consists of a new and improved low profile feedneck and a new body design. Ion XE colored bodies are available.|$|R
5000|$|Fifty Class 19C {{locomotives}} entered {{service in}} 1935, built by NBL {{to the design}} of the Class 19B, but with Rotary Cam Poppet valve gear and Watson Standard no. 1A boilers. It had a larger superheater than the Class 19B and was equipped with a Watson cab with a sloping front that, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes. In a break with prior custom, the ash pan and running boards were affixed to the locomotive frame instead of to the boiler to facilitate <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> of the boiler for repairs.|$|R
2500|$|Currently a {{complete}} {{renovation of the}} New Haven rail yard is being planned in conjunction will the new M8 rail cars that have been purchased. In October 2009 O Industries of Torrington placed a bid for $124.8 million {{to build a new}} [...] maintenance facility. The contract was then awarded on December 11, 2009. Start Date was January 25, 2010. This will be the main repair shop for the electric multiple unit cars, with 13 car spots on three tracks, overhead cranes and floor lifts to allow <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of major car components, and a DC Power system. The new facility will also include support shops to store, repair and maintain the major components, with a parts storage area. There will be a second floor which will contain offices and amenities/facilities for Metro-North employees. The upper floors will also contain a training center with simulators a security center and offices for DOT employees and MTA Police officers.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system is}} the bucket toilet, {{consisting}} of a seat and a portable receptacle (bucket or pail). These may be emptied by their owners into composting piles in the garden (a low-tech composting toilet), or collected by contractors for larger-scale disposal. Historically, this {{was known as the}} pail closet; the municipality employed workers, often known as [...] "nightmen" [...] (from night soil), to empty and replace the buckets. This system was associated in particular with the English town of Rochdale, {{to the extent that it}} was described as the [...] "Rochdale System" [...] of sanitation. 20th century books report that similar systems were in operation in parts of France and elsewhere in continental Europe. The system of municipal collection was widespread in Australia; [...] "dunny cans" [...] persisted well into the second half of the twentieth century, see below. In Scandinavia and some other countries, outhouses are built over removable containers that enable <b>easy</b> <b>removal</b> of the waste and enable much more rapid composting in separate piles. A similar system operates in India, where hundreds of thousands of workers engage in manual scavenging, i.e. emptying pit latrines and bucket toilets without any personal protective equipment.|$|E

50|$|De-icing {{is defined}} as removal of {{existing}} snow, ice or frost from a roadway, airport runway, or other surface. It includes both mechanical means, such as plowing or scraping, and chemical means, such as application of salt or other ice-melting chemicals. Anti-icing is treatment with ice-melting chemicals before or during the onset of a storm {{in order to prevent}} or delay the formation and adhesion of ice and snow to the surface. Brine, or wetted salt, is usually applied shortly before the beginning of a snowstorm. When properly performed, anti-icing can significantly reduce the amount of salt required and allow <b>easier</b> <b>removal</b> by mechanical methods, including plowing.|$|R
