50|$|Intuitively, smooth infinitesimal {{analysis}} {{can be interpreted}} as describing a world in which lines are made out of infinitesimally small segments, not out of points. These segments {{can be thought of as}} being long enough to have a definite direction, but not long enough to be curved. The construction of discontinuous functions fails because a function is identified with a curve, and the curve cannot be constructed pointwise. We can imagine the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorem's</b> failure as resulting from the ability of an infinitesimal segment to straddle a line. Similarly, the Banach-Tarski paradox fails because a volume cannot be taken apart into points.|$|R

25|$|In one dimension, Sperner's Lemma can be {{regarded}} as a discrete version of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorem.</b> In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} program of Reverse Mathematics uses these formalizations of mathematics in second-order arithmetic {{to study the}} set-existence axioms required to prove mathematical theorems (Simpson 2009, p.32). For example, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorem</b> for functions from the reals to the reals is provable in RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p.87), while the Bolzano/Weierstrass theorem is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p.34).|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that fixed point theory in {{partially}} ordered metric spaces {{as one of the most}} important tools of nonlinear analysis has been widely applied to matrix equations (for more details, see [1] and the references therein), ordinary differential equations (for more details, see [2, 3, 6] and [7] and the references therein), fuzzy differential equations (for more details, see [5] and the references therein), integral equations (for more details, see [8] and [9] and the references therein) and <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorems</b> (for more details, see [10] and the references therein).

40|$|Kumaraswamy Vela Velupillai 74 {{presents}} a constructivist {{perspective on the}} foundations of mathematical economics, praising the views of Feynman in developing path integrals and Dirac in developing the delta function. He sees their approach as consistent with the Bishop constructive mathematics and considers its view on the Bolzano-Weierstrass, Hahn-Banach, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorems,</b> and then {{the implications of these}} arguments for such "crown jewels" of mathematical economics as the existence of general equilibrium and the second welfare theorem. He also relates these ideas to the weakening of certain assumptions to allow for more general results as shown by Rosser 51 in his extension of Gödel's incompleteness theorem in his opening section. This paper considers these arguments in reverse order, moving from the matters of economics applications to the broader issue of constructivist mathematics, concluding by considering the views of Rosser on these matters, drawing both on his writings and on personal conversations with him.

25|$|The non-real {{roots of}} a real {{polynomial}} with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorem</b> {{at least one of}} the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.|$|E
25|$|A prototypical question, posed at {{a global}} level, is whether some {{polynomial}} equation has a solution in F. If {{this is the}} case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The local-global principle or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of F, which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as <b>intermediate</b> <b>value</b> <b>theorem</b> at the archimedean places and p-adic analysis at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where local class field theory is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related {{to the fact that}} the Galois groups of the completions Fv can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of Q are far less understood.|$|E
