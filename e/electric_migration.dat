40|$|The {{current work}} is devoted {{entirely to the}} study of passive {{transport}} phenomena, or more specifically, the more simple diffusion, <b>electric</b> <b>migration</b> and filtration of solute matter and water over glomerular and peritoneal capillary walls. The driving forces behind such trans-capillary transport phenomena have long been assumed to be simple gradients of concentration, hydrostatic pressure and electric potential. Despite decades of research, the relative importance of these different transport mechanisms remains a highly controversial subject. In Study I we explore the subject of charge selectivity in the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB). The results {{of this study indicate that}} electrical charge may be of less importance in the hindrance of charged molecules in the GFB than previously thought. In Study II, we construct a distributed two-pore model and use it to analyze experimental data (θ vs. SE-radius). The results indicate that the wide distribution obtained in the data analysis may be due to a variation in solute size rather than a true variation in pore size. In addition, several theoretical results are presented such as Poiseuille’s law for a distributed pore population. Study III: One of the many unresolved questions regarding the GFB is the reason behind the marked difference in permeability between albumin and Ficoll. In this study, the distributed two-pore model is extended by introducing size distributions on the solute molecules. Experimental data from the rat glomerulus and from precision-made nanopore membranes are analyzed. We show that a variation of only 16 % in the size of the solute molecule is sufficient to explain the difference in permeability between albumin and Ficoll. Study IV: The three-pore model is a widely applied model of peritoneal dialysis. Here an extended version of the classical model is used to optimize automated peritoneal dialysis for a wide range of different scenarios.

40|$|The redox cycling {{can achieve}} in thin layer cell because {{products}} of electrode reactions diffuse {{in opposite directions}} across the thin layer to the electrodes where they can react again. This redox cycling can enhance the current, and hence improve the sensitivity and selectivity. The redox cycling can make the current be under steady state in thin layer electrolysis. The aim of this thesis is to get controlling factors of redox cycling in electrolysis of water. the factors include not only on distance between two electrodes, {{but also on the}} diffusion and <b>electric</b> <b>migration</b> of ions. 	Introduction is firstly devoted to the advantages and applications of micro reactors. Then the history, solution, material of electrodes and cell of electrolysis of water are described. Redox cycling can be observed in the thin layer cell. This is described in chapter 1. The experimental procedures are stated in Chapter 2. 	Chapter 3 is devoted to electrolysis of pure water at parallel platinum electrodes of which distance less than 100 μm. The relation between the electrolysis potential and current was obtained through linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) in 0. 1 M NaClO 4 aqueous solution on the assumption that there was no solution resistance. It obeyed the Tafel equation, which represented the electrode kinetic overpotential. When this kinetic overpotential was eliminated from the current-voltage curve of electrolysis, the potential drop should be caused by solution resistance. The resistivity of pure water was calculated from the potential difference at same current values. It increased with an increase in the distance between the electrodes. The value was however, much smaller than the conventional concept of pure water resistivity 18. 2 MΩcm. This was because generation and accumulation of hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion before the recombination reaction. The increase in the chronoamperometric current was due to the redox cycling of products after electrolysis. The square of distance was proportional to 	the time which got from the current-time curve. The slope of the proportionality implied the diffusion coefficient of the product. This value was consistent with result calculated by Stokes-Einstein equation at 25 ℃ in water. In order to understand the above behavior, we calculated concentration profiles of the ions and potential distribution in the cell on basis of the Nernst-Plank equation including dissociation kinetics of water. 	Chapter 4 deals with the mechanism of electrolyzing pure water, with the hydrogen gas or ion. The solution resistance without ion should be very large. Nevertheless, when hydrogen gas was deliberately added to pure water without any supporting electrolyte, the sigmoidal steady state voltammograms were obtained. The voltage of electrolysis of pure water changed from 1. 3 V to 0. 5 V. The current was at most 100 times larger than theoretical values calculated from the concentration of hydrogen ion in pure water 10 - 7 M. The reason of establishing the steady state current can be explained by redox cycling 2 H+ + 2 e ↔ H 2. The redox cycling reaction accompanied with dissociation of water H 2 O ↔ H+ + OH- was a source of hydrogen ion. When hydrogen ion was added to salt solution, the voltammograms with point-symmetry with respect to I= 0 and E= 0 was obtained, the limiting current was approximately proportional to the concentration of [H+], when [H+] 0. 3 mM, the limiting current may be not controlled by diffusion of hydrogen ion, so it deviated from proportionality. Current-voltage curves of the redox cycling reaction at low hydrogen concentration was expressed by jlim= 2 Fc+D+/ω 	The experimental value was close to the theoretical one. Redox cycling should occur for O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 4 e- ↔ 4 OH-. There was no any limiting current after deliberately added oxygen gas in pure water. The disappearance of limiting current may be ascribed to a large overpotential difference between the cathodic and the anodic reaction of dioxygen...|$|E

Resistive switching properties are detected after application of higher voltages. Temperature evolution of magnetic phase composition of the sample is analyzed in detail, based on results of electron spin resonance measurements.

However, it is unknown if a field that causes cell migration is also capable of guiding cell differentiation— and the mechanisms for these processes remain unclear. Here, we report that a 115 V/m direct current (DC) electric field can induce directional migration of neural precursor cells (NPCs). Whole cell patching revealed that the cell membrane depolarized in the electric field, and buffering of extracellular calcium via EGTA prevented cell migration under these conditions. Immunocytochemical staining indicated that the same electric intensity {{could also be used}} to enhance differentiation and increase the percentage of cell differentiation into neurons, but not astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The results indicate that DC electric field of this specific intensity is capable of promoting cell directional migration and orchestrating functional differentiation, suggestively mediated by calcium influx during DC field exposure...|$|R

The rate of drift of the ions was found to be dependent upon the polarity of the electric field. The ions had greater mobility under a negative applied bias.

Here we report the first perovskite-PCBM hybrid solid with significantly reduced hysteresis and recombination loss achieved in a single step.

The PCBM passivates the key PbI 3 (-) antisite defects during the perovskite self-assembly, as revealed by theory and experiment. Photoluminescence transient spectroscopy proves that the PCBM phase promotes electron extraction.

40|$|The {{electron}} transfer properties of p-chloranil (2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachloro- 1, 4 - benzoquinone, TCBQ) were investigated in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. For the homogeneous study, the electrochemical reduction of TCBQ {{was carried out}} in different aprotic solvents (namely: benzonitrile (BN), N,N,dimethylformamide (DMF), propylcyanide (PrCN) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) and revealed two successive one-electron reductions according to a quasi-reversible EE mechanism. For the heterogeneous study, cyclic voltammetry with basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes modified with microdroplets of benzonitrile/TCBQ was employed. The droplets were found to be randomly dispersed with a degree of overlapping and average diameters of 5 μm giving the microdroplets individual volumes of ca. 33 fL. The redox processes within the electrically insulating microdroplets were shown to be very sensitive to the nature and concentration of ions in the surrounding aqueous phase as, in order to retain electroneutrality within the unsupported oil phase, <b>electric</b> field-induced <b>migration</b> of ions likely occurs during the Faradaic current flow. Depending on the lipophilicity of the aqueous electrolyte cation uptake into or electrochemical generated anion expulsion from the organic phase containing the electroactive specie TCBQ was induced electrochemically. Alkali metal cation uptake into the microdroplet environment was not observed. However less hydrophilic tetraalkylammonium cations NR 4 + (R+ = Bu and Pe) inserted. Proton insertion into the oil phase was also shown to occur as the current|voltage shifted to more positive potentials, making the reductive process more facile, as the pH of the buffer solution was decreased. The higher efficiency of proton insertion as compared with Group I cations insertion was explained in terms of the formation of strong O-H covalent bonds which outweighs the ion phase transfer thermodynamics. Finally, the cross-phase {{electron transfer}} across the benzonitrile|water interface was examined when the TCBQ microdroplets were purposely made conductive by addition of a hydrophobic, nonpartitioning electrolyte in the oil phase. Again, the resulted voltammetry was found to change depending on the identity and concentration of the salt dissolved in the surrounding aqueous environment...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{electric}} currents generated instantly at skin wounds direct {{migration of}} epithelial cells {{and are likely}} to be important in wound healing. Migration of fibroblasts is critical in wound healing. It remains unclear how wound <b>electric</b> fields guide <b>migration</b> of dermal fibroblasts. We report here that mouse skin wounds generated endogenous electric currents for many hours. Human dermal fibroblasts of both primary and cell-line cultures migrated directionally but slowly toward the anode in an electric field of 50 – 100 [*]mV[*]mm− 1. This is different from keratinocytes, which migrate quickly to the cathode. It took more than 1 [*]hour for dermal fibroblasts to manifest detectable directional migration. Larger field strength (400 [*]mV[*]mm− 1) was required to induce directional migration within 1 [*]hour after onset of the field. Phosphatidylinositol- 3 -OH kinase (PI 3 kinase) mediates cathode-directed migration of keratinocytes. We tested the role of PI 3 kinase in anode-directed migration of fibroblasts. An applied electric field activated PI 3 kinase/Akt in dermal fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts from p 110 γ (a PI 3 kinase catalytic subunit) null mice showed significantly decreased directional migration. These results suggest that physiological electric fields may regulate motility of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes differently, albeit using similar PI 3 kinase-dependent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{intrinsic}} low resistance characteristic of gallium oxide devices and the extraordinary sensitivity of their conductivity towards oxygen concentration much interest has recently arisen in their potential application for resistive {{random access memory}} (RRAM). In a previous study, Aoki et al. found resistive switching behavior in highly-nonstoichiometric, amorphous gallium oxide thin films. Modeling of the switching kinetics by <b>electric</b> field-driven oxygen <b>migration</b> and the resulting local changes in electron conductivity indicated a link between the observed properties and the disordered nature of the films. Whereas for most materials an electroforming process is needed to activate the resistive switching behavior, electroforming is not necessary in this case. As the proposed mechanism is linked to oxygen diffusion, in this work the oxygen transport was studied in amorphous gallium oxide thin films prepared by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). 18 O/ 16 O isotope exchange experiments were performed as a function of temperature, time and oxygen partial pressure. The 18 O penetration profiles were measured by depth profiling and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Electrical conductivity measured as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure by the van der Pauw method showed that amorphous structure and sub-stoichiometry is beneficial in terms of total conductivity...|$|R
40|$|Kindler {{syndrome}} (KS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} blistering skin disease resulting from pathogenic mutations in FERMT 1. This gene encodes kindlin- 1, a focal adhesion protein involved in {{activation of the}} integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Most cases of KS show a marked reduction or complete absence of the kindlin- 1 protein in keratinocytes, resulting in defective cell adhesion and <b>migration.</b> <b>Electric</b> fields also act as intrinsic regulators of adhesion and migration in the skin, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here we show that keratinocytes derived from KS patients are unable to undergo electrotaxis, and this defect is restored by overexpression of wild-type kindlin- 1 but not a W 612 A mutation that prevents kindlin-integrin binding. Moreover, deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin- 1 also failed to rescue electrotaxis in KS cells, indicating that both integrin and lipid binding are required for this function. Kindlin- 1 was also required {{for the maintenance of}} lamellipodial protrusions during electrotaxis via electric field-activated β 1 integrin. Indeed, inhibition of β 1 integrins also leads to loss of electrotaxis in keratinocytes. Our data suggest that loss of kindlin- 1 function may therefore result in epithelial insensitivity to electric fields and contribute to KS disease pathology...|$|R
50|$|In an {{electrodialysis}} stack, the dilute (D) feed stream, brine or concentrate (C) stream, and electrode (E) stream {{are allowed}} to flow through the appropriate cell compartments formed by the ion exchange membranes. Under the influence of an electrical potential difference, the negatively charged ions (e.g., chloride) in the dilute stream migrate toward the positively charged anode. These ions pass through the positively charged anion exchange membrane, but are prevented from further migration toward the anode by the negatively charged cation exchange membrane and therefore stay in the C stream, which becomes concentrated with the anions. The positively charged species (e.g., sodium) in the D stream migrate toward the negatively charged cathode and pass through the negatively charged cation exchange membrane. These cations also stay in the C stream, prevented from further migration toward the cathode by the positively charged anion exchange membrane. As {{a result of the}} anion and cation <b>migration,</b> <b>electric</b> current flows between the cathode and anode. Only an equal number of anion and cation charge equivalents are transferred from the D stream into the C stream and so the charge balance is maintained in each stream. The overall result of the electrodialysis process is an ion concentration increase in the concentrate stream with a depletion of ions in the dilute solution feed stream see video.|$|R
40|$|Currents that {{leak out}} of wounds {{generate}} electric fields lateral to the wound. These fields induce directional locomotion of human keratinocytes in vitro and may promote wound healing in vivo. We {{have examined the}} effects of growth factors and calcium, normally present in culture medium and the wound fluid, on the directional migration of human keratinocytes in culture. In electric fields of physiologic strength (100 mV per mm), keratinocytes migrated directionally towards the cathode {{at a rate of about}} 1 μm per min. This directional migration requires several growth factors. In the absence of these growth factors, the cell migration rate decreased but directionality was maintained. Epidermal growth factor alone restored cell migration rates at concentrations as low as 0. 2 ng per ml. Insulin at 5 – 100 μg per ml or bovine pituitary extract at 0. 2 %– 2 % vol/vol also stimulated keratinocyte motility but was not sufficient to fully restore the migration rate. Keratinocyte <b>migration</b> in <b>electric</b> fields requires extracellular calcium. Changes in calcium concentrations from 3 μM to 3. 3 mM did not significantly change keratinocyte migration rate nor directionality in electric fields; however, addition of the chelator ethyleneglycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid to migration medium reduced, and eventually abolished, keratinocyte motility. Our results show that (i) growth factors and extracellular calcium are required for <b>electric</b> field-induced directional <b>migration</b> of human keratinocytes, and (ii) keratinocytes migrate equally well in low and high calcium media...|$|R
40|$|Noroviruses are {{the leading}} cause of acute {{gastroenteritis}} and foodborne illnesses in the United States. Enhanced methods for detecting noroviruses in food matrices are needed as current methods are complex, labor intensive and insensitive, often resulting in inhibition of downstream molecular detection and inefficient recovery. Membrane-based electro-separation (MBES) is a technique to exchange charged particles through a size-specific dialysis membrane from one solution to another using electric current as the driving force. Norovirus has a net negative surface charge in a neutrally buffered environment, so when placed in an electric field, it moves towards the anode. It can then be separated from the cathodic compartment where the sample is placed and then collected in the anodic compartment for downstream detection. In this study, a MBES-based system was designed, developed and evaluated for concentrating and recovering murine norovirus (MNV- 1) from phosphate buffer. As high as 30. 8 % MNV- 1 migrated from the 3. 5 ml sample chamber to the 1. 5 ml collection chamber across a 1 μm separation membrane when 20 V was applied for 30 min using 20 mM sodium phosphate with 0. 01 % SDS (pH 7. 5) as the electrolyte. In optimization of the method, weak applied voltage (20 V), moderate duration (30 min), and low ionic strength electrolytes with SDS addition were needed to increase virus movement efficacy. The electric field strength of the system was the key factor to enhance virus movement, which could only be improved by shortening the electrodes distance, instead of increasing system applied voltage because of virus stability. This study successfully demonstrated the norovirus mobility in an <b>electric</b> field and <b>migration</b> across a size-specific membrane barrier in sodium phosphate electrolyte. With further modification and validation in food matrixes, a novel, quick, and cost-effective sample clean-up technique might be developed to separate norovirus particles from food matrices by electric force...|$|R

Methods: For the recipient test bed of the experiments in my thesis, I used retinal explants from mice. The viability of retinal explants was determined using retinal ganglion cell health as a read-out {{in the form of}} Sholl plots. I also explored magnetofection with oscillation as a non-viral technique for neuroprotection delivery in ocular tissue using cornea and retinal explants. Using the galvanotaxis technique, I explored its use in directing neural stem cells in-vitro with an electrotactic chamber and ex-vivo on a retinal explant in a modified Boyden chamber. Finally, I magnetofected neural stem cells to over-express BDNF and directed their migration into the retina using galvanotaxis. Results: The retinal explants had a viability of up to 3 days based on the Sholl plots of retinal ganglion cells. Magnetofection with oscillation transfected cornea endothelium and the retinal ganglion cell layer with GFP in the explant models. It also transfected neural stem cells with BDNF-myc. Directed migration with neural stem cells occurred in the electrotactic chamber {{as well as in the}} retinal explant model.

Conclusion: Within the period of up to 3 days, retinal explants can be used to investigate neuroprotective therapeutic agents using Sholl plots of retinal ganglion cells. Magnetofection with oscillation is a novel non-viral technique for potentially transfecting the eye in the anterior and posterior segments.

40|$|Electro-osmosis is an {{effective}} driving force which moves fluid through a fine-grained soil of low hydraulic conductivity. When electrodes are installed in a wet soil, fluid will be moved from the anode to the cathode by the applied <b>electric</b> field. Ionic <b>migration</b> will cause ions in the pore fluid of the soil to be migrated by the electric field in directions controlled by the charge of the ions, even if the fluid is stationary. Combining electro-osmosis with ionic migration results {{in the possibility of}} electro-kinetic removal of inorganic and organic contaminants from polluted soils. However, other electrochemical reactions, such as electrolysis, ion diffusion, development of pH and osmotic gradients, mineral decomposition, ion exchange, precipitation of salts and secondary minerals, hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, physical and chemical adsorption, and fabric change, etc., will occur simultaneously. Hence the physics and chemistry involved in the removal mechanisms are very complex and have yet to be understood before the technique can be fully utilized. This paper will present the theoretical and laboratory experimental research being performed at Texas A&M University to better understand these complex transport phenomena. The removal process will involve the coupled flows of fluid, electricity, and contaminants under simultaneously imposed hydraulic, electrical, and chemical gradients. The formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used for the formulation of the flow processes. The change in pH and the resulting change in chemical state of the contaminants are also included in the theoretical formulation. A new experimental apparatus has been designed, fabricated, and assembled. Experiments are performed on kaolinite consolidated from slurry to evaluate the validity of the theoretical formulation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A {{survey of}} the methods of {{purification}} of KC 1, for use in preparing single crystals by growth from the melt, was made. Two methods, fractional recrystallization and ion exchange, were used. The purity of the salt and crystals grown from the same salt were compared {{with the findings of}} other authors. The ion exchange method of purification produced a salt with < 0. 01 ppm lead ion and the material was suitable as a "pure" host matrix {{for the study of the}} properties of lead ion in KC 1 single crystals. Two crystal-growing apparatus were designed and built to produce pure and lead ion-containing KC 1 single crystals in an atmosphere of air or other gases. A novel method of producing a "dual" crystal, one section pure, the other containing lead ion, in a continuous host crystal, was introduced. The incorporation of lead ion into these crystals was studied by means of spectrophotometry and evidence for the incorporation of the ion at more than one site was noted. The homogeneity of doping was considered a function of the crystal growth method and the manner of incorporation of the lead ion into the crystal. A scanning absorption cell was designed and built to observe the uniformity of lead ion distribution in the crystal. The dithizone method of trace analysis of lead was adapted to the analysis of KC 1 single crystals containing lead. The oscillator strength of the 273 mμ band, called the A band, of lead ion in KC 1 was found to be 0. 11. A preliminary investigation of the thermal sensitivity of the A band and some other bands due to lead ion, observed in the 250 - 270 mμ region, was made. It was found that quenching from 600 °C maximized the A band. The diffusion and electrolytic transport of lead ion were studied to evaluate the effective charge on the lead ion species migrating under the influence of an <b>electric</b> field. <b>Migration</b> was studied from both plane and extended sources and the mobility of the species at 560 °C was found to be no greater than 8 x 10 ⁻⁹ cm²/volt sec. The effective charge on the species was determined to be no greater than 0. 6 of an electronic charge. This value is smaller than the charge on the free lead ion, and it is suggested that the lead ion migrates as a complex. The possible complexes involve the association of positive ion vacancies or chloride ions with the lead ion. The reduction of lead ion to elemental lead near the junction between the pure and lead-containing regions partially explained the apparent migration of lead ion, in a field, toward the anode as observed by other authors. The conductivity of pure and lead ion-containing crystals was observed. The association energy of a positive ion vacancy with the lead ion was found to be about 0. 1 eV or greater. An anomaly in the experimental conductivity curves is explained by the loss of lead ion from crystals...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{for the first time}} electro-guided, {{self-propelled}} droplets, which are composed solely of an ionic liquid (IL), namely trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride ([P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl]). These self-propelled droplets travel along an aqueous-air boundary and are guided to specific destinations within the fluidic network through the use of electro-chemically generated Cl- gradients. The direction of movement can be controlled by switching the impressed voltage (9 V, ON or OFF) and polarity of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte solution. Controlled release of surfactants has been investigated previously as a method of controlling surface tension in aqueous systems in order to achieve spontaneous movement of droplets at the air-liquid interface [1, 2]. When a surfactant is released into an aqueous solution, the surface tension is lowered. Liquid flows from areas of low surface tension to areas of high surface tension, a phenomenon known as the Marangoni effect. Using stimuli-responsive surfactants, smart droplets have been designed which can solve complex mazes [1] or can be attracted or repelled by light [2], in a contactless manner. Electro-tactic movement of the droplets is due to the controlled release of the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+, a very efficient cationic surfactant, which is a constituent of the IL droplet (Fig. 1). The asymmetric release of the cationic surfactant is controlled through modulation of the IL counter anion (Cl-) solubility, as this controls the rate of release of the cationic surfactant in order to maintain electroneutrality within the droplet. The solubility of the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ is limited in aqueous solutions and is dependent on the local ionic strength of the solution (Fig. 2). Therefore in ionic strength gradients there is a differential release of the surfactant from droplet boundary into the solution, which in turn results in an asymmetrical surface tension gradient around the droplet. This leads to Marangoni like flows, which propel the droplet from areas of low surface tension to areas of high surface tension. The chip used in this work was 3 D printed (Objet 350 Connex printer) as were the titanium mesh electrodes (Realizer SLM- 50) embedded in the chip. By applying an external electric field to the solution, a [P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl] droplet can be moved from the cathode (-) to the anode (+) (Fig. 3). The external <b>electric</b> field causes <b>migration</b> of ions, which results in concentration enrichment of ions in the proximity of the electrodes [3], Na+ at the cathode (starting position) and Cl- at the anode (destination). The resulting ion migration towards the electrodes creates an ionic strength gradient within the channel which controls the movement of the droplet. Additionally, the applied electric field causes Faradic arrangement of the charged ions within the IL droplet [3]. This also creates concentration gradients of the ions within the droplet, reinforcing the droplet movement mechanism. The electro-generation of gradients therefore provides a simple means to control the speed and direction of movement of droplets within fluidic channels in a very flexible manner. ...|$|R
