5|$|Brownsea Castle, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Branksea Castle, was originally a Device Fort constructed by Henry VIII between 1545 and 1547 to protect Poole Harbour in Dorset, England, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> French attack. Located on Brownsea Island, it comprised a stone blockhouse with a hexagonal gun platform. It was garrisoned {{by the local}} town with six soldiers and armed with eight artillery pieces. The castle remained in use after the original invasion scare had passed and was occupied by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 1640s. By {{the end of the}} century, however, it had fallen into disuse.|$|E
5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction wrought by Hurricane Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values. Research {{indicates that the}} typical hurricane strike raises real house prices {{for a number of}} years, with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence. However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> future hurricanes as well.|$|E
5|$|Marylebone was reprieved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> closure on 30 April 1986, and an £85million {{modernisation}} and refurbishment programme of {{the station}} and its services was granted. This was funded by selling part {{of the station}} to developers, including two of the original four platforms at {{the west of the}} station and the third span of the train shed. In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The run-down lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains, and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first long-distance service into Marylebone since 1966. Initially this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Some time later, Suzuha appears before Rintarō, having {{arrived in}} a time machine from the future. She tells Rintarō {{that the only way}} to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name. However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.|$|E
5|$|With that, the Yuan dynasty, {{established}} by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, {{became the first}} foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being {{the head of the}} Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, he did not mention a Great Wall.|$|E
