25|$|The curious {{personal}} {{character of}} La Fontaine, {{like that of}} some other men of letters, has been enshrined {{in a kind of}} legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told who he was, and remarking, Ah, yes, I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> somewhere!, of his insisting on fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings wrong side out, , with, for a contrast, those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness in company.|$|E
2500|$|I was to {{have dinner}} that night with [...] Cadogan. As I lay in my bath, I {{reflected}} that the last time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{had been in his}} room at the Foreign Office when I had handed him my letter of resignation from the Diplomatic Service. [...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{the giant}} answered, 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> pass, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> come back. The spell must have worked upon him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>Him</b> in the watch-fires of {{a hundred}} {{circling}} camps, ...|$|R
50|$|DICK aside. No {{question}} of that; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> whipp'd three market-days together.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, more sweetly and pleasantly than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> smile yet.|$|E
60|$|Well, I couldn't {{contradict}} her, {{not after}} the way <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{looking at her}} across the table.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not mention}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> take them from his hat and slip them into his coat-tail pocket.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you know}} that George is barrister-at-law of the Inner Temple--is? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> gazetted.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{difficult}} to explain,' said Ethelberta evasively. 'I knew one many years ago, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> again, and--that is all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Pereo, reflectively, warming {{under the}} potent fires of flattery and aguardiente, [...] "possibly <b>I</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> He was like--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke with}} his {{customary}} spirit; {{he moved with}} his customary briskness--he had become quite himself again, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> last.|$|E
60|$|I said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> and waited, {{anticipating the}} next question. Romayne {{fulfilled}} my expectations. He inquired if Winterfield had left London.|$|E
60|$|Our host looked familiar, {{but as he}} {{was painted}} and wore a bonnet of eagle {{feathers}} I could not remember where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|October 1846.--Wordsworth dined with us one {{day last}} week, and was in much greater vigour than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> all this summer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mabel, {{he loves}} you as I loved your mother. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> weep like a child when {{speaking}} of his feelings towards you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, brawlie did I ken Steenie, puir fallow," [...] {{replied the}} prisoner;--"but I canna condeshend on ony {{particular}} time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> lately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I measure other men's wrath by mine, mejuffrouw--and if a rogue {{had stolen}} my daughter, I should not rest until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> hanged." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{concluded}} the man must be employed by Mr. Woodward. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{at some time}} in Darbyville, and so thought his face familiar.|$|E
60|$|The {{fellow was}} overdoing it a little, I thought; then, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> safely {{locked up for}} the night, I {{walked back to the}} kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, faith, I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>him!</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{too often}} a'ready. I'll <b>see</b> <b>him</b> another time, perhaps, if 'tis to oblige 'ee." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cel. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> somewhere, {{but where}} I know not:--Pry'thee, my friend, leave us; dost thou think, {{we do not}} know our way in court? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andy Royce? Yes, he {{is working}} there. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> several times. He is quite a changed man, and I don't think he drinks at all." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> risk {{his limbs}} blindly at a fox-hunt {{and in a}} cricket-field; and soon {{afterwards}} I saw him risk his life, just as blindly, in the sea at Brighton.|$|E
60|$|I {{bowed and}} walked to the door. He called me back and gave me the letter which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> place on the table by itself at the {{beginning}} of our interview.|$|E
6000|$|Yes! There was Bruno, {{standing}} with the tears running down his cheeks, just as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{a quarter of an}} hour ago; and there was Sylvie with her arms round his neck! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "De St. Ethol {{is one of}} {{the first}} nobles in France. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> at the races many times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> do {{it several}} times this evening. <b>I</b> believe he <b>has</b> done it more, but I am {{prepared}} to swear to seven times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ever so much better, mother. I suppose I shall {{hardly know}} Agnes, but Harry cannot have altered much; besides, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{four years later}} than her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, citizen," [...] he said, [...] "Caudy thought then that the Englishman was inside the house, whilst I was equally sure that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> go downstairs an hour before." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{came into}} the club and shook hands with me as if he hadn't seen me for a year. In reality <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> only eleven months ago, and hadn't thought of him since.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{about ten}} minutes after, we saw the Wild Man riding slowly forward. He was a strange sight. It {{was the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> {{although}} I had often heard of him before.|$|E
6000|$|... “Can {{you make}} out that man?” he said. “This {{is the third}} time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> It is {{noticeable}} that he shows himself just under the lamp.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{made up my}} mind last night," [...] the squire said, [...] "to do {{something}} for <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before, and was much struck with him." ...|$|R
5000|$|He's {{someone who}} is very {{intelligent}} ... {{but you never know}} which mood {{he is going to be}} in. Some days he will treat you like his long-lost brother. The next day he ignores you completely.The players have a word for him. They say he lives on [...] "Planet Ivanchuk". (Laughs) ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> totally drunk and singing Ukrainian poetry and then the next day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> give an impressive talk.His playing style is unpredictable and highly original, making him more dangerous but sometimes leading to quick losses as well.|$|R
