500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but I always said that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{think it}} has,' Lawford {{answered}} calmly. 'But I don't quite see what suicide <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it; unless--You know Widderstone, then, Sheila?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, {{one thing}} is certain--something <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> It is no use crying over spilt milk, that I can see. It is a horribly bad business, but grieving over it won't make it any better. What one <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> decide on some plan or other, and then set to work to carry it out." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lee also criticised the government's {{policies}} {{by stating}} that [...] "hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens {{to go up to}} the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced.

Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." [...] He also lamented [...] "Malaysia—to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{a series}} of {{controversial}} military campaigns were launched, known as the War on Terror. In November 2001, shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan, the MTV Europe Music Awards were held in Frankfurt, where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance. As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. In his speech, he said [...] "So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [...] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing {{one of the poorest}} countries in the world is wrong. You've got a voice and you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what you can about it alright?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The crisis {{continued}} to worsen. [...] By {{the third week}} of October, the number of Ebola patients had increased to almost 60, overwhelming the volunteers in the isolation ward. [...] Lukwiya ordered other nurses to assist the patients and tried to lead by example, working with Ebola patients from 7 am to 8 pm. [...] However, despite instituting risk minimisation procedures, including wearing of robes, multiple gloves, surgical masks and goggles, hospital workers {{continued to}} fall ill. [...] Twelve more died. [...] At the funeral of an Italian nun on 7 November, he attempted to rally the morale of his workers: [...] "It is our vocation to save life. [...] It involves risk, but when we serve with love, that is when the risk does not matter so much. When we believe our mission is to save lives, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it's a good one," [...] {{returned}} Tom, with {{an assumed}} grin. [...] "A fellow who comes into a fat legacy <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something, hasn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot {{see what}} the {{proximity}} of the coast <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see what}} all that <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that {{wandering}} tramp," [...] said the colonel, who {{was by no}} means pleased with this history of his property.|$|R
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Then {{you have}} done all you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Say another word--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{evidence}} {{enough for}} us to go for Craig, though! What we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to get a confession out of him, somehow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is what he}} means," [...] Juan said, {{with great}} satisfaction. [...] "What he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> touch things, and for us {{to tell him the}} names." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind; {{as long as}} we can't pay a porter {{some one}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it among us. I'll get my book," [...] added the shipping-clerk, glancing at Richard.|$|R
6000|$|... "To God," [...] {{said the}} boy reverently. [...] "It's like the talent in the parable. One <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for God with it, and then it won't turn to harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come with me, my boy, {{into the}} larder. There, help yourself; {{you must be}} hungry and tired, and you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, one of {{your hands}} can finish that," [...] the {{boatswain}} said. [...] "Anyhow, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this suit, or you will hear of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Desmond {{asked him}} no questions, but {{turned to the}} seamen. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, boys," [...] he said. [...] "Shift that after roller under her nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes!" [...] resumed Sir Patrick, impatiently. [...] "Blanche's {{distress}} is intelligible enough. But here is {{my niece}} apparently answerable for this unhappy woman's disappearance. Can you explain what my niece <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather, {{although}} I {{suppose he}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something for a}} living,--and I guess he isn't the fellow to pick out hard work. Acting in the movies must be easy--and lots of fun in the bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{not so much}} {{saying it}} that I object to,' {{returned}} Mr Venus, 'as <b>doing</b> it. And <b>having</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it whether or no, I can't afford to waste my time on groping for nothing in cinders.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} with his daughter, {{and when they were}} in the patio the girl looked at him. “You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for them,” she said quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... “I really don’t {{see what}} my boys <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the {{criminal}} classes,” said Mrs. Eggelby resentfully. “They have been most carefully brought up, I can assure you that.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess we}} are all too lame to go ashore among those snakes," [...] said Giant, with a short laugh. [...] "But we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something," [...] he added, seriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{see what}} he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the matter at all; for, I don't suppose that King Louis is such a fool as to expect to be king of England as well as king of France!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Didn’t I?” faltered Lola; “I thought I {{told you}} it was a brown horse. It was {{certainly}} brown in both dreams. But I don’t see what the colour <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Nursery Tea and Le Five O’Clock are both chestnuts.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Joan," [...] she said, [...] "you know it's simply ridiculous. You {{could never}} pass as a lady's maid. The other {{servants}} would find you out. I expect {{there are all}} sorts of things a lady's maid <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and not do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here," [...] {{he said to}} Sladen, [...] "you can't {{use this}} hotel for an {{employment}} office. If you want to hire help, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it on the outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However! Enough of that! You spoke some brave {{words to}} me just now, Captain Jorgan, and they shall not be spoken in vain. I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something. What I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> before all other things, is to trace out {{the meaning of this}} paper, {{for the sake of the}} Good Name that has no one else to put it right. And still for the sake of the Good Name, and my father's memory, not a word of this writing must be breathed to my mother, or to Kitty, or to any human creature. You agree in this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Grant {{laughed a}} little. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess he's sensible. Now, what you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{is to bring}} out the two homesteaders as quick as you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All of a sudden," [...] ses Sam, [...] "they {{see they}} <b>'ad</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with a man}} wot didn't know wot fear was, and they turned round and ran off {{as hard as they}} could run. You ought to ha' been there, Ginger. You'd 'ave enjoyed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have a Grand Marnier," [...] he said. [...] "I don't {{know how}} bad it is. Everything is bad now. They lay {{it down to the}} war as well. It used to be quite a decent drink. What the war <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with bad liqueurs, I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I love to {{have these}} little chats with you about your female relatives, Jeeves," [...] I said coldly, for I felt {{that the man had}} let me down, and I was fed up with him. [...] "But I don't see what all this <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my trouble." ...|$|R
