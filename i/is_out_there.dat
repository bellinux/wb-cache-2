We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that.

500|$|Systemic {{consequences}} were felt, as Enron's creditors {{and other}} energy trading companies suffered {{the loss of}} several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could. The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, [...] "We don't really know who <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling my clients {{to prepare for the}} worst." ...|$|E

The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E
500|$|The Bookseller {{called the}} book [...] "the first {{comprehensive}} encyclopedia of its kind". In {{a review of}} the encyclopedia for The Guardian, Andrew Mueller called it a [...] "beautifully-produced tome" [...] and commented that the work [...] "succeeds, as was probably intentional, in offering some fascinating tours of the byways of history and providing a tantalising alternative universe in which much of what you know may not be what it seems". John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film.

500|$|Following the {{box office}} success of J. J.

Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there...</b> even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Deep Throat {{has been well}} received by critics and fans. Entertainment Weekly described Hardin's performance as [...] "world-weary and heavyhearted", and listed his appearance in the character's eponymous début episode as the 37th greatest television moment of the 1990s. However, they felt at times that his presence in episodes such as [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] seemed [...] "gratuitous". Reviewing the character's début episode, the San Jose Mercury News called Deep Throat [...] "the most interesting new character on television". Chris Carter has stated that Hardin's performance gave the series an element of [...] "believability" [...] that it needed; and felt that the episode [...] "E.B.E." [...] was {{a great opportunity to}} expand the character's role. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called Deep Throat's death [...] "a shocking moment, even when you know it's coming", praising the [...] "desperation" [...] evident in Hardin's performance, although lamenting the [...] "curse of continuity" [...] that led to the character being quickly replaced with Steven Williams' X. Ben Rawson-Jones, writing for Digital Spy, felt that Deep Throat's tenure on The X-Files was [...] "arguably the show's peak", and praised Hardin's acting in the role. Brian Lowry, in his book The Truth <b>Is</b> <b>Out</b> <b>There,</b> has noted that the character [...] "helped establish a tone and undercurrent of gravity on The X-Files that was to provide the spine of the series".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came {{over to my house}} to start working, she asked me to play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E
