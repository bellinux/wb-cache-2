40|$|Development of the rodent {{somatosensory}} cortex is well characterised and involves activity-dependent mechanisms that occur {{during the first}} postnatal week. Glutamate is a key neurotransmitter responsible for signalling events that result in formation of cortical barrels - aggregates of cells in the cortex corresponding to whiskers on the <b>face</b> <b>pad.</b> The molecular mechanisms that occur downstream of glutamate signalling are not fully understood and data here contributes to the unveiling {{of some of these}} mechanisms. Transgenic mice with deletions of genes that encode members of the post-synaptic complex associated with NMDARs were used to understand the role of individual genes in the formation of barrels. SynGAP, a ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the ERK-MAPK pathway downstream of NMDARs is required for the formation of barrels and data here agrees with other findings that the ras GAP NF 1 has a similar role. Examination of RICS, a RhoGAP and Dusp 6 - a phosphatase that inactivates ERK reveals that neither are necessary for the formation of barrels. This finding adds to previous data postulating that barrels form in an ERK-independent manner (Watson et al., 2006, Barnett et al., 2006). MAGUKs are important scaffolding molecules in the PSD and bind NMDARs to downstream signalling molecules such as SynGAP. Two of these MAGUKs SAP 102 and PSD- 95 have roles in hippocampal plasticity, and learning and memory and Sap 102 mutations result in a form of X-linked human retardation (Tarpey et al., 2004). Deletion of either gene does not cause defects in the development of barrels, perhaps due to compensation mechanisms already described in hippocampus (Vickers et al., 2006 Cuthbert et al., 2007). Double knockout mice die by P 3 and analysis of all other mutants revealed a defect in the formation of barrels and segregation of TCAs in Sap 102 -/y Psd- 95 +/-. Surprisingly this defect was not seen in Sap 102 +/- Psd- 95 -/- mice, agreeing with previous findings that SAP 102 is better able to compensate for loss of PSD- 95 (is up-regulated) than PSD- 95 is for SAP 102. An explanation for this effect may lie with the fact that Sap 102 is X-linked and therefore females that are heterozygote for Sap 102 are mosaic with a population of cells expressing SAP 102 and a population not expressing SAP 102. Using β-Galactosidase antibody to label one population of cells, female mice that had two populations of cells were examined. In these mice one population of cells were Sap 102 -Psd- 95 +/-, and did not previously segregate into normal barrels and the other population were Sap 102 +Psd- 95 +/- and should segregate normally. Both populations of cells segregated normally, indicating that the cells expressing SAP 102 were rescuing the cells not expressing SAP 102 by a cell non-autonomous mechanism. The final part of this thesis focuses on the role of glutamate-dependent signalling pathways in the regulation of CSPGs- key extracellular matrix proteoglycans that regulate the termination of the sensitive period. Analysis of 3 overlapping but distinct subsets of chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) reveals that expression of each of the three is different throughout development. After 2 - 3 weeks perineuronal nets (PNNs) labelled with Cat- 315 and Cat- 316 are visible and locate to specific regions within the cortical barrel-field. To determine whether the formation of PNNs is regulated by proteins involved in glutamate signalling, expression of the three CSPG subsets was analysed in mice with barrel defects due to mutations of Plcβ 1, Mglur 5, Syngap and Prkar 2 b. Interestingly, Prkar 2 b mutant adults but no other mutants have reduced Cat- 315 -PNNs, indicating that PKARIIβ regulates pathways that lead to formation of Cat- 315 -PNNs in adulthood. Cat- 315 has previously been found to be regulated in the cortex of visually deprived cats and the cortex of whisker-trimmed mice, indicating that specific subsets of CSPGs are regulated by neuronal activity. Molecular pathways that lead to expression of Cat- 315 positive PNNs involve PKARIIβ and the formation of PNNs may be an important step in the plasticity of circuits in barrels. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an important part of molecular signalling downstream of glutamate enabling barrels to form is played by molecules that maintain structure inside the synapse and outside the cell.

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Background: Symptom relief in {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) {{can be obtained by}} invasive options such as endovascular stenting as well as exercise, and PAD medications. Each of these options have their own risks and benefits. A lack of knowledge about treatment options, risks and benefits, and how these matter to the patient, as well as a lack of support relating to treatment decisions can result in decisional conflict. We aimed to (1) document decisional conflict in patients <b>facing</b> <b>PAD</b> treatment decisions; (2) examine site variability in decisional conflict; and (3) examine whether decisional conflict is associated with PAD treatment strategy and 1 -year health status outcomes. Methods: The PORTRAIT study is an observational prospective study that enrolled patients with new or an exacerbation of PAD symptoms from 16 PAD specialty clinics in the US, the Netherlands, and Australia. Patients were interviewed before they underwent PAD treatments to document their socio-economic background and their health status (Peripheral Artery Questionnaire – PAQ). Medical history was abstracted from the medical records. At 3 months, treatment information and decisional conflict (yes/no – 4 -item SURE instrument) information was collected from the patient. One-year follow-up health status information was collected by phone interview. Median odds ratios were calculated to quantify the level of site variability. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to examine the association between decisional conflict and primary PAD treatment strategy (invasive vs. non-invasive). A multivariable linear regression model was built to examine the association between decisional conflict and 1 -year PAQ summary scores, while adjusting for baseline PAQ summary scores. Results: The unadjusted median odds ratio (MOR) for site variability was 2. 01 (95 % CI 1. 56 - 3. 13; p< 0. 001), after adjusting for country, the MOR was 1. 12 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 46; p= 0. 35). After adjustment for site and relevant patient covariates, decisional conflict was associated with lower odds of receiving invasive treatment (OR= 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 34 - 1. 00; p= 0. 050). Decisional conflict was also associated with lower 1 -year health status gains for the PAQ summary score (adjusted B=- 4. 72; 95 % CI - 9. 38;- 0. 06; p= 0. 047), even adjusting for primary PAD treatment strategy. Conclusion: One in five patients <b>facing</b> <b>PAD</b> treatment decisions experience decisional conflict. While there is considerable variation for the occurrence of decisional conflict, it is more common among non-US countries. As compared with patients who do not experience decisional conflict, those reporting conflict are more often managed non-invasively and experience lesser 1 -year health status gains, not entirely explained by the primary PAD treatment modality. Increasing knowledge and support for non-invasive PAD treatment options may be ways to reduce decisional conflict in PAD. Introduction [...] Methods [...] Results [...] Discussio...|$|R

5000|$|Goaltenders wear special leg pads {{to protect}} their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved {{significantly}} over the years. The earliest leg pads were {{very similar to the}} cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a skip-over roll, was added to the outside edge of each <b>pad</b> <b>face,</b> extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to {{the very top of the}} leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goalie pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the [...] "box" [...] style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the [...] "box" [...] style pad, the edge between the <b>pad</b> <b>face</b> and the <b>pad</b> inside edge is square, keeping the <b>pad</b> <b>face</b> more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the [...] "butterfly" [...] position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than 11 in and can be no longer than 38 in. The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.|$|R

The Pianet was a variant of the earlier reed-based Hohner electric piano the Cembalet which, like the Pianet, was intended for home use. Hohner offered both keyboards in their range until the early 1970s. The Pianet production consisted of two distinctly different mechanism groups with characteristically different sound.

5000|$|A {{spotface}} or {{spot face}} is a machined feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough [...] "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat. Other common applications of spotfacing involve <b>facing</b> a <b>pad</b> onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, {{without the need for}} finishing all over (FAO).|$|R

The more efficient users of this style include Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers, Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings, and Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Carbon fibre reinforced ceramic composites (Cf/C-SiC) have been explored as lightweight and durable disc in a friction brake. This composite was manufactured through infiltration of liquid silicon into a Cf/C perform. It has heterogeneous microstructure, composed of three key phases, silicon carbide, Cf/C, and un-reacted residual silicon. The development of the transfer layer on the friction surface of Cf/C-SiC was studied through microstructural image registration of the surface after a range of braking stops on a laboratory-scale dynamometer test rig. When an organic pad {{was used as the}} counter <b>face</b> brake <b>pad,</b> it was found that a steady transfer layer was developed in silicon regions right after initial stops; in carbon-fibre/carbon (Cf/C) regions and most of the silicon carbide region, the friction surfaces were unsteady and any possible friction transfer layers were hardly built up. Large voids and cracks/crevices likely became pools to quickly and efficiently collect the transferred materials generated by the friction, but the compacts formed inside the pools were susceptible to be stripped off by further braking operation. Three types of friction surfaces were generalized: type I, the friction transfer layer had a steady relationship with the matrix and respectable longevity; type II, the transfer layer had an unstable relationship with the matrix and poor durability; type III, the friction transfer layer had a steady relationship with the matrix but short lifetime. After testing against organic pads under the laboratory scale dynamometer testing condition, the friction surface of each key phase in Cf/C-SiC composites disc was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the transfer layer developed on Si consists of fine particles of metal silicides, silicates and minerals. The substrate damage of Si was not observed, while the precipitates having high oxygen content were found in the substrate. Formation of an interfacial bonding between transfer layer and silicon substrate {{is believed to be the}} key factor for the formation of a stable transfer layer on Si. However, the interfacial bonding between transferred materials and SiC was not detected. Kinks are common features developed on the friction surface of SiC. The interface between carbon fibre and carbon matrix was experienced mechanical damage, in form of microcracks, and the transferred material was developed in the interface. Instead of transfer layer, a thin amorphous film, produced by friction induced amorphisation of carbon fibre, was developed on top of carbon fibre...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{replacement}} of the babbit <b>facing</b> in thrust <b>pad</b> bearings with a composite polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface layer. The PTFE-faced bearings have been shown to allow a greater specific pressure, reduce thermal crowning, and, in some cases, negate the need for an oil-lift (jacking) system. These designs of bearing require new methods for the measurement of oil film thickness both to assist in their development and for plant condition monitoring. In this work, an ultrasonic method of oil film measurement is evaluated for this purpose. An ultrasonic transducer is mounted on the back face of the thrust pad. Pulses are generated and transmitted through the pad material, bonding interlayer, and PTFE surface layer. The proportion of the wave that reflects back from the oil film layer is determined. This is then related to the oil film thickness using a series of calibration experiments and a spring stiffness model. In practice, the reflected signal is difficult to distinguish, in the time domain, from other internal reflections from the pad. Signals are compared with reflections when no oil film is present and processing is carried out in the frequency domain. Experiments have been performed on a full size PTFE-faced thrust pad destined for a hydroelectric power station turbine. The instrumented pad was installed in a test facility and subjected to a range of loading conditions both with and without oil lift. Although there were some problems with the robustness of the experimental procedure, oil films were successfully measured and used to study the effect of the oil-lift system on film formation.

Tapping the screen creates a star that the Kirbys can follow or cling onto. By tapping enemies or obstacles on the screen, players can send multiple Kirbys to attack them, with the player also able to flick individual Kirbys as projectiles. By collecting pieces of fruit throughout the level, the player can gain up to ten controllable Kirbys, which allow players to tackle enemies and obstacles more easily than with one Kirby. Each level often requires a minimum number of Kirbys to enter, and some puzzles will require all ten Kirbys to solve. If a Kirby is hit by an enemy or obstacle, it will turn blue {{until the end of the}} level, or until the player finds a special gate which restores their health. If a blue Kirby is hit, it will turn grey and float away unless the player can drag him down and turn him blue again, with the game ending if the player runs out of Kirbys or fails a certain level objective. Hidden throughout each game are several medals, found either by exploring, solving puzzles or finding keys and treasure chests, which in turn unlock additional minigames and bonus features. Some levels also feature large lollipops that temporarily make all the Kirbys bigger, allowing them to break through barriers and reach new areas.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} for preparing inexpensive paper-based three-electrode electrochemical cells is here described. They consist of small circular pads of hydrophilic paper defined by hydrophobic barriers printed on paper with wax-based ink. The back <b>face</b> of these <b>pads</b> is insulated by thermally laminating a polyethylene layer and working, reference and counter electrodes are drawn on paper by using commercial pencil leads. At last, a controlled volume of sample containing a supporting electrolyte was laid {{to soak in}} paper channels. Their performance was evaluated by assaying these devices as both simple cells suitable for recording voltammograms on static samples and low-cost detectors for flowing systems. Voltammetric tests, conducted by using potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) as model prototype, were also exploited for identifying the brand and softness of graphite sticks enabling paper to be marked with lines displaying the best conductivity. By {{taking advantage of the}} satisfactory information thus gained, pencil drawn electrodes were tested as amperometric detectors for the separation of ascorbic acid and sunset yellow, which were chosen as prototype electroactive analytes because they are frequently present concomitantly in several food matrices, such as soft drinks and fruit juices. This separation was performed by planar thin layer chromatography conducted on microfluidic paper-based devices prepared by patterning on filter paper two longitudinal hydrophobic barriers, once again printed with wax-based ink. Factors affecting both separation and electrochemical detection were examined and optimised, with best performance achieved by using a 20 mM acetate running buffer (pH 4. 5) and by applying a detection potential of 0. 9 V. Under these optimum conditions, the target analytes could be separated and detected within 6 min. The recorded peaks were well separated and characterized by good repeatability and fairly good sensitivity, thus proving that this approach is indeed suitable for rapidly assembling inexpensive and reliable electrochemical detectors for flow analysis systems...|$|R
40|$|Planarization {{processes}} {{are a key}} enabling technology for continued performance and density improvements in integrated circuits (ICs). Dielectric material planarization is widely used in front-end-of-line (FEOL) processing for device isolation and in back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing for interconnection. This thesis studies the physical mechanisms and variations in the planarization using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). The major achievement and contribution of this work is a systematic methodology to physically model and characterize the non-uniformities in the CMP process. To characterize polishing mechanisms at different length scales, physical CMP models are developed in three levels: wafer-level, die-level and particle-level. The wafer-level model investigates the CMP tool effects on wafer-level pressure non-uniformity. The die-level model is developed to study chip-scale non-uniformity induced by layout pattern density dependence and CMP pad properties. The particle-level model focuses on the contact mechanism between pad asperities and the wafer. Two model integration approaches are proposed to connect wafer-level and particle-level models to the die-level model, so that CMP system impacts on die-level uniformity and feature size dependence are considered. The models are applied to characterize and simulate CMP processes by fitting polishing experiment data and extracting physical model parameters. A series of physical measurement approaches are developed to characterize CMP pad properties and verify physical model assumptions. Pad asperity modulus and characteristic asperity height are measured by nanoindentation and microprofilometry, respectively. Pad aging effect is investigated by comparing physical measurement results at different pad usage stages. Results show that in-situ conditioning keeps pad surface properties consistent to perform polishing up to 16 hours, even in the <b>face</b> of substantial <b>pad</b> wear during extended polishing. The CMP mechanisms identified from modeling and physical characterization are applied to explore an alternative polishing process, referred to as pad-in-a-bottle (PIB). A critical challenge related to applied pressure using pad-in-a-bottle polishing is predicted. by Wei Fan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|AbstractPurposePatients with lower-extremity {{peripheral}} arterial disease (<b>PAD)</b> <b>face</b> a {{high risk}} of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Platelet inhibition (PI) significantly reduces this risk. Combination PI is common and increasingly indicated in patients with PAD; however, the effect on platelet function has not been objectively evaluated. Aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Clop), and cilostazol (Cilo) are the three most commonly used PI drugs in patients with PAD. A prospective, sequential evaluation of platelet function using the template bleeding time (BT) was performed for PAD patients taking these medications singly and in combination. MethodsTwenty-one patients with PAD, averaging 65. 9 years of age, were studied. Patients were placed on sequential two-week regimens of the following therapies: washout (no PI), ASA (325 mg daily), ASA + Cilo (100 mg twice daily), washout, Cilo, Cilo + Clop (75 mg each day), washout, Clop, Clop + ASA, and Clop + ASA + Cilo. At the end of each phase, trained personnel measured the BT. ResultsBaseline bleeding time for the group was 4. 29 ± 1. 69 minutes. ASA (BT = 6. 64 ± 3. 52) and Clop (BT = 10. 17 ± 5. 4) significantly prolonged bleeding time (P < 0. 01); however, no significant effect was observed with Cilo alone (BT = 5. 41 ± 2. 69). Combined treatment with ASA + Clop (BT = 17. 39 ± 4. 59) had a more pronounced effect on BT compared with either agent alone (P < 0. 01). The addition of Cilo to either ASA (BT = 8. 3 ± 4. 27) or Clop (BT = 12. 7 ± 7. 46) or the combination of ASA + Clop (BT = 17. 92 ± 4. 69) did not prolong BT. ConclusionAll patients with PAD require platelet inhibition, and many require pharmacotherapy for intermittent claudication. The platelet inhibitors aspirin and clopidogrel are used for the reduction of ischemic events. They significantly prolong bleeding time individually and to a greater extent in combination. Cilo is used to improve walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. When Cilo is added to ASA, Clop, or the combination of the two, there is no additional increase in bleeding time. Therefore, Cilo can be used in combination with other platelet inhibitors without an additional effect on platelet function as reflected by the bleeding time...|$|R
