When her husband told her that the choice was hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E

5000|$|Plato’s <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good {{is often}} criticized as too general. [...] Plato’s <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good does not define {{things in the}} {{physical}} world that are good, and therefore lacks connectedness to reality. [...] Because Plato’s <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good lacks instruction, or ways for the individual to be good, Plato’s <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good is not applicable to human ethics since there is no defined method for which goodness can be pursued. Through Socrates in The Republic, Plato acknowledges <b>the</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good as an elusive concept and proposes that <b>the</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good be accepted as a hypothesis, rather than criticized for its weaknesses. According to Socrates in The Republic, the only alternative to accepting a hypothesis is to refute all the objections against it, which is counterproductive in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> contemplation.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Plato, Aristotle discusses <b>the</b> <b>Forms</b> <b>of</b> Good in critical terms {{several times in}} both of his major surviving ethical works, the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics.

Because Plato’s <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans {{have no reason to believe}} that <b>the</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good exists and <b>the</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.|$|R
