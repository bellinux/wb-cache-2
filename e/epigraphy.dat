5|$|The journal had {{an archaeological}} and {{historical}} focus, {{and in the}} late nineteenth century that naturally meant that <b>epigraphy</b> (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the Antiquary was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian <b>epigraphy</b> until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of <b>epigraphy,</b> the Epigraphia Indica, was published as a quarterly supplement to the Antiquary between 1892 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|A {{more careful}} project was {{undertaken}} between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made {{to place the}} stucco fragments. There is evidence of multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and <b>epigraphy.</b> Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the <b>epigraphy</b> of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E

5000|$|Most <b>epigraphies</b> / {{inscriptions}} mention {{just the}} title of the Bana Chieftain as [...] "Mahabali Banaraja". The Banas were identified by their geographical location as Pulinadu Banas, Tuynadu Banas, etc. Their genealogy was puranic and was narrated on copper-plates or temple grants. One example is the Udayendiram grant of Bana Vikramaditya III which narrates the puranic connection of Mahabali with Vishnu.|$|R
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design that allowed him to perceive this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and <b>epigraphy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} non-historical Byzantine sources is vast: {{they range from}} papyri to sermons (most notable those of Sophronius and Anastasius Sinaita), poetry (especially that of Sophronius and George of Pisidia) {{including}} the Acritic songs, correspondence often of a patristic provenance, apologetical treatises, apocalypses, hagiography, military manuals (in particular the Strategikon of Maurice {{from the beginning of}} the 7th century), and other non-literary sources, such as <b>epigraphy,</b> archeology, and numismatics. None of these sources contains a coherent account of any of the campaigns and conquests of the Muslim armies, but some do contain invaluable details that survive nowhere else.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epigraphy</b> {{provides}} {{an account of}} various aspects of Sangam polity and {{has been used to}} verify some of the information provided by sources such as literature and numismatics. The names of various kings and chieftains occurring in the inscriptions include Nedunj Cheliyan, Peruvaluthi, Cheras of the Irumporai family, Tittan, Nedunkilli, Adiyaman, Pittan and Korrantai. References to administration includes the chiefs, superintendents, titles of ministers, palace of merchants and the village assembly. Religious references to Buddhist and Jain monks are found frequently, which have provided valuable information explaining the spread of those religions in Tamilakam. Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations, the social stratification, flora, fauna, music and dance, names of cities and names of individuals are also found in the inscriptions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the garden}} {{to the west of}} the museum, large-sized stone {{artifacts}} are on display from the periods of Hittites, Hellenistic, Byzantine, Ilkhanate, Seljuk and Ottoman. These are Hittite gate lion statues, Hellenistic and Roman <b>epigraphies,</b> Ionic order and Corinthian order capitals, Roman sarcophagi made of marble and limestone, inscriptions and milestones, Byzantine steles and architectural elements as well as inscriptions of buildings, headstones, terracotta jars and mosque column capitals from the Ilkhanate, Seljuk and Ottoman periods.|$|R
50|$|The hill Kalugumalai ("Hill of the vulture"). Earlier it {{was known}} as Araimalai or Thirumalai. Even before that it was {{referred}} as Nechchuram and Tiruneccuram. Some of the <b>epigraphies</b> mentions {{that there was a}} palace for the pandya official called Ettimannan. At the foot of the Kalugumalai a large urn-burial cemetery was found. However hundreds of urns were destroyed during limestone quarrying. Opposite to Kalugasalamoorthy Temple there is a small palace which served as local residence of Raja of Ettaiyapuram.|$|R
50|$|Mavali Vanadarayan was {{the title}} of chiefs of the Bana country in the basin of the Palar river, the extent of whose {{territory}} changed according to the vicissitudes of history. Territorial changes are deducible from <b>epigraphies.</b> However, the personal names of many Bana Chieftains are not known, {{especially with regard to}} the wars they waged against their opponents. One such example is the Thiruvallam record of Vijaya Nandivikrama Varman (792-793 AD) which states that a certain Mavali-Vanaraya was ruling Vadugavali-12000. However, the personal name of this Mahavali-Banaraja is not known.|$|R
5|$|The major {{political}} and cultural center of Mesoamerica in the Early Classic period was Teotihuacan. The identity of the language(s) spoken by Teotihuacan's founders has long been debated, with the relationship of Nahuatl to Teotihuacan being prominent in that enquiry. While in the 19th and early 20th centuries it was presumed that Teotihuacan had been founded by speakers of Nahuatl, later linguistic and archaeological research tended to disconfirm this view. Instead, {{the timing of the}} Nahuatl influx was seen to coincide more closely with Teotihuacan's fall than its rise, and other candidates such as Totonacan identified as more likely. But recently, evidence from Mayan <b>epigraphy</b> of possible Nahuatl loanwords in Mayan languages has been interpreted as demonstrating that other Mesoamerican languages may have been borrowing words from Proto-Nahuan (or its early descendants) significantly earlier than previously thought, bolstering the possibility of a significant Nahuatl presence at Teotihuacan.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} regarding the ancestry {{of the founders of}} the Western Ganga dynasty (prior to the 4th century). Some mythical accounts point to a northern origin, while theories based on <b>epigraphy</b> suggest a southern origin. Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan (prior to their rise to power) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka, the Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu or of the southern districts of modern Andhra Pradesh. These regions encompass an area of the southern Deccan where the three modern states merge geographically. It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the northern king Samudra Gupta prior to 350, and carved out a kingdom for themselves. The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of Mysore, Hassan Chamarajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state. At times, they also controlled some areas in modern Tamil Nadu (Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita) and Andhra Pradesh (Ananthpur region starting from the middle of the 5th century). The founding king of the dynasty was Konganivarma Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit {{could turn into a}} scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early <b>epigraphy</b> and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of the}} community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E
50|$|All {{the early}} Pallava royal {{inscriptions}} are either in Sanskrit or in Prakrit language, considered the official languages of the dynasty while the official scripts were Pallava script and later Grantha. Similarly, inscriptions found in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka State are in Sanskrit and Prakrit. The phenomenon of using Prakrit as official languages in which rulers left their inscriptions and <b>epigraphies</b> continued till the 6th century. It {{would have been}} in the interest of the ruling elite to protect their privileges by perpetuating their hegemony of Prakrit in order to exclude the common people from sharing power (Mahadevan 1995a: 173-188). The Pallavas in their Tamil country used Tamil and Sanskrit in their inscriptions.|$|R
40|$|Research {{materials}} will {{be drawn}} from four sources: various local historical resources, <b>epigraphies,</b> Daoist canon and popular literature like Tang strange writings. The project will make full use of <b>epigraphies</b> of local Daoist monasteries {{in the area of}} Chuzhou and local gazetteers of Zhejiang Province which inform historical development of the Ye Fashan cult in the region. This study begins with the attempts to reconstruct the history of Palace Chapel Daoist Priest Ye Fashan and his Daoist family through analyzing the <b>epigraphies</b> of Ye's father, grandfather and himself. Before he died, Ye donated his houses as Daoist monasteries, which earned the clan's social reputation in the local society of Chuzhou, as well as for his offspring and local Daoist priests in the monasteries. Between the late Tang and the Song period, Ye was later worshiped as both the ancestor and local deity by the Ye clan. Local people even built ancestral temple in the Daoist monastery. Furthermore, Ye also received ample worships in many Daoist monasteries across the Chuzhou region because of his typical cultural hero activities such as making rains and controlling drought. This thesis endeavors to explore the development of the local cult of Daoist priest Ye Fashan from the Tang Dynasty until the Song Dynasty. It aims at tracing the cult's historical and religious background within an academic context, which emphasizes studying history of Daoism and Daoist immortals in local society. Ye Fa-shan is revered as a Daoist deity in many hagiographical sources found in the Daoist canon. The image of Ye in the Daoist hagiography is deeply influenced by strange writings and novels flourished in Tang, which emphasize the esoteric activities and thaumaturgy of Ye. His image as a Ritual Master in such narratives actually reflects the religious memory of the Tang people. Ye's esoteric image was further re-figured by new schools of Daoist ritual in the Song period. Ye was believed to be an important initiator of the Fu and Fa which were Daoist techniques to summon spirits and exorcise evils. In this thesis, the purpose of a biographical study of Ye Fashan is to acquire an archeological understanding of a Daoist cult between the Tang and the Song periods. Through an in-depth understanding of the popular literature and Daoist canon, the dissertation will try to reconstruct Ye's multiple images in local imagination and Daoist sources. 吳真. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 203 - 218).

50|$|There {{are many}} rock relief sculptures {{dating to the}} 8th-9th century A.D. in the area, {{including}} the rock cut image of Bhagawan Parshwanatha flanked by two Yaksha, {{as well as many}} other rock cut images of other tirthankaras.The area is known for the Jain cave temple and architecture. There are a number of Jain images with labels in vattezhuthu script. The epigraphs mentions the name of the donors,of the figures, of the provisions made for the offerings, etc. The main deity of the hill was called Araimalai Alwar. The other figures were caused to be made by the followers of Jain faith from a number of villages nearby. The sculptures were caused to be made in memory of the departed souls. There are approximately one hundred and fifty relief sculptures. Among the donors were the carpenters, potters, smiths, cultivators and other workers. A number of others were high ranking persons bearing the titles of Enadi, Etti and Kavidi. Provisions are also recorded for expounding Jain siddhanta a Gunasagara bhattara a great Jain ascetic lived here. The sculptures and the epigraphs are to be assigned to the reign of Pandya, Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (A.D768-800). From different <b>epigraphies</b> it is found that they belong to different era and the place became extinct after the 13th century due to loss of Patronage after Pandya kings.|$|R

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} Vishnu temples and iconography probably {{were already in}} existence by the 1st century BCE.

25|$|The largest jedar at Ternaten is {{the only}} one in that group {{sufficiently}} intact to display <b>epigraphy</b> and iconography. It contained large well-executed polychrome murals (now almost completely weathered away) of religious scenes typical of Mediterranean Christian iconography of the 5th century or later, indicating that the ruling class had by then become Christian. This jedar also contains many Latin inscriptions on recycled tombstones and other building material, dating from the time of Septimius Severus (202-203 CE) up to 494 CE. The source of this recycled material is not known with certainty, but there are several large ruins of cities and necropoli in the surrounding districts.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} academic {{debate over the}} real chronology of the chapters of the Quran. Carole Hillenbrand holds that there are several remaining tasks for the Orientalist Quranic scholars: Few Quranic scholars have worked on the <b>epigraphy</b> of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem whose foundation inscription dates to 72/692 and the antique Quran recently discovered in the Yemen, the Sana'a manuscripts. The Carbon-14 tests applied to this Quran date its parchment to 645-690 AD with 95 percent accuracy. Their real age {{may be a good}} deal younger, since C-14 estimates the time of growth of an organism, and the process from that to the final writing on the parchment involves an unknown amount of time, and parchments were also re-used often. Paleography has dated the San'a manuscripts to 690-750 AD.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{agree that}} Aix was born from its sources {{of water to}} Ancient Rome, on {{the remains of a}} Celtic habitat. The first {{occupation}} of the site has been dated by Alain Canal to the first century BCE, however there is nothing to suggest these remains were a fixed habitat. We are left with the remains in public institutions and {{it would be difficult to}} draw a sketch of ancient Aquae. The administrative situation of the place is known by <b>epigraphy,</b> which teaches us that Aix was, in the 1st century AD, a vicus, with a board of decemlecti (a council of ten members), and was administratively part of Vienne. Some citizens lived there with, apparently, quite important resources to offer to the gods, a sacred wood, a vine or to build a funeral arch for the case of the Campanii family.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} of the Church's history, celibacy was {{considered}} optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many {{that most of the}} Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that bishops, presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. It is also clear from <b>epigraphy,</b> the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature {{of the life of the}} Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{exquisite}} and obscure artifacts unearthed to date are the small, square steatite (soapstone) seals engraved with human or animal motifs. A large number of seals have been found at such sites as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. Many bear pictographic inscriptions generally {{thought to be a}} form of writing or script. Despite the efforts of philologists {{from all parts of the}} world, and despite the use of modern cryptographic analysis, the signs remain undeciphered. It is also unknown if they reflect proto-Dravidian or other non-Vedic language(s). The ascription of Indus Valley Civilization iconography and <b>epigraphy</b> to historically known cultures is extremely problematic, in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence of such claims, as well as the projection of modern South Asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area. This is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of Harappan material culture as seen from both Pakistan- and India-based scholars.|$|E
