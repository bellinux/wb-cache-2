5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> was carried out.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> {{unlike those}} on Royal Navy carriers, was {{superimposed}} on the ship's hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting the carrier's hull structure. A system {{of lights and}} mirrors along the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> assisted pilots in landing on the carrier.|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of the <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E

5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E

5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|From 2003, A320's feature {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) units in the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the {{original}} cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include the main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which was an analog display prior to this.|$|E

5|$|Its design also {{included}} a full glass cockpit rather than the hybrid versions found in previous airliners. The A320's <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> is equipped with Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) with side-stick controllers. The A320 features an Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) which gives the flight crew information about all the systems of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> for launch.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversion}} of Akagi began on 19 November 1923, and {{was completed in}} March 1927. However, the strange assortment of <b>flight</b> <b>decks</b> fitted on Akagi—a main landing deck superimposed over two short take-off decks—proved unsatisfactory, and the ship was withdrawn from active service in 1935 for modernization. The lower two <b>flight</b> <b>decks</b> were removed, the main deck was lengthened to , and a third elevator was added. Refitting was completed in 1938. Akagi supported operations off China in early 1939 and 1940, and underwent an overhaul in November 1940.|$|R
5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese <b>flight</b> <b>decks</b> at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his <b>flight</b> <b>decks</b> and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to ditch their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} to have been {{equipped}} with two 82m-long hangar decks for wheeled aircraft and a third 128m-long hangar deck for seaplanes; all of the hangars were 18.5m wide. The <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> would have been 128.5m long and 18.7m wide. All three of the hangars and <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> were intended to have been mounted above the main structural deck. The ship's designers intended to mount a take off deck on the bow, which would have been 30m long and 10.5m wide. According to naval historian Erich Gröner, the ship was designed to carry either 13 fixed-wing or 19 folding-wing seaplanes, along with around 10 wheeled aircraft. Rene Greger estimated the ship to carry eight to ten fighter aircraft and a combination of fifteen to twenty bombers and torpedo-floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat.

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|From 6 January to 15 August 1941, Saratoga {{underwent}} a long-deferred modernization at the Bremerton Navy Yard {{that included the}} widening of her <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> at her bow and the installation of additional antiaircraft guns and a CXAM-1 radar. The ship began a refit {{a few days later}} that lasted until late November, further revising the anti-aircraft armament and added a FC radar.|$|E
