5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E

This study uses action research methodology to examine one teachers three year pedagogical journey to differentiate curriculum and instruction for gifted and talented students. The strategies implemented include: acceleration, compacting and tiered lessons, extensions, and enrichments. Data, {{in the form of}} lesson planning, student work, teacher journals and student interviews, was collected to compare the instructional delivery before, during, and after a year of professional development focused on how {{to meet the needs of}} gifted and talented elementary students. The results suggest that if teachers are given the professional development needed, gifted students will have better attitudes towards school and learning.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} state of <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> in New Zealand following the 2008 change in government and consequent shift in educational priorities. This case study examines the provision of <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> in a full, co-educational primary school in a provincial area. Data gathered {{from a variety of}} stakeholders indicate that, in its recent history, the school’s provision varied considerably – from applying a structured, whole-school approach to lacking official policies and practices, to re-establishing school-wide provision. Provision was dependent on management priorities that often echoed national priorities that took the focus off of gifted and talented learners. These findings suggest that if national priorities do not explicitly include gifted and talented learners along with learners with special educational needs, then these students may be left vulnerable as schools shift their focus elsewhere. Recommendations for further research and effective provision of <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> are included...|$|R
50|$|Test anxiety {{can also}} be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, {{situational}} anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert. When one experiences too much anxiety, however, it can result in emotional or physical distress, difficulty concentrating, and emotional worry. Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations {{create a sense of}} threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function. Researchers suggest that between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety. Students with disabilities and students in <b>gifted</b> <b>educations</b> classes tend to experience high rates of test anxiety. Students who experience test anxiety tend to be easily distracted during a test, experience difficulty with comprehending relatively simple instructions, and have trouble organizing or recalling relevant information.|$|R

25|$|Another {{facet of}} this {{controversy}} is {{the effectiveness of}} the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. <b>Gifted</b> <b>Education</b> is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for.

As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Singapore's economy {{started to}} prosper, {{and the focus}} of Singapore's {{education}} system shifted from quantity to quality.
