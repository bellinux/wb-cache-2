5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} mylonite and schist. The Barranca Blanca <b>ignimbrite</b> is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi <b>Ignimbrite</b> overlies the Barranca Blanca <b>ignimbrite.</b> It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an <b>ignimbrite</b> erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle <b>ignimbrite.</b> On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{rocks at}} Irruputuncu are lavas {{that have been}} dated by potassium-argon dating to 10.8 ± 0.6 mya. The oldest {{component}} clearly belonging to the volcano is the El Pozo <b>ignimbrite</b> that was erupted 258.2 ± 48.8 ka, forming a multi-layered <b>ignimbrite</b> that was probably generated by the injection of new, hot magma into older, cooler magma. A lava dome on the upper flank {{on the western side}} of the volcano is 0.14 ± 0.04 mya old. The block-and-ash flow between 55.9 ka and 140 ka old, but has not been pecisely dated. The Crater lavas are 55.9 ± 26.8 ka old. The block-and-ash flow on the southwestern flank was formed 1570 ± 900 years BP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ignimbrites</b> may be white, grey, pink, beige, {{brown or}} black {{depending}} on their composition and density. Many pale <b>ignimbrites</b> are dacitic or rhyolitic. Darker coloured <b>ignimbrites</b> may be densely welded volcanic glass or, less commonly, mafic in composition.|$|R
25|$|Magma {{generation}} in the APVC is periodical, with pulses recognized 10, 8, 6, and 4 mya. The first stage included the Artola, Granada, Lower Rio San Pedro and Mucar <b>ignimbrites.</b> The second pulse involved the Panizos, Sifon and Vilama <b>ignimbrites</b> {{and the third}} was the largest, {{with a number of}} <b>ignimbrites.</b> The fourth pulse was weaker than the preceding ones and involved the Patao and Talabre <b>ignimbrites</b> among others.|$|R
50|$|Cerro Verde {{inside the}} caldera is a dome {{formed by the}} {{uplifting}} of the Verde <b>ignimbrites</b> in the caldera after their deposition and cooling. Cerro Aguas Calientes was formed {{in the same way}} from the Tajmar <b>ignimbrites,</b> conclusions based in both cases on the outward dip of the <b>ignimbrites</b> contained in the domes.|$|R
5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul. That timespan {{coincides with the}} deposition of tephra from volcanoes in Italy in Europe; {{it is possible that}} tephra also came from Ciomadul. Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian <b>Ignimbrite.</b> Some tephra layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may have originated at Ciomadul.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{that makes}} up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of <b>ignimbrite</b> (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation. It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} {{occurred in the}} late Miocene, about 7million years ago. The resulting stratum, the Rattlesnake Formation, lies {{on top of the}} Mascall and is capped by an <b>ignimbrite.</b> The Rattlesnake stratum has fossils of mastodons, camels, rhinoceroses, the ancestors of dogs, lions, bears, and horses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.|$|E
2500|$|Petrologically, <b>ignimbrites</b> {{are derived}} from dacitic–rhyodacitic magmas. Phenocrysts include biotite, Fe–Ti-oxides, {{plagioclase}} and quartz with minor apatite and titanite. Northern Puna <b>ignimbrites</b> also contain amphibole, and clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene occur in low-Si magmas, while higher Si magmas also contain sanidine. These magmas have temperatures of [...] and originate in depths of [...] The <b>ignimbrites</b> are collectively referred to as San Bartolo and Silapeti Groups.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ignimbrites</b> {{are made}} of a very poorly sorted mixture of {{volcanic}} ash (or tuff when lithified) and pumice lapilli, commonly with scattered lithic fragments. The ash is composed of glass shards and crystal fragments. <b>Ignimbrites</b> may be loose and unconsolidated, or lithified (solidified) rock called lapilli-tuff. Near the volcanic source, <b>ignimbrites</b> commonly contain thick accumulations of lithic blocks, and distally, many show meter-thick accumulations of rounded cobbles of pumice.|$|R
50|$|Petrologically, <b>ignimbrites</b> {{are derived}} from dacitic-rhyodacitic magmas. Phenocrysts include biotite, Fe-Ti-oxides, {{plagioclase}} and quartz with minor apatite and titanite. Northern Puna <b>ignimbrites</b> also contain amphibole, and clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene occur in low-Si magmas, while higher Si magmas also contain sanidine. These magmas have temperatures of 700 - 850 C and originate in depths of 4 - 8 km. The <b>ignimbrites</b> are collectively referred to as San Bartolo and Silapeti Groups.|$|R
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the <b>ignimbrite</b> sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or <b>ignimbrite</b> systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E
5|$|The first {{volcanic}} activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 {{years ago and}} formed the Tuzgle <b>Ignimbrite.</b> Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and {{volcanic activity}} may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs {{are associated with the}} volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain. Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano.|$|E
50|$|Guaichane-Mamuta is {{constructed}} on the mid-Miocene Altos de Nama formation, which is formed by <b>ignimbrites.</b> Mamuta itself {{was also the}} origin of <b>ignimbrites.</b> Older pyroclastics from the same centre contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase.|$|R
50|$|Cerro Alconcha is an andesitic volcano in the Andes. The volcano {{is buried}} by <b>ignimbrites</b> which on its {{northern}} side reach {{an altitude of}} 300 m. These <b>ignimbrites</b> constrain the volcano's age as older than 9.3 mya.|$|R
5000|$|The {{volcanic}} complex reaches {{an altitude}} of approximately 3800 m. Breccia, <b>ignimbrites,</b> lava domes and lava flows have been described at La Hoyada. The <b>ignimbrites</b> cover a surface area of 5 km2. The volcanic complex has been affected by faulting.|$|R
5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera <b>ignimbrite,</b> at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary <b>ignimbrite</b> flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
25|$|Vilama <b>Ignimbrite,</b> 8.4–8.5 mya.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} beneath La Pacana {{is formed}} by sediments of Ordovician age, Devonian-Permian quartzites, the mixed Salta formation also of Permian age and sediments of Cretaceous-Tertiary age. At the eastern margin of La Pacana in Argentina, they overlay an even older Precambrian basement. Most of this original basement however {{is covered by}} Miocene <b>ignimbrites</b> from centres that may coincide with the La Pacana caldera. Two of these older <b>ignimbrites</b> are known as the Pampa Múcar and Antigua Chacaliri <b>ignimbrites.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ignimbrites</b> {{deposited}} during eruptions of APVC volcanoes {{are formed}} by [...] "boiling over" [...] eruptions, where magma chambers containing viscous crystal-rich volatile-poor magmas partially empty in tranquil, non-explosive fashion. As a result, the deposits are massive and homogeneous and show few size segregation or fluidization features. Such eruptions have been argued to require external triggers to occur. There is a volume-dependent relationship between homogeneity of the eruption products and their volume; large volume <b>ignimbrites</b> have uniform mineralogical and compositional heterogeneity. Small volume <b>ignimbrites</b> often show gradation in composition. This pattern {{has been observed}} in other volcanic centres such as the Fish Canyon Tuff in the United States and the Toba <b>ignimbrites</b> in Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>ignimbrites</b> are silicic, with {{generally}} over 65% SiO2. The {{chemistry of}} the <b>ignimbrites,</b> like all felsic rocks, {{and the resultant}} mineralogy of phenocryst populations within them, is related mostly to the varying contents of sodium, potassium, calcium, the lesser amounts of iron and magnesium.|$|R

50|$|Luingo {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). About 20 major calderas {{are found}} in the CVZ, {{especially}} in the region between 21 and 25° southern latitude where the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex can be found. These <b>ignimbrites,</b> lava flows and subvolcanic bodies. Smaller <b>ignimbrites</b> are found {{in the southern part of}} the CVZ.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Luingo occurred before {{a phase of}} crustal thickening in the region. It generated two major <b>ignimbrites</b> named Alto de Las Lagunas an Pucarilla. Two further <b>ignimbrites</b> named Luingo I and Luingo II were found within the caldera and are associated with caldera collapse. A phase of effusive activity succeded the caldera formation.|$|R
