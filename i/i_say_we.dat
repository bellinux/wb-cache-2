500|$|Humphrey's {{progress}} with {{civil rights in}} Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions. In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent's 52,000 votes. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank. In his address, he said, [...] "There {{are those who say}} to you– we are rushing this issue of civil rights. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> are 172 years late. There are those who say– this issue of civil rights is an infringement on states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic Party {{to get out of the}} shadow of state's rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights." [...] Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate in the 1948 election and served many years as a prominent Minnesota politician, including Vice President of the U.S. from 1965–1969.|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, reports {{speculated that}} Knight {{requested}} {{to be released}} from his contract and that [...] "they were working out the details" [...] at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely grateful to {{have had the opportunity to}} play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors. He is an incredibly talented actor and a person whose strength of character is admired by all of us." ...|$|E
