The emergence {{of the internet and}} the increase in overall connectivity means that data is more easily accessible and available. Using the available data in a security context may provide a system with an external contextual insight such as environmental awareness or current affair awareness. A security information and event management (SIEM) system is a security system that correlates security event <b>information</b> <b>from</b> <b>surrounding</b> systems and decides whether the surrounding environment (possibly an enterprise's network) is vulnerable or even under attack by a malicious person whether they be internal (authorised) or external (unauthorised).

There are various context information types used in this thesis, namely: social media, meteorological, calendar information and terror threat level. The SIEM is tested with each contextual data feed active and the results are recorded. The testing shows that the addition of contextual data feeds actively affects the sensitivity of OSSIM and hence results in higher alarms raised during elevated context triggered states.

40|$|Abstract: Earthquakes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{unpredictable}} natural hazards but recently short-lead-time Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS) have become practical with a system operating in Japan and another planned for operation in California in the next year or two. A few seconds to a minute or so of early warning is achievable. For example, if appropriate, an early warning can be broadcast to enhance the effectiveness of evacuations, water and gas supplies can be temporarily cut off, and other more advanced engineering applications may also be developed. Due to the limited warning time and the uncertainty of the <b>information</b> <b>from</b> an EEWS, applications that require real-time human decision-making are not practical. This motivates recent research to develop a robust automated rapid decision-making procedure for mitigation actions. A rational procedure is to initiate a potential loss-reduction action if, based on the <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> an EEWS, the expected loss from taking no action is greater than the expected loss from taking the mitigation action. To estimate the expected loss of a predicted event, it is proposed to use the recently developed PEER performance-based earthquake engineering methodology...|$|R

40|$|Signals {{representing}} the value assigned to stimuli {{at the time}} of choice have been repeatedly observed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet it remains unknown how these value representations are computed from sensory and memory representations in more posterior brain regions. We used electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects evaluated appetitive and aversive food items to study how event-related responses modulated by stimulus value evolve over time. We found that value-related activity shifted from posterior to anterior, and from parietal to central to frontal sensors, across three major time windows after stimulus onset: 150 - 250 ms, 400 - 550 ms, and 700 - 800 ms. Exploratory localization of the EEG signal revealed a shifting network of activity moving from sensory and memory structures to areas associated with value coding, with stimulus value activity localized to vmPFC only from 400 ms onwards. Consistent with these results, functional connectivity analyses also showed a causal flow of <b>information</b> <b>from</b> temporal cortex to vmPFC. Thus, although value signals are present as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset, the value signals in vmPFC appear relatively late in the choice process, and seem to reflect the integration of <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> sensory and memory related regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{experiences}} with Concept Mapping at Langara College, {{a theory of}} information transfer between short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) is proposed. A neuron-network/mathematical model based on Rummelhart's connectionist theory (1989) is proposed as to identify the process in which elements of LTM encode new <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> STM. <b>Information</b> in LTM is viewed in connectionist analogy in which pieces of information are integrated together. Learning is explained via mathematical models presenting changes in connection between incoming STM units and LTM. Relevance (a mathematical/theoretical construct) is proposed as a necessary facilitator for successful integration and accommodation of STM unit(s) by LTM to occur. Each STM information unit must be compatible with its counterpart(s) in LTM in order for successful integration to occur. An STM unit can simultaneously be connected and integrated to descriptive, semantic and declarative memories or episodic memories. More "connections " between the STM unit and different types of memories in LTM increases speed and efficiency of recall. The final section draws {{a comparison of the}} theoretical perspective discussed in the paper with the learning process in concept-mapping.

40|$|Diminished {{connectivity}} between midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei and {{prefrontal cortex}} {{has been suggested}} to contribute to cognitive deficits that are detectable even in early stages of schizophrenia. The midline-intralaminar relay cells comprise the final link in the ascending arousal pathway and are selectively excited by the wake-promoting peptides hypocretin 1 and 2 (orexin A and B). This excitation occurs both {{at the level of}} the relay cell bodies and their axon terminals within prefrontal cortex. In rat brain slices, the release of glutamate from midline-intralaminar thalamocortical terminals induces excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer V pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex. When hypocretin is infused into medial prefrontal cortex of behaving animals, it improves performance in a complex cognitive task requiring divided attention. Chronic restraint stress causes atrophy of the apical dendritic arbors in layer V prefrontal pyramidal cells and leads to a reduction in hypocretin-induced EPSCs, indicating impairment in excitatory thalamocortical transmission. Thus, taken together with evidence for an underlying loss of excitatory thalamocortical connectivity in schizophrenia, stress in this illness could further exacerbate a breakdown in cortical processing of <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> the ascending arousal system.

40|$|Past {{studies found}} that the {{perception}} of 3 D structure from moving images only involves {{the analysis of the}} first-order optic flow. Accordingly, current structure-from-motion models map the properties of the instantaneous velocity field into 3 D properties like orientation, depth, and motion. The present study shows that this purely instantaneous analysis of the optic flow cannot completely account for human 3 D perception. Instead, we propose a model that combines the <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> the instantaneous velocity field with a preexisting representation of the 3 D orientation of the derived surface at each instant of time. To test this model, we conducted three experiments in which observers compared the slant of two rotating surfaces specified by the motion of random-dots, and judged which surface was more rotated in depth. These surfaces had different past histories (Experiment 1), oscillated at different frequencies (Experiment 2), or had velocity fields that varied over time, e. g., decreasing over time (Experiment 3). The results show that this model is a better predictor of human performance than an instantaneous model, as revealed through simulations.

Active processing takes place in working memory, popularly associated with Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) multicomponent working memory model. According to this model, <b>incoming</b> <b>information</b> <b>from</b> the environment is temporarily stored to perform verbal and nonverbal tasks.

Phonological information refers to the sounds of language (e. g., speech), that occur in a phonological store and are maintained there by rehearsal via an articulatory loop. Yet, the storage of phonological information in the multicomponent working memory model does not account for all auditory information (e. g., music). Research investigating this discrepancy has produced inconclusive findings. Whether or not phonological and non-linguistic auditory information share a structure for storage in working memory is still unknown. The current study benefits from the utilization of an auditory interference task to help rectify this inconsistency. Results indicate that linguistic and musical information do not completely share a storage mechanism in the multicomponent working memory model, however, they are not completely separate either. Also, musicians and non-musicians may exhibit different cognitive underpinnings in the storage of linguistic and musical information...|$|R
