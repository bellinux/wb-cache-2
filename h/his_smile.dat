25|$|Artemis is {{described}} as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair. He is said to resemble his father.

A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> is called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands. Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit. He often wears Armani suits. It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in The Time Paradox. As of , Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal's attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race.

It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes on one foot.|$|E
500|$|... was an {{impulsive}} young man. From rare {{photographs and}} {{the testimony of}} his contemporaries emerges [...] a figure of medium stature, with slightly drooped shoulders, thick brown hair, and a pale oval face. His eyebrows were dark, {{and one of them}} was almost always raised, giving his face an expression of intense irony. His eyes burned with constant passion, and his lips were full and sensuous. There was also something young and vulnerable in <b>his</b> <b>smile.</b> He smiled often, and his conversation was reputed to be brilliant.|$|E
500|$|Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called Brian's antics [...] "creepy", {{particularly}} <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> {{at the end}} of {{the episode}}. Despite this, Davinger complimented the episode for focusing on one single plot. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that [...] "Junior Salesman"—along with [...] "Vandalism"—was [...] "so much sharper than last week's trial in Dullsville". Campbell also complimented the return of Michael Schur as Mose and the performances of Matt L. Jones and Brian Baumgartner. Multiple critics considered the episode superior to [...] "Vandalism", particularly due to their displeasure with the Brian-Pam storyline, which was more prevalent in [...] "Vandalism".|$|E

500|$|Suman was {{confirmed}} in March 2006 {{to play the}} role of Adiseshan after Amitabh Bachchan, Prakash Raj and Mohanlal were considered. Sathyaraj said he declined the role because, [...] "After a film of the calibre of Mr. Bharath with Rajnikanth, I couldn't settle for anything less. So I didn't accept Sivaji." [...] For his role, Suman removed his moustache and used dentures to make <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> visible. Shankar instructed one of the costume designers to give the character a spotless white dhoti, shirt, shoes, a Rolex watch and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Prior to this, Suman had acted with Rajinikanth in Thee (1981). Subbu Panchu Arunachalam, son of filmmaker Panchu Arunachalam, dubbed for Suman.

He {{explained}} to fans {{that he was}} informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury {{and that he had}} to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted {{that he was going to}} have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he [...] "had to find <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] somewhere down the line.

500|$|Formby {{returned}} to Britain at Christmas and appeared in Dick Whittington at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, {{he appeared in}} variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, The Times thought Formby was [...] "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. <b>His</b> <b>smile,</b> though fixed, is winning, and his songs... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying [...] "when I look back {{on some of the}} films I've done in the past {{it makes me want to}} cringe. I'm afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I'm only going to do variety". He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in Cinderella at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.|$|E

In 2002, Fukui and Sekito decided to arrange some of the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu, the primary composer for {{the music of the}} Final Fantasy series. Uematsu, a fan of rock music, enjoyed these arrangements, and Fukui and Sekito asked him to join them in making a rock band. Declining at first due to feeling too busy with his composing duties and attempts to become a music producer with <b>his</b> <b>Smile</b> Please label, Uematsu agreed to join them in a single live performance as a keyboardist. At the performance, Uematsu felt a [...] "mix of stage fright and excitement, [...] all the crowds cheering, the audience paying full attention", and decided to join the two in making a band; Fukui and Sekito had refused to start one if Uematsu was not involved as one of the musicians.|$|E
500|$|Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) {{built on}} the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian {{pressured}} into committing crime as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman's interference causes him to leap into a chemical vat, which disfigures him. This, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, causes him to go insane and become the Joker. However, the Joker says that this story may not be true, as he prefers his past to be [...] "multiple choice". In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon and tortures her father, Commissioner James Gordon, {{to prove that it}} only takes one bad day to drive a normal man insane. After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman. Following the character's maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in Birds of Prey by shattering the Joker's teeth and destroying <b>his</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E

People magazine named Usher the [...] "Sexiest R Star" [...] in 1998, with singer Monica who said on stage sexiness was manifest in [...] "his movements, his gestures, the way he expresses his lyrics."

2500|$|As another {{distinguishing}} feature, Bassarabescu replaces Caragiale's sarcasm with a [...] "lyrical", [...] "tenderly grotesque", layer, {{while offering}} [...] "the surprise of a humane bedding" [...] within the provincial soul. <b>His</b> <b>smile,</b> Victor Eftimiu notes, was one [...] "of compassion", his gaze [...] "filtered by tears", {{like that of}} a Romanian Anton Chekhov. Literary critic Eugen Lovinescu finds, in most of Bassarabescu's writings, [...] "the same family atmosphere with its links of solidarity, with all the hardships of finding their daughters husbands, with sisters that will devour each other out of love, with brothers that will carry on their shoulders the maintenance of their entire household". This, Lovinescu believes, was the quintessential [...] "Romanian family" [...] of the urban milieu, with only a lack of [...] "fantasy" [...] and failure at pacing preventing Bassarabescu from producing the great Romanian urban novel.

[...] His opinions were highly regarded among his peers and according to Douchet, [...] " [...] was the great talker. He was the group's secret soul, the occult thinker, a bit of a censor." [...] Godard said, [...] "I might like a film very much, but if Rivette said 'It's no good' then I would agree with him ... it was as though he had a privileged access to cinematographic truth." [...] Truffaut considered Rivette his best friend, and they were frequently seen at screenings. Truffaut said that in the 1950s, Rivette was {{the only member of the}} group already capable of directing a feature film.|$|E
