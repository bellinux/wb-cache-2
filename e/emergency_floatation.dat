25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, <b>emergency</b> <b>floatation</b> equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
2500|$|Airbus Helicopters has {{promoted}} the airframe's various configurations as possessing [...] "unique adaptability" [...] for various missions, including utility work, commercial transportation, and training roles. Equipment {{for the law}} enforcement role include external loudspeakers, rappelling system, search lights with laser pointers, left or right-mounted hoists, and electro-optical sensors. For offshore oil & gas operations, the rotorcraft can be fitted with weather/search radars, <b>emergency</b> <b>floatation</b> aids (including an automated external life raft), energy-absorbent seating, class-D certified external hoists, and crash-resistant fuel cells. An external hook can be installed to carry underslung loads of up to 272kg for cargo missions. In a training capacity, features such a light aircraft recording system (for post-flight analysis), intuitive human-machine interface, specific training modules, and a one-engine inoperative training mode, and full ground simulators, may be selected.|$|E
50|$|It {{featured}} a redesigned wing cellule with no stagger {{and an extra}} set of struts inboard, facilitating folding for stowage, a modified fuselage that carried <b>emergency</b> <b>floatation</b> gear, and main undercarriage that could be folded for stowage on the WB.IIIF. Later examples, designated WB.IIID could jettison their undercarriage for safer water landings.|$|E
50|$|In July 1939, Loire-Nieuport had {{received}} orders for 36 LN.401 production dive bombers for the Navy, and 36 LN.411 aircraft for the Army. The LN.411 was {{almost identical to}} the LN.401, except for the deletion of the arrestor hook, the wing folding mechanism and the <b>emergency</b> <b>floatation</b> devices. The first LN.411s were delivered in September which coincided with an order {{from the air force}} for 270 more but in October they were refused, and the LN.411s were sent to the Navy.|$|E
