25|$|During the Hook and Cod wars in Holland in the 15th century, the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>supported</b> {{the bourgeoisie}} {{in the cities}} (Cod) in their fight against the nobility in the {{countryside}} (Hook). During these wars Amsterdam loaned {{large amounts of money}} to Maximilian I. In 1489, the emperor gave Amsterdam the right to use his personal imperial crown in its coat of arms, out of gratitude for these loans. When his successor Rudolf II created a new personal crown, Amsterdam changed the crown accordingly. Even after the Reformation, the Protestant Amsterdam continued to use the crown of the Catholic emperor. In 1804, the crown of Rudolf II became the Imperial Crown of Austria. In the coat of arms of Amsterdam, the Imperial Crown is positioned on top of the escutcheon.|$|E
25|$|The Casket {{letters were}} eight letters and some sonnets {{said to have}} been written by Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Earl of Bothwell, between January and April 1567. They were {{produced}} as evidence against Queen Mary by the Scottish lords who opposed her rule. In particular, the text of the letters was taken to imply that Queen Mary colluded with Bothwell in the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. Mary's contemporary supporters, including Adam Blackwood dismissed them as complete forgeries or letters written by the Queen's servant Mary Beaton. The authenticity of the letters, now known only by copies, continues to be debated. Some historians argue that they were forgeries concocted in order to discredit Queen Mary, and ensure that Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>supported</b> the kingship of the infant James VI of Scotland, rather than his mother. The historian John Hungerford Pollen, in 1901, by comparing two genuine letters drafted by Mary, presented a subtle argument that the various surviving copies and translations of the casket letters could not be used as evidence of their original authorship by Mary.|$|E

2500|$|In Hudson v. McMillian, a {{prisoner}} had been beaten, garnering a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although {{these were not}} [...] "serious injuries", the court believed, it held that [...] "the use of excessive physical force against {{a prisoner}} may constitute {{cruel and unusual punishment}} even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury." [...] Dissenting, Thomas wrote that, in his view, [...] "a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents." [...] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion). Thomas's opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority of the court, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, Thomas's opinion ignored [...] "the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment". According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a [...] "classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him". Thomas would later respond to the accusation [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>supported</b> the beating of prisoners in that case.
