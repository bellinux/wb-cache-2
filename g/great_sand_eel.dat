50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is {{native to}} the eastern North Atlantic from Murmansk (70°N) and Spitzbergen (75°N) southwards to Portugal (38°N) {{including}} Iceland and the Baltic Sea. It has not been recorded from the Mediterranean Sea or the Barents Sea. It {{is to be found}} from the low water mark down to over 100 m, typically over clean and sandy substrates.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the lesser sand eel because the origin of its long dorsal fin is located behind {{the level of the}} pectoral fin. Corbin's sand eel (Hyperoplus immaculatus) is very similar to the greater sand eel in the way that it lacks a protrusible upper jaw and its similar size. However, it can {{be distinguished}} by the lack of the black spot on the snout, but it does have a black chin. Its dorsal fin has 59 to 62 rays. The overall color is darker than the other sand eels, it is found offshore, and tends to be found more on the western side of the United Kingdom ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>eel</b> or sandeel is {{the common}} name used for a {{considerable}} number of species of fish. Most of them are sea fish of the genera Hyperoplus (<b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>eels),</b> Gymnammodytes or Ammodytes. Many species are found off the western coasts of Europe from Spain to Scotland, and in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.|$|R
50|$|The body of {{the lesser}} <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> has an {{elongated}} shape with a rounded cross section. The head is also elongated and pointed, and the sharp prominent lower jaw projects further than the upper jaw. When the mouth is opened, the two jaws form a tube through which food is sucked in. The top of the fish's mouth lacks teeth. The scales of the belly make a chevron pattern. The dorsal fin is long and ribbon-like, the pectoral fins are small and low set, {{and there are no}} pelvic fins. The caudal fin is bifurcated in shape. The skin color is greenish yellow on the back, yellowish on the upper sides, and a mixture of a brilliant silver on the lower sides and belly. This fish can be distinguished from the <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> by its smaller size (less than 20 cm) {{and the fact that the}} origin of the long dorsal fin starts approximately in line with the tip of the pectoral fin.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> has an {{elongated}} body, with a rounded cross section. It has a long, pointed head, and a protruding lower jaw. [...] Its upper jaw, however, is not protrusible, and this species {{is unable to}} form a tube with its mouth. A monocle [...] "tooth-shaped" [...] structure {{can be found at}} the front of the palate. The scales on the body cannot form a chevron pattern. The skin ridge running the length of the sides of the body, spread as far as one-third of the base of the anal fin. Low and long set dorsal fins consist of 52 to 61 rays. The anal fin is about half the size of the dorsal fin, and taller. The pectoral fins are diminutive; the pelvic fins are absent. Color ranges from a lime color on the back and upper sides to the bright silver on the lower sides and the belly. Also, a specific black smudge occurs between the eyes and the snout, which is about the same size as the diameter of the eye.|$|E
40|$|This study determines Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) diet {{composition}} and prey size at two areas 6 kmapart, atBayLövstabukten, Sweden, in 2005. The study entails {{the examination of}} 333 pellets and 2, 669 regurgitated fish. To determine {{the size of the}} predated fish based onworn otoliths found in pellets, size-correction factorswere applied. Regression slopes between fish size and otolith size were applied to estimate the original size of the predated fish. Both pellet-based and regurgitated-fish-based analyses sug-gested the same dominating prey species by biomass. Based on pellets, Herring (Clupea harengus; 32. 5 %), European Perch (Perca fluviatilis; 20. 9 %) and Eelpout (Zoarces viviparus; 18. 5 %) dominated the diet. Regurgitated-fish samples contained species that were not found in pellets. These were mostly species with small and easily-eroding oto-liths, such as Three-spined Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and <b>Greater</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Eel</b> (Hyperoplus lanceolatus). Cormorant diet between the two areas differed, and within both areas there were gradual changes in diet composition between incubation, nestling, chick and fledgling phases. 1...|$|R
50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> (Ammodytes marinus), {{also known}} as the lesser <b>sand</b> <b>eel,</b> is a small semi-pelagic ray-finned fish found in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is member of the Ammodytidae family which {{includes}} all 31 species of <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> often referred to as sand lances. Contrary to their name <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> including Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel,</b> are not true eels and instead belong to the order of “perch-like” fishes, the Perciformes.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} lifestyle, {{it has been}} very {{difficult}} to estimate the population size of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel.</b> Most monitoring techniques are inappropriate and cannot detect the burrowed sand eels.Biological indicatiors, or bioindicators are now being used to assess the size of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> population. The main indicator used for <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> are black-legged kittiwake seabirds. These coastal breeding birds are heavily reliant on <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> and therefore their population size changes in response to the amount of Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> present. This can give a lot of information about the abundance of <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> in the area.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{overfishing}} of the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fishery in the North Sea {{off the coast of}} Scotland was closed down in 2000.An observed decline in Atlantic puffins was linked to reduced numbers of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> prey and the fishery was closed in the hope to recover the puffin population. After the closure the numbers of Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> increased and benefited many top predators including the black-legged kittiwake. The fishery continues to be closed except for a small area carefully managed to make assessments of the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> stock.These previous problems with Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fisheries and the concerns for seabirds, commercially valuable fish and marine mammals have led to calls for better management and monitoring of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> abundance.|$|R
50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{is known}} from fishing records to have regular {{population}} fluctuations. Overfishing, {{climate change and}} food web effects have all {{been shown to have}} contribute to these fluctuations. As the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is found in the North Atlantic Ocean its climate is altered by the North Atlantic Oscillation. This weather fluctuation can alter the recruitment of <b>sand</b> <b>eel.</b> Warmer temperatures decrease the number of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> juveniles that survive to adulthood and so yearly changes to temperature can cause fluctuating population size. Changes to the abundance of species connected to the Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in the food web has also caused variable population size. Calanus copepods are an important prey item for <b>sand</b> <b>eels.</b> The population of Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> has been related to changes in the availability of this prey. Young Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> have lower survival when copepods are less abundant.|$|R
50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{is found}} across the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and is {{particularly}} {{abundant in the}} North Sea. They live in both the shallow open ocean and coastal waters. Four other species of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> are also distributed {{in this part of}} the Atlantic. The fisheries here are dominated by Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> suggesting the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is the most abundant in the area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>eels</b> {{have been}} fished since the 1950s. However, {{this was not}} done for {{industrial}} purposes until the 1970s when the fishing fleet for <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> increased rapidly. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is the most abundant species of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in these fisheries and makes up over 90% of the catch. In 1977 the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> fishery became the largest fishery in the North Sea, with landings regularly exceeding 1 million tonnes. This high level of fishing caused a decline in stocks over time as the fishery became unsustainable. This led to both financial losses for the fishing industry and negative environmental consequences.|$|R
50|$|Fisheries of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{can also}} be harmful to seabird colonies. Fishing the Raitt's <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> means there are less {{available}} to be eaten by the seabirds. Populations of Atlantic puffin and black-legged kittiwake have declined in response to decreased prey levels of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> in the sea.|$|R
50|$|In the sea many larger {{fish species}} prey on the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{including}} cod, haddock, whiting, saithe and mackerel. Many {{of these are}} very commercially valuable species and declines in <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> have caused declines in their numbers {{due to lack of}} prey. Marine mammals also feed on Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> but less regularly. Mostly species such as grey seals, harbour seals and harbour porpoise consume lots of <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> in the Spring and early Summer.|$|R
50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> feed {{mainly on}} zooplankton. By {{consuming}} zooplankton {{they act as}} a link through to the higher trophic level predators that eat <b>sand</b> <b>eels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The three genera {{listed above}} all {{fall within the}} family Ammodytidae, the sand lances. Members of these genera found in other oceans are not usually called <b>sand</b> <b>eels,</b> and species {{from other parts of}} the world are known as <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> are usually less closely related. None of the <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> is related to the true eels.|$|R
50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is a {{keystone}} {{species in the}} North Sea food web. They are the prey of {{a significant number of}} species including seabirds, marine mammals and larger fish. Seabirds in particular rely heavily on the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> to feed their chicks. When the <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> leave their burrows to feed seabirds dive into the water to catch them and then return to their nests. Atlantic puffin, black-legged kittiwake, common guillemot and razorbills are all known predators of this species. Common guillemots feed exclusively on Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> during the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>eels</b> live amongst sandy {{sediment}} {{of the sea}} {{bed where}} they spend most the year burrowed avoiding predators. They are also found living in bedrock and kelp habitats. Sandbanks {{are the most important}} habitat for the <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> as they are used as nursery, spawning and resting grounds.Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> live in turbulent areas of the ocean and do not live in depths below 100m.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is predicted to move further North in the future due to climate change. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> survives better in cooler waters and may move North to avoid warming sea temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is still debated and its exact relationship to {{the other members of}} its order Perciformes is unknown.

50|$|Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> {{breed in}} December and January when they briefly leave their winter burrows in the sediment.They {{lay their eggs}} in the sand which {{incubate}} there until they hatch in February and March. The hatched <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> live in the open water above the sediment until metamorphosis. After this, they return to burrow in the sediment.Most Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> live for only 3 or 4 years as they have {{a high level of}} natural death.|$|R
50|$|The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> {{is a small}} {{elongated}} {{fish that}} is usually about 20 cm long. The maximum length reported for this species of <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> is 25 cm. They are silver all over with darker scales on their dorsal side.Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> have a short tail fin that is deeply forked. They have a long and low dorsal fin that is {{twice as long as}} the tail fin and runs along almost the entire body. The scales on their underside are arranged randomly instead of in a distinct pattern as in many other fish. The Raitt’s <b>sand</b> <b>eel</b> has a pointed jaw where the lower jaw projects further than the upper jaw.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>eels</b> form an {{important}} part of the diet of many sea birds. Excessive fishing of <b>sand</b> <b>eels</b> on an industrial scale in the North Sea has been linked to a decline in the breeding success of kittiwakes, terns, fulmars, and shags.|$|R
