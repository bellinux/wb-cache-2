40|$|A cold {{event at}} around 8200 {{calendar}} years BP and the release, at around that time, {{of a huge}} freshwater outburst from ice-dammed glacial Lake Agassiz have lent support {{to the idea that}} the flood triggered the cold event. Some suggest that the freshwater addition caused a weakening of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) thereby reducing the ocean transport of <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> northern latitudes. Although several modeling efforts lend strength to this claim, the paleoceanographic record is equivocal. The authors ’ aim is to use a coupled ocean–atmosphere model to examine the possibility that the two events are causally linked but that MOC reduction was not the main agent of change. It is found that the outburst flood and associated redirection of postflood meltwater drainage to the Labrador Sea, via Hudson Strait, can freshen the North Atlantic, leading to reduced salinity and sea surface temperature, and thus to increased sea ice production at high latitudes. The results point to the possibility that the preflood outflow to the St. Lawrence was extremely turbid and sufficiently dense to become hyperpycnal, whereas the postflood outflow through Hudson Strait had a lower load of suspended sediment and was buoyant. 1...|$|E

40|$|The optimum heat {{transfer}} condition for a tubular type solar receiver was investigated for various receiver pipe size, {{heat transfer}} fluid, and design requirement and constraint(s). Heat transfer {{of a single}} plain receiver pipe exposed to concentrated solar energy was modelled along the flow path of the heat transfer fluid. Three different working fluids, molten salt, sodium, and supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2) were considered in the case studies with different design conditions. The optimized ideal heat transfer condition was identified through fast iterative heat transfer calculations solving for all relevant radiation, conduction and convection heat transfers throughout the entire discretized tubular receiver. The ideal condition giving the best performance was obtained by finding the highest acceptable solar energy flux optimally distributed to meet different constraint(s), such as maximum allowable material temperature of receiver, maximum allowable film temperature of heat transfer fluid, and maximum allowable stress of receiver pipe material. The level of fluid side turbulence (represented by pressure drop in this study) was also optimized to give the highest net power production.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} low grade waste heat from {{industrial}} processes are not utilized, {{due to lack}} of heat integration equipment. Industrial processes tend to have specifications at high temperature lifts, that not are suited to be operated by conventional technology from residential heat pumps. Standard vapor compression heat pumps have undesirable high pressure ratios that are inefficient at high temperature lifts. Compression-absorption heat pumps use zeotropic working fluid mixtures that are suitable for temperatures between - 10 and + 160 ℃ at system pressures below 20 bar, which make them applicable for delivering <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> temperature processes. The advantages of the compression-absorption heat pumps, also known as the hybrid heat pump are the use of non-ozone depleting working fluid mixtures, reduced irreversibilities due to heat transfer with temperature glides, high temperature lifts, low pressure ratios and flexible capacity control. Two separate simulation models were developed comprising a two-stage CAHP system and an absorber model. The two-stage CAHP system used waste heat water at 50 ℃ as heat source and heat sink temperatures, with the objective of achieve maximum supply temperature at four different compressor discharge temperature limitations. The absorber model compared five different compact heat exchangers heating air in a cross-flow, where the main goal was to minimize the absorber height and the fan work. The two-stage process investigated the benefits of the desuperheater, where the supply temperatures with and without the desuperheater where nearly the same. Maximum supply temperatures were obtained at 171. 8 ℃ with a COP of 2. 08, when the maximum discharge temperature was set to 250 ℃. A correction factor was used for the intermediate pressure as K∙√(P_LP∙P_HP) The optimum K-factor increased at elevating absorber pressure from 1. 16 to 1. 35 at absorber pressure from 17 to 47. 5 bar. Simulations from the absorber model yielded much larger mass flow rate for the air than for the mixture. The heat exchange between the air and the mixture was sensitive to the absorber height and the air mass flow rate, which resulted in large pressure drops and fan work. Finned at tube heat exchangers gave the best results with respect to the absorber height and fan work. There is suggested to conduct further work with other heat sink and source temperatures and also optimize the temperature lift in the two stage model. Finned at tube heat exchangers could be further investigated in an absorber model with other dimensions and more accurate approaches for thermal resistance and fin efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{of climate}} change and {{sustainable}} energy policy are driving the deployment of wind and solar energy towards the goal of reducing fossil fuel emissions. In liberalized (deregulated) markets, the large-scale deployment of wind or solar energy results in electricity price collapse at times of high wind or solar output to below the price of fossil fuels. This revenue collapse limits economic large-scale use of wind and solar and reduces the revenue for nuclear plants. The current electrical energy storage options are too expensive to be deployed in sufficient quantity to prevent the price collapse. A less expensive approach to energy storage is required to enable a low carbon-energy grid. This thesis explores the potential of a new energy storage technology to address the challenges of a low-carbon energy grid: FIrebrick Resistance-heated Energy Storage (FIRES). FIRES is a storage technology that takes in surplus electricity, stores the energy as high temperature sensible heat (1200 °C- 1700 °C) in a firebrick storage medium, and outputs the stored heat as hot air when the energy is desired. The stream of hot air {{can be used to}} (1) provide <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> temperature industries in place of natural gas, or (2) be added to a power cycle to produce electricity when it is in demand. FIRES heat storage is nearly two orders of magnitude less expensive than the current energy storage options (on the order of dollars per kilowatt-hour capital cost). Cheap electricity transferred to the heating market by FIRES reduces heating costs and carbon emissions by offering industries cheaper energy than that of the competing fossil fuel, while ensuring revenue to the solar, wind and nuclear power plants. FIRES has "unlimited" storage capacity. If the firebrick is fully charged, FIRES electric resistance heaters will provide hot air to furnaces as long as electric prices are less than fossil-fuel prices. In the long term, FIRES stored heat may be used for peak electricity production in advanced nuclear plants with air-Brayton power cycles, with roundtrip storage efficiencies (electricity-to-heat-to-electricity) near 70 %, in class with that of existing electrical energy storage options. Conceptual designs of FIRES heat storage on the megawatt-hour scale were found to be chargeable and dischargeable over periods of several hours or several days as needed. FIRES technology is ready for applications under 1200 °C using existing technologies; research is required for higher temperature and high pressure (Brayton power cycle) applications. The applications, conceptual designs, system modeling and preliminary performance and economic evaluations are detailed in the following study. by Daniel Christopher Stack. Thesis: S.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study the meridional heat {{transport}} {{of the climate}} system and its partition between the atmosphere and oceans using models and data. I focus on three primary questions: (1) What is the total heat transport and its partition between the two fluids? (2) What sets {{the magnitude of the}} total heat transport and to what extent is it sensitive to the details of atmospheric and oceanic circulation? (3) How robust is the partition of heat transport between the two fluids and how sensitive is it to bathymetric constraints on ocean circulation? For these studies I employ a series of aqua-planet calculations using a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model in which idealized ocean basins impose various geometrical constraints on ocean circulation. A wide range of ocean heat transports and heat transport partitions are found, but with more modest variations in the total heat transport. Differences in the total heat transport are associated with {{the presence or absence of}} polar ice which is found to be sensitive to the ability of the ocean to carry <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> latitudes. These model results, as well as data, are analyzed in the context of earlier work suggesting that the total meridional heat transport should be insensitive to the details of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The heat transport partitions in these aqua-planet calculations are also analyzed. The calculations all feature the same gross partition as the present climate with the ocean dominating near the equator and the atmosphere dominating at middle and high latitudes. While this suggests that this overall partition may be a robust feature of the climate system, there are important differences associated with the presence or absence of a meridional barrier to zonal flow in the ocean. (cont.) These results are diagnosed in the context of simple models and scalings which compare the strength of the atmospheric and oceanic circulations and the energy contrasts across the flows. Parallels are drawn with present and paleo climate. Finally, I produce a new estimate of the total meridional heat transport employing the method of minimum variance estimation, data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System instruments, and a prior estimate. This new estimate yields a peak poleward heat transport of 5. 6 ± 0. 8 PW at 35 °N and 35 °S with a northward transport of 0. 1 ± 0. 9 PW at the equator. This represents a 27 % reduction in the standard error relative to the prior estimate. An estimate of the partition is made using direct ocean heat transport estimates with the atmospheric component computed as a residual. by Daniel Enderton. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 24, 2014 - Sept. 24, 2014 The three studies that comprise this dissertation seek to answer significant questions in paleoclimatology through unconventional applications of ice core greenhouse gas data. These studies involve different gases and span the interval of time between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Industrial Revolution, but are united by their nontraditional use of greenhouse gases and their attempt to realize the potential for greenhouse gases to reveal important information about Earth’s climate. Ever since their discovery, the abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events have proved challenging to explain. The dominant hypothesis involves periodic freshwater discharges into the North Atlantic, which may regulate {{the strength of the}} Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and its role in transporting <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> latitudes. These events were not {{restricted to}} the North Atlantic, and can also be recognized in paleoclimate archives around the world. However, numerous uncertainties surrounding the mechanism behind D-O events remain, including how they are communicated to low latitudes and whether other hypotheses can be definitively ruled out. To constrain the mechanism behind abrupt climate changes, we investigate the phasing of climate changes in high- and low-latitude regions at the Bølling Transition, the penultimate abrupt warming event of the last glacial period. We use methane and the ¹⁵N/¹⁴N ratio of N₂ from the North Greenland Eemian (NEEM) ice core, which serve as proxies for tropical climate and Greenland temperature, respectively. We find that these gases change synchronously in the ice core record, and use a firn air model together with a Monte Carlo approach to constrain the phase lag to within several decades. Our results indicate that the mechanism behind the Bølling Transition was capable of rapidly transmitting the climate signal across the planet in a matter of years, and must therefore involve components of the climate system that are suitably reactive. The glacial-interglacial change in atmospheric methane concentrations revealed in ice core records has spurred a decade of debate about its cause. The most likely explanations involve dramatic changes in methane emissions, which originate from both high- and low-latitude wetlands. One method of investigating the changing latitudinal distribution of methane sources is to quantify the difference in methane concentrations between Greenland and Antarctica, which changes in proportion to the fraction of methane produced at high northern latitudes. Previous attempts to determine the methane interpolar difference (IPD) abound, but many have been hampered by complications in synchronizing bipolar ice core records and analytical uncertainties. We present the first continuous estimate of the methane IPD across the termination using high-resolution methane data from the NEEM and West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice cores. Our results reveal the dominant role of tropical sources in driving abrupt changes in atmospheric methane concentrations, and show that boreal methane sources were surprisingly insensitive to dramatic climate changes. We hypothesize that changes in Northern Hemisphere snow and ice cover exerted strong control over tropical methane emissions, while gradually increasing solar insolation and land area allowed boreal sources to grow during the termination. We also investigate the IPD across the major climate transitions of the termination, and during four centennial-scale methane variations, and find opposing trends in boreal and tropical source strengths during these transient events. We propose that temporary decoupling of the locus of interhemispheric mixing, the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and tropical precipitation may explain these results.
