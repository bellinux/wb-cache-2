25|$|The Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (<b>DICOM)</b> Standard is used {{globally}} to store, exchange, {{and transmit}} medical images. The <b>DICOM</b> Standard incorporates protocols for imaging {{techniques such as}} radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, and radiation therapy. <b>DICOM</b> includes standards for image exchange (e.g., via portable media such as DVDs), image compression, 3-D visualization, image presentation, and results reporting.|$|E
2500|$|Medical imaging {{techniques}} produce very {{large amounts of}} data, especially from CT, MRI and PET modalities. [...] As a result, storage and communications of electronic image data are prohibitive {{without the use of}} compression. [...] JPEG 2000 is the state-of-the-art image compression <b>DICOM</b> standard for storage and transmission of medical images. [...] The cost and feasibility of accessing large image data sets over low or various bandwidths are further addressed by use of another <b>DICOM</b> standard, called JPIP, to enable efficient streaming of the JPEG 2000 compressed image data.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D {{images are}} {{calculated}} from {{a set of}} projections acquired during a rotation of the C-Arm around the patient. The volume reconstruction is performed on a separate workstation. The C-Arm and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the C-arm to exactly the same perspective for fluoroscopy. In the same way, if the C-arm angulation is changed, this angulation can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the fluoroscopic view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other <b>DICOM</b> images, such as CT or MRT data acquired preoperatively.|$|E
5000|$|<b>DICOM</b> {{and other}} file formats: <b>DICOM</b> is {{supported}} via an import step that automatically recognizes series of 2D <b>DICOM</b> frames {{that belong to}} the same 3D/4D image volume. The data can be browsed with a configurable <b>DICOM</b> browser. <b>DICOM</b> storage to PACS is possible. Other supported file formats include TIFF (2D/3D, RGBA), Analyze, RAW, PNG, JPG, BMP, and more.|$|E

5000|$|As part of <b>DICOM</b> Supplement 118 - Application Hosting, {{finalized}} in 2010, an XML [...] "native <b>DICOM</b> model" [...] {{was introduced}} that defined bi-directional transcoding of <b>DICOM</b> datasets between the conventional binary representation and an XML representation.|$|E

50|$|<b>DICOM</b> is used {{worldwide}} to store, exchange, {{and transmit}} medical images. <b>DICOM</b> has {{been central to}} the development of modernradiological imaging: <b>DICOM</b> incorporates standards for imaging modalities such as radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radiation therapy. <b>DICOM</b> includes protocols for image exchange (e.g., via portable media such as DVDs), image compression, 3-D visualization, image presentation, and results reporting.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Web Access to <b>DICOM</b> Persistent Objects (WADO) {{standard was}} {{a joint effort}} by <b>DICOM</b> and an ISO working group [...] and was released in 2003 as <b>DICOM</b> Supplement 85 and ISO 17432. The word [...] "persistent" [...] in the name was later dropped. The ISO standard has not been maintained as <b>DICOM</b> PS3.18 has evolved over time. The suffix [...] "-URI" [...] was later added to distinguish {{what is now called}} WADO-URI from the newer services. WADO-URI became popular for providing access to both original <b>DICOM</b> files and server side rendered versions of them, and accordingly was included in the IHE XDS-I.b profile as one of its required transport mechanisms, ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>DICOM</b> {{describes}} {{many different}} [...] "Information Object Definitions" [...] and [...] "SOP Classes" [...] for storage of images with specific metadata related to particular modalities and applications, {{and the list}} of these grows as technology evolves. Since the <b>DICOM</b> format is inherently extensible, and all new objects build upon a common encoding and pattern, a VNAs {{should be able to}} store any <b>DICOM</b> image object, regardless of whether the SOP Class is recognized or new. This may be achieved through the use of field-modifiable configuration to add new SOP Classes, or by analysis of the contents of the objects [...] "header", or by the simple of approach of accepting, storing and regurgitating anything transferred via a <b>DICOM</b> C-STORE operation.|$|E

5000|$|VNAs {{should have}} no {{difficulty}} storing <b>DICOM</b> content such images and associated information such as presentation states and so-called [...] "evidence documents", such as <b>DICOM</b> Structured Reports containing such things as measurements recorded by the modality, or post-processing results such as from CAD.|$|E
50|$|Grassroots <b>DICOM</b> or GDCM (originally called GNU DiCoM; {{the name}} was changed at a request for {{integration}} in ITK, followed by a change in license), is a cross-platform library written in C++ for <b>DICOM</b> medical files. It is automatically wrapped to Python/C#/Java & PHP (using SWIG). It supports RAW, JPEG (lossy/lossless), J2K, JPEG-LS, RLE and deflated. It also comes with <b>DICOM</b> Part 3,6 & 7 of the standard as XML files. It {{can be used to}} build a JPIP or WADO server.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{types of}} non-DICOM content, {{such as an}} HL7 CDA {{document}} instance containing, for example, a radiology report, could be stored either as a XDS, or first encapsulated in a <b>DICOM</b> Encapsulated CDA object and stored using <b>DICOM</b> services, or its content and header could be transcoded into a <b>DICOM</b> Structured Report instance. A fully featured VNA might {{have the ability to}} transcode any single instance into another form depending on what the requesting system needed ("object morphing", if you will).|$|E
50|$|Most {{would agree}} that an {{important}} VNA interface is the original version of Web Access to <b>DICOM</b> Persistent Objects (WADO), which allows single images to be retrieved with an HTTP URL in either <b>DICOM</b> file format or pre-rendered into a consumer format like JPEG.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{clinical}} setting, however, other document and bulk object types {{may be available}} {{that it would be}} desirable to store. Most PACS take the approach of converting these to <b>DICOM,</b> in some cases using objects intended to [...] "encapsulate" [...] another type of object. The classic example is a scanned document stored as a PDF file and encapsulated in a <b>DICOM</b> PDF object along with sufficient metadata to identify it and manage it, {{as if it were an}} image. VNAs should support these type of encapsulated <b>DICOM</b> objects and the <b>DICOM</b> [...] "header" [...] provides a means to obtain the metadata for indexing to support query and retrieval. Michael Gray elaborates in detail on this topic in his white paper on the subject.|$|E
