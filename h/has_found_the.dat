5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> {{members of a}} pod maintained {{contact with each other}} through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E

Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable.

5|$|Percy tells Annabeth {{about his}} dreams, and she deduces that Grover <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> Golden Fleece, which can cure Thalia's {{poisoned}} tree, and {{is located at}} the coordinates from the Gray Sisters. Tantalus (who replaced Chiron as camp counselor) sends Clarisse La Rue on a quest to find the Golden Fleece. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson run away from camp to find Grover. They are aided in their escape by the god Hermes, who helps them reach a passing cruise ship, the Princess Andromeda. Once aboard, they discover that the ship is full of tourists in a dream-like state living alongside Greek monsters. They are captured by Luke Castellan and learn that he is trying to revive his master Kronos. They escape on a lifeboat and eventually find one of many hideouts that Luke, Thalia, and Annabeth built as children. They are attacked by a hydra but are saved by Clarisse, who is sailing on a confederate ironclad called the CSS Birmingham.|$|E

5|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} found to be sufficiently out of equilibrium as to require further investigation. Analysis of data from the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it is present in the Venusian atmosphere. However, the planet's volcanism could explain the presence of carbonyl sulfide. In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.|$|E

5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>the</b> other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury.
