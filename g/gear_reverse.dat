He {{drives a}} car that has only one <b>gear,</b> <b>reverse.</b> He is {{struggling}} trying to make it at a local comedy club called Dukie's. Finally, he is having an affair with the owner's wife in an attempt to get more attention at the club.|$|E
50|$|In most cockpit setups, {{reverse thrust}} is set when the thrust levers are on idle by pulling them further back. Reverse thrust is {{typically}} applied immediately after touchdown, often along with spoilers, to improve deceleration {{early in the}} landing roll when residual aerodynamic lift and high speed limit {{the effectiveness of the}} brakes located on the landing <b>gear.</b> <b>Reverse</b> thrust is always selected manually, either using levers attached to the thrust levers or moving the thrust levers into a reverse thrust 'gate'.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{electrical}} {{gear shift}} mechanism sold on new automobiles was the Vulcan electric gear shift system, a solenoid-driven transmission shift device for a standard sliding gear gearbox {{introduced in the}} summer of 1913. Among the automakers to offer the Vulcan system were the Haynes Automobile Company of Kokomo, Indiana the S.G.V. Company of Reading, Pennsylvania and the Norwalk Motor Car Company of Martinsburg, West Virginia. While the Vulcan shifter was often advertised as standard equipment on the Haynes car, a common floor shift was also available for $200 less. Norwalk made the Vulcan system available on their products, such as the Underslung Six, as an option; approximately 25 of those cars were so equipped. A large nickel-plated box was attached to {{the right side of the}} steering column which housed the push button mechanism. It utilized six buttons - first through third <b>gear,</b> <b>reverse,</b> neutral and park. There was also a [...] "signal" [...] button which was the horn. A housing containing four large solenoids was mounted at the transmission which acted on the steel transmission shift control rods. The driver was free to select any gear at will, enabling the bypassing of gears, such as jumping from first to third gear without going through second gear. There was a cautionary advisory with the car that one must use care when placing the selector into reverse, only doing so when the car was completely stopped. Pushing a button on the shift control preselected the chosen gear. The electrical circuit was closed only after the driver fully depressed the clutch pedal. This energized the appropriate transmission mounted solenoids necessary for returning the transmission to neutral and then completing engagement of the preselected gear; the driver would then release the clutch pedal to continue onwards. These seemed to have been very advanced automotive systems. The Vulcan Electric Shift Company was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was eventually bought out by Cutler-Hammer. The model year 1914 was the only year that Norwalk used this system. Only one known Norwalk Motor Car survives today, which is owned by the friends of the Norwalk Foundation, Inc. in Martinsburg. Haynes was evidently the only automaker of note to place the push-buttons in the center of the steering wheel. The Vulcan electric gear shift system probably didn't survive past the early 1920s, since nothing regarding it has been found in the automotive engineering literature past 1921, and a 1919 Haynes print ad has been found with no mention of the electric shifting system.|$|E

50|$|In 1927 Deutz {{built its}} first road tractor with compressor-less diesel engine, in Cologne, the 14 hp Deutz MTH 222 with two forward <b>gears</b> and one <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|R
50|$|Tata Novus {{is powered}} by a Cummins C8.3-300 engine thatâ€™s Bharat Stage III compliant. It comes with a fully {{synchronised}} gear box with 10 forward <b>gears</b> and 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{reciprocating}} motion in no beam supported mining machines, putting energy saving as a starting point in Coal Bed Methane (CBM) exploitation, this paper designs a completely non-circular <b>gear</b> automatic <b>reversing</b> vertical drainage machine based on the theory of non-circular gear transmission. In the field of CBM exploitation, the use of non-circular gears is an attempt at an innovation. First of all, according to the working conditions of the pump and use requirements, a scheme is established whereby the one-way rotary motion of the motor is changed into reciprocating motion so that it could drive the oil pumping rod to achieve the upper and lower mining. Secondly, this paper has designed a new type non-circular <b>gear</b> <b>reversing</b> box as the core component to replace the traditional four beam linkage mechanism and also provides elaborate calculations. Finally, the movement simulation of the non-circular <b>gear</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> system is completed. Comparing the motion simulation results with the theoretical ones, the correctness of our theoretical analysis can be verified. Compared with the traditional devices, the new coal seam gas drainage machine model design has nearly 11 % higher efficiency, which has obvious energy saving effects and reduces the cost of mining coal seam gas...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with bar frames, Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> steam-operated <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> and 11 {{in diameter}} piston valves. Since {{the proportions of}} the engine units and the wheel diameters {{were the same as}} that of the Class 19D, many of their parts were made interchangeable.|$|R
5000|$|A typical manual {{transmission}} vehicle, with (for example) five forward gears, will thus have seven possible positions: the five forwards <b>gears,</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> and a central [...] "neutral" [...] position. Some vehicles {{have a special}} button to prevent accidental engagement of reverse. Others require that the lever be lifted, pressed down, or moved with extra force to engage reverse. In transmissions with reverse directly below fifth, {{there may be a}} mechanical lock-out preventing selection of reverse other than from neutral, thus preventing a driver used to a six-speed transmission from engaging reverse while trying to select sixth.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, {{redesigned}} linkage in {{the transmission}} {{made it possible}} for the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> to be activated with the regular gear-shift. Since 1904, all Packards had had a separate lever for the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} discussion normally {{applies only}} to the forward gears. The implementation of the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> is usually different, implemented {{in the following way}} to reduce the cost of the transmission. Reverse is also a pair of gears: one gear on the countershaft and one on the output shaft. However, whereas all the forward gears are always meshed together, there is a gap between the <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> Moreover, they are both attached to their shafts: neither one rotates freely about the shaft. When reverse is selected a small gear, called an idler <b>gear</b> or <b>reverse</b> idler, is slid between them. The idler has teeth which mesh with both gears, and thus it couples these <b>gears</b> together and <b>reverses</b> the direction of rotation without changing the gear ratio.|$|R
50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate <b>gear</b> <b>reverses</b> the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the 4 in thick bar frames, while the piston valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by Walschaerts valve <b>gear.</b> <b>Reversing</b> was effected {{by means of}} a screw gear. The locomotive had a Belpaire firebox and, instead of the usual deep bridle casting, was built with a shallow casting and frame under the firebox. This permitted all firebox stays to be removed without lifting the boiler from the frame.|$|R
50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet master clutch, a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> (1x3x4). Note that the top three <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are not available for use.|$|R
50|$|All Schwimmwagen {{were four}} wheel drive only on first <b>gear</b> (and <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> with some models) and had ZF {{self-locking}} differentials on both front and rear axles. Just like the KÃ¼belwagen, the Schwimmwagen had portal gear rear hubs that gave better ground clearance, {{while at the same}} time reducing drive-line torque stresses with their gear reduction at the wheels.|$|R
50|$|They had {{an outside}} frame, the drive was {{achieved}} using a mechanical, three-stage <b>gear</b> and a <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> unit. The axles were driven by connecting rods via a jackshaft. The Treibzapfen and crank pins were located outside the frame.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{the default}} gearbox was also {{available}} with a fully usable first gear group, resulting in eight forward <b>gears</b> and four <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> The eight-speed-gearbox-lever has a single-H-layout {{with an additional}} lever for switching the groups, rather than the six-speed-H-layout.|$|R
50|$|The 4L60-E (and similar 4L65-E) is {{a series}} of {{automatic}} transmissions from General Motors. Designed for longitudinal engine configurations, the series includes 4 forward <b>gears</b> and 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> It is an evolution of the Turbo-Hydramatic 700R4, originally produced in 1982.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Midget Motors {{developed}} the Junior and Trainer. Both designs were tube-framed motorized four-wheelers that were forerunners of the go-karts and all-terrain vehicles {{that were to}} become popular later. The Junior was powered by a 2.5 hp (1.9 kW) Briggs & Stratton engine, while the Trainer used a 3 hp (2.2 kW) Briggs and Stratton. Both had an automatic clutch with a <b>geared,</b> <b>reverse</b> transmission in the drive train. They were discontinued in the early 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The Caprotti {{valve gear}} {{was driven by}} a single shaft, located between the frames, and driven from the leading coupled axle by a bevel <b>gear.</b> The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was {{operated}} by a screw wheel requiring multiple turns to go from full forward to full reverse; in this it differed from the standard Caprotti version, which only required one turn. It was designed {{to operate in the}} same way as the <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> on the Walschaerts-fitted Black Fives. However reversing between intermediate cutoff positions could only be achieved by winding to the full-gear position in the new direction and then winding back.|$|R
50|$|The Volvo I-Shift is an {{automated}} manual transmission developed by Volvo subsidiary Volvo Powertrain AB for Volvo Trucks and Volvo Buses, with 12 forward <b>gears</b> and 4 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> It became available for trucks no later than 2001 and buses no later than 2004.|$|R

50|$|Scottish marine {{engineer}} Alexander Wilson founded {{the company at}} 90-92 Wandsworth Road, Vauxhall, London, in 1857. Originally named Alex Wilson and Company, then Vauxhall Iron Works from 1897, the company built pumps and marine engines. In 1903 the company built its first car, a five-horsepower single-cylinder model steered using a tiller, with two forward <b>gears</b> and no <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> About 70 {{were made in the}} first year, before the car was improved with wheel steering and a <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> in 1904.
