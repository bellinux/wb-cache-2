30|$|Given {{that the}} <b>distributions</b> <b>and</b> {{values of the}} sparse {{coefficients}} reflect which subspace is expanded by the test frame, we can use these parameters {{to determine whether a}} monitored scene has moving content.

5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to Devonian periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{study has}} been made of the {{vertical}} <b>distributions</b> <b>and</b> migrations {{of a large number of}} zooplankton species at Weather Station "P" in the Subarctic Pacific. Simultaneously towed horizontal opening-closing nets were used for the study. The <b>distributions</b> <b>and</b> migrations of 104 taxa have been subjectively grouped into seven basic patterns. A few taxa could not be so grouped. Examination of hydrographic features reveals correlations between animal <b>distributions</b> <b>and</b> strong hydrographic gradients. It is concluded that: 1. In boreal oceanic waters, few animals perform diurnal migrations, 2. Depth ranges for most zooplankton are on the order of hundreds of meters, and 3. Hydrographic features may influence the vertical <b>distributions</b> <b>and</b> migrations of zooplankton...|$|R
