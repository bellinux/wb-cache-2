50|$|A <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> or {{guard tube}} is a tube-like piece of {{apparatus}} used to house a disposable solid desiccant, wherein {{at one end}} the tube-like structure terminates in a ground glass joint for use in connecting the <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> to a reaction vessel, {{for the purpose of}} keeping the vessel free of moisture.|$|E
50|$|The tube-like {{structure}} is often bent {{and can also}} widen to form a bulb/desiccant reservoir. Typically a <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> is 1-2 cm wide and 5-10 cm long and bent at an angle of about 90 degrees. In use, the <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> is filled with a rechargeable desiccant such as calcium chloride, and the open end of <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> is partially blocked (e.g. with wool, glasswool or a bung/cork which has a small bore made in it) and the <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> {{is connected to the}} apparatus to be kept dry via the ground glass joint. If the <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> is bent the bend is oriented so that solid desiccant does not fall into the reaction vessel. Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel. Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted. Reactions which are being heated, or which evolve gases, must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel. Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the reflux condenser, allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture.|$|E

40|$|Authors: Lucas Kinard, Kurtis Kasper & Antonios Mikos ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} drying of dichloromethane {{by a simple}} 10 step procedure. One can implement this protocol using common lab glass and lab equipment. First, dichloromethane is refluxed with calcium hydride to remove water. Then, dichloromethane is distilled to separate it from the byproducts of the reflux reaction. This procedure can be implemented in 1 day. ### Introduction In many instances in synthetic chemistry {{it may be necessary}} to remove residual water from solvents in order to carry out a synthesis procedure under inert conditions. In this example, water is removed from dichloromethane by refluxing dichloromethane in the presence of calcium hydride at 60 °C. Under these conditions, calcium hydride reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> while calcium hydroxide is separated from the anhydrous dichloromethane by distillation at 80 °C in a subsequent step. ### Reagents 1. Calcium hydride, ≥ 95 % (Sigma-Aldrich Co., cat. no. 208027 - 100 G) - Dichloromethane, ≥ 99. 5 %, ACS certified (EMD, cat. no. DX 0835 - 5) ### Equipment 1. Condenser (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1218 - 07) - Distillation adapter (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1024 - 01) - <b>Drying</b> <b>tube,</b> “U” shaped (Chemglass, cat. no. CG- 1296 - 01) - Glass thermometer (10 / 30) (Wilmad LabGlass, cat. no. LG- 10515 - 106) - Heating mantle (1000 mL) (Glas-Col, cat. no. O 408) - Insulating wool - Laboratory clamps - Large magnetic stir bars (PTFE) - Magnetic stir plate - One-necked round-bottomed flask (1 L) - One-necked round-bottomed flask (100 mL) - Rubber tubing - Three-way 120 ° angle connecting adapter (Corning, cat. no. 9021 - 24) - Transformer (Warner Electric, cat. no. 3 PN 116 C) ### Procedure - **Drying of dichloromethane TIMING ~ 3 h** 1. Add calcium hydride (20 g) and dichloromethane (700 mL) into a one-necked round-bottomed flask (1 L) and fit the round-bottomed flask with a condenser and <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> filled with drierite (Figure 1). - CAUTION Calcium hydride and dichloromethane are irritating and/or harmful if exposed to the skin or inhaled. Calcium hydride releases flammable gases upon contact with water. Conduct all work in a chemical fume hood. Proper personal protective equipment (lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety glasses) should be worn throughout the procedure. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar. - Heat the reaction flask to 60 °C using a heating mantle and reflux at 60 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, calcium hydride reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas is allowed to escape from the system through a <b>drying</b> <b>tube.</b> - After 2 h, cool the reaction flask to room temperature (20 - 25 °C). - PAUSE POINT Once cooled, the dichloromethane/calcium hydride mixture may be sealed and stored overnight in the fume hood, if necessary. - **Distillation of dichloromethane TIMING ~ 6 h** 5. Attach the flask from Step 4 to the apparatus shown in Figure 2 with a 100 mL receiving flask. - Stir the mixture using a magnetic stir bar and heat the reaction flask to 80 °C using a heating mantle. - Collect the first 30 mL distillate in the 100 mL receiving flask and then replace with a 1000 mL receiving flask. - CRITICAL STEP The first 30 mL distillate may contain residual water and should be discarded. - Continue heating until ~ 600 mL anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected in the receiving flask. - Once the desired amount of anhydrous dichloromethane has been collected, cool the reaction flask to room temperature. - Once cooled, seal the flask with the remaining mixture from step 1 and store in the fume hood awaiting either reuse of unreacted calcium hydride or disposal. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Drying of dichloromethane** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") **Figure 2 : Distillation of dichloromethane** ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") ### Associated Publications **Synthesis of oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) **.

40|$|Traditionally, the formation, {{deposition}} {{and reactions}} of molecular ions are conducted in high vacuum environment, or at least, at reduced pressure. In this thesis, molecular ions are considered as ordinary organic molecules {{and they are}} generated, transmitted and reacted with vapors or adsorbates on surfaces, all in the ordinary open environment. For example, ion soft landing was successfully implemented under ambient conditions. In ambient ion soft landing, ions generated by electrospray ionization are passed pneumatically through a heated metal <b>drying</b> <b>tube,</b> their polarity is selected using ion deflectors, and the dry selected ions are deposited onto a selected surface at a specified location. Unlike the corresponding vacuum soft-landing experiment, where ions are mass-selected and soft-landed within a mass spectrometer, here the ions to be soft-landed are selected through {{the choice of a}} compound that gives predominantly one ionic species upon ambient ionization. No mass analysis is performed during the soft landing experiment. The purified ions were typically used for surface preparation and modification. However, when utilized as reagents for organic reactions (e. g., pyrylium cation conversion into pyridinium cation) in a solvent-free environment, the ionic species provided a regioselective route to the expected reaction product when employing bifunctional reagents (e. g., D-lysine and ethanolamine) compared with the corresponding bulk solution-phase reaction conditions. ^ Charged microdroplets associated with incompletely dried ions could also be selected for surface reactions by choice of the temperature of the <b>drying</b> <b>tube</b> inserted between the ion source and the electrical ion deflectors. This reaction condition allowed at least one order of magnitude increase in reaction rate compared with the bulk solution phase reaction conducted using the same quantities of starting reagents. The droplet reaction condition was further developed in three different ways: (i) nanoelectrospray emitter array, (ii) contained-electrospray apparatus and (iii) electrospray synthetic apparatus with high efficient product collection system. These are envisioned to impact the field of synthetic chemistry at larger scales due to the dramatic reaction rate enhancements. Several reaction systems have been studied under the charged microdroplet condition including [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (e. g., Borsche-Drecsel cyclization), C-N (e. g., Girard condensation) and C-C (e. g., Claisen-Schmidt condensation) bonds formation. The droplet reaction was extended to thin film reactions which represent an alternative version of limited-volume reactors. The aza-Michael addition and the Mannich condensation were observed to occur in thin films deposited on ambient surfaces. ^ Fundamentals of ion generation in the ambient environment were also studied, particularly the mechanism of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI). Critical evidence based on studies of surfactants and non-aqueous solvents has been provided for the proposed DESI (droplet pick-up) mechanism. ...|$|E

The first is a reference method, for accurate determinations of moisture content (such as are needed to calculate emission data). The second is an approximation method, which provides estimates of percent moisture to aid in setting isokinetic sampling rates prior to a pollutant emission measurement run. The approximation method described herein is only a suggested approach; alternative means for approximating the moisture content, e. g., <b>drying</b> <b>tubes,</b> wet bulb- <b>dry</b> bulb techniques, condensation techniques, stoichiometric calculations, previous experience, etc., are also acceptable. 1. 2. 2 The reference method is often conducted simultaneously with a pollutan...|$|R
