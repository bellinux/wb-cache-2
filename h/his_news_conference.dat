40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] General Assembly {{financing}} {{for a new}} law school building during the coming biennium apparently is not crucial to the continued American Bar Association accreditation of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William and Mary. President Thomas A. Graves Jr. and an ABA representative who visited William and Mary on Wednesday both indicated that the college is considering 2 ̆ 2 interim solutions 2 ̆ 2 that could satisfy the ABA if funds are not forthcoming from the General Assembly next year. Graves disclosed three weeks ago that ABA accreditation is in jeopardy, {{largely because of the}} inadequacy of the school 2 ̆ 7 s physical plant, and underlined again Wednesday the urgency of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s request for 5. 5 million to build a law school. There have been indications from state officials, though, including State Sen. Edward E. Willey, D-Richmond, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that money will be extremely tight and that the college should consider alternatives to a new building in the coming biennium. Graves, speaking to newsmen following the visit Wednesday of ABA consultant James P. White, said the college will be considering 2 ̆ 2 between now and the end of fall semester... how best to cope with the situation if alternative plans become necessary on a temporary basis. 2 ̆ 2 He did not say what the alternatives would include. 2 ̆ 2 Looking for Solutions 2 ̆ 2 White, speaking at a news conference after a morning in which he met with Graves; George R. Healy, vice president for academic affairs, and acting law school dean Emeric Fischer, said 2 ̆ 2 the college has indicated that they are looking at some interim solutions... 2 ̆ 2 If the funds do not come through next year, White said, 2 ̆ 2 we would hope that there is some sort of interim solution devised by the state and by the college that would satisfy our concerns. 2 ̆ 2 White stressed once again the inadequacy of the law school 2 ̆ 7 s physical plant and library, saying that it is 2 ̆ 2 in no way in compliance with our standards. 2 ̆ 2 After talks with college officials on his third visit this year, White said it is 2 ̆ 2 unlikely 2 ̆ 2 the ABA accreditation committee will recommend loss of accreditation. 2 ̆ 2 I think that both the college and the state are responding in good faith, given the financial exigencies that exist, and I would hope that some solution could be devised to satisfy the American Bar Association, 2 ̆ 2 he said. After the two-hour morning meeting, White talked with law school faculty members and then met with a large group of Marshall-Wythe students in the moot courtroom. He said he spent the meeting with Graves discussing 2 ̆ 2 internal matters 2 ̆ 2 contained in his July 31 letter, which outlined deficiencies threatening ABA accreditation. 2 ̆ 2 I personally feel satisfied that [the college] is {{well on its way to}} correcting those concerns, 2 ̆ 2 White said. He declined to enumerate them. Admissions Policy Later, though, he said that one of the most important concerned the law school 2 ̆ 7 s admission policies. Asked what the ABA 2 ̆ 7 s concern was, he responded by reading the policy on admissions, which said, in essence, that the admission standards of an ABA-approved law school must be formulated and administered by the law school. News reports Tuesday had said that White 2 ̆ 7 s July 31 letter stressed the need for greater law school autonomy from the college 2 ̆ 7 s general admissions policy. Graves himself said Wednesday that the second internal matter discussed between him and White had been faculty promotions, although he did not elaborate on the point at issue. White stressed, in <b>his</b> <b>news</b> <b>conference,</b> that the ABA regard the Marshall-Wythe academic program, faculty, and student body as 2 ̆ 2 good, 2 ̆ 2 and that the major problem facing the school is that of physical resources...|$|E
40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] Gerald Ford, at {{the college}} of William and Mary {{yesterday}} to lecture to students, charged that the economic policies of the Carter administration 2 ̆ 2 have been a disaster. They 2 ̆ 7 ve blown it. 2 ̆ 2 Carter and his staff have 2 ̆ 2 reignited inflation by irresponsible fiscal policies, 2 ̆ 2 Ford added, noting the the prime interest rate is at a record high, inflation is running about 13 percent and unemployment is growing. For the most part, however, Ford sounded more like an elder statesman than a Republican Party presidential candidate. At a press conference, he strongly restated his position: 2 ̆ 2 I am not a candidate for any political office. I have no plans to be a candidate for any political office. 2 ̆ 2 As a politician, he said he has learned 2 ̆ 2 never say never, 2 ̆ 2 but 2 ̆ 2 the scenario is so remote that I would get involved in the 1980 campaign. 2 ̆ 2 The only scenario he even discussed involved the Republican National Convention. What if the convention were deadlocked? Would he accept a draft? 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 ve never ducked any responsibility in politics or otherwise, 2 ̆ 2 he responded. 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 d feel an obligation. 2 ̆ 2 Ford acknowledged that there has been great pressure recently on him to become a candidate. Those urging him to run include 2 ̆ 2 Democrats, Republicans, and independents. There have been phone calls, letters, contact, 2 ̆ 2 he said. 2 ̆ 2 What would change my mind? I really haven 2 ̆ 7 t written the scenario. It 2 ̆ 7 s so remote. 2 ̆ 2 Earlier this week, his wife, Betty, told reporters that he was not running. Would she oppose another White House bid? 2 ̆ 2 Betty is in the best of health, the best of our 31 years of marriage, 2 ̆ 2 Ford said. 2 ̆ 2 She traditionally has supported whatever decision I made. 2 ̆ 2 He noted, however, that she concurs with his decision not to run. Ford flew to Virginia Tuesday night from his Palm Springs, Calif. home. He was met at William and Mary yesterday morning by reporters, a few students, President Thomas A. Graves, Jr. and William B. Spong, Jr., dean of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law. He exchanged warm greetings with Spong, who served a term in the Senate while Ford was in the House of Representatives. 2 ̆ 2 Bill, how are you? 2 ̆ 2 Ford said. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s nice being here. 2 ̆ 2 His itinerary included a 20 -minute news conference and three classroom lectures, two at the law school and one in the government department. The students warmly received Ford and a large number turned out in the evening to hear a more formal address at William and Mary Hall, where he again talked about the plight of the economy. Earlier, he told students that the Federal Reserve Board {{had little choice but to}} boost its prime interest rate a full point. 2 ̆ 2 All of that could have been avoided, 2 ̆ 2 he said, if the Carter administration 2 ̆ 2 had followed the economic policies we followed. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Only Answer 2 ̆ 2 He said that during his term, the inflation rate was slowed to 4. 8 percent and the prime interest rate was brought to 6. 25 percent. 2 ̆ 2 They re-ignited inflation... and the only answer they have is to slam on the brakes, 2 ̆ 2 he added. 2 ̆ 2 When I became president we had serious economic problems. I 2 ̆ 7 m proud of our economic progress 2 ̆ 2 during his term, Ford said. He also was highly critical of Carter 2 ̆ 7 s handling of the recent Cuban affair involving the brigade of Soviet troops on the island, saying Carter 2 ̆ 7 s televised speech last week 2 ̆ 2 was not affirmative enough. 2 ̆ 2 At the outset Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance said the troops in Cuba 2 ̆ 2 were unacceptable. They both used that term, 2 ̆ 2 Ford said, 2 ̆ 2 and I think they were right. 2 ̆ 2 But Ford said that Carter 2 ̆ 7 s speech implied that the troops 2 ̆ 2 were acceptable... that inconsistency will help erode the U. S. image, 2 ̆ 2 he added. Ford said he was disappointed in the speech, and Carter 2 ̆ 7 s action establishing a command post at Key West, Fla. and increasing troop strength temporarily at Guantanamo Bay 2 ̆ 2 was just window dressing. 2 ̆ 2 The former president denied a charge by Prime Minister Fidel Castro that Ford knew about the troops. No Indication At no time during my presidency did the intelligence community send to the White House or to Henry Kissinger 2 ̆ 2 any indication there were Soviet combat troops there. Carter 2 ̆ 7 s mishandling of the problem, Ford said, resulted in the 2 ̆ 2 first time an American president has been stonewalled by the Soviet Union and has not responded... and it is the first time the United States has accepted hostile foreign troops in the Western Hemisphere. 2 ̆ 2 He criticized the 2 ̆ 2 open way 2 ̆ 2 the Carter administration approached Moscow. A quiet approach would have been better, he said, adding that Carter could have placed sanctions on the Soviet Union such as eliminating scientific exchanges or certain purchases. 2 ̆ 2 The Soviets understand things like that and they would have recognized it, 2 ̆ 2 Ford explained. Foreign Policy Several times during the day, at the news conference and in the classrooms Ford emphasized that foreign policy should be left to the president and the secretary of state. Regarding the recent Middle East visit by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Ford said: 2 ̆ 2 Every American citizen has the right to travel overseas. No American citizen has the right to undertake foreign policy decision making. 2 ̆ 2 Ford lunched at Alumni House with Spong and student leaders of the law school. The law school 2 ̆ 7 s student legal forum was one of the prime movers to get Ford on campus. Also yesterday, Ford returned to Phi Beta Kappa Hall, the scene of his Oct. 22, 1976 campaign debate with Jimmy Carter. In the lobby, he dedicated a small tablet, presented to the college by the Society of the Alumni, noting the site of the debate. Last night Ford attended a brief reception at the president 2 ̆ 7 s house and then had dinner with about 50 guests in the Great Hall of the Wren Building where <b>his</b> <b>news</b> <b>conference</b> was held...|$|E
