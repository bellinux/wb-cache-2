500|$|The second-leg draw meant Liverpool won the tie, 4–3 on aggregate, to {{win their}} second UEFA Cup after their first victory in 1973. They also {{completed}} a League and UEFA Cup double for a second time. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was delighted with players after their performance in the second leg: [...] "The second half was the longest 45 minutes of my life. There was {{an awful lot of}} pride in this game because we came representing England. We did not let the country <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are proud of our lads." ...|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E

2500|$|On August 14, 2007, Stephen Harper shuffled MacKay from Foreign Affairs to Defence, {{replacing}} Gordon O'Connor. On November 6, 2007, {{while attending}} {{a meeting at}} Forward Operating Base Wilson, 20 kilometres west of Kandahar City, Mackay was unharmed as two rockets struck the base at about 11 a.m. local time. Mackay described the incident: [...] "There was an explosion. It was a loud bang", said MacKay. [...] "When it happened, we heard the explosion, we heard the whistle overhead, {{we were told to}} get <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> did." [...] The incident happened {{on the same day that}} a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 35 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.|$|E
2500|$|Even 1968's [...] "Aerial View No. 1", {{despite the}} spatial {{hint of the}} title, is far from literal. Certain {{features}} of structure and color render a literal interpretation of this image as an aerial landscape difficult or even impossible. The attempt at interpretation is both invited and repulsed. But by about 1970, with the [...] "Night Landings" [...] paintings, there was a definite shift away from the previous decade's stubbornly refractive attitude. The [...] "Night Landings" [...] offer a much more definite sense of scale and viewpoint, especially {{with the aid of}} the titles. [...] "Night Landings: Nairobi" [...] is not disorienting in the least: we know where we are; we know we're in a plane, we know the plane is landing, and we even know roughly what time it is: we are looking <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> see vividly the city named in the title, with the surrounding land and water.|$|E
2500|$|To {{define the}} natural product of two ordinals, {{consider}} {{once again the}} cartesian product S × T of two well-ordered sets having these order types. [...] Start by putting a partial order on this cartesian product by using just the product order (compare two pairs {{if and only if}} each of the two coordinates is comparable). [...] Now consider the order types of all well-orders on S × T which extend this partial order: the least upper bound of all these ordinals (which is, actually, not merely a least upper bound but actually a greatest element) is the natural product. [...] There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> shall not do so (see the article on surreal numbers for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals).|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
