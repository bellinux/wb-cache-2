Dr. Foster was also responsible for establishing the Lake Charm area as a resort to entice visitors from the North to vacation in the winter. Dr. Foster encouraged settlers to begin attending regular church services on a site of the [...] "Powell Settlement" [...] that would become the First Methodist Church of Oviedo.|$|E
50|$|In 1849, the {{development}} of the area was slow until <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster</b> came {{looking for a place to}} begin his water cure. The field of medicine was just beginning and it was thought that the sulphur waters together with a strong religious revival could restore many to active and useful lives. Sulphur Springs, as it was once called, was well known throughout the eastern part of the US because of this. Over the years, thousands of people came to enjoy the benefits of the water and rest and regain their health. Some famous people who visited the area was Elvis Presley, and Betty Davis' daughter. The area around the former sanitarium was designated the Clifton Springs Sanitarium Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.|$|E

50|$|Clifton Springs Sanitarium is a {{historic}} sanitarium building located at Clifton Springs in Ontario County, New York. Construction of the sanitarium building began in 1892 as a five-story ell-shaped 244 ft brick structure in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The facade is eleven bays wide and terminated at each end by a conical tower with flat roof. A rectangular tower dominates the central bay. The building includes a chapel that has a favrile glass mosaic of the Last Supper designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It was home to the Clifton Springs Water Cure promoted by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster,</b> whose 1854 home, Foster Cottage, {{is located on the}} property. In 1974 it was converted to a senior citizens apartment building. The sanitarium building and Foster Cottage were later included as part of the Clifton Springs Sanitarium Historic District.|$|E
50|$|Mead {{had first}} visited Florida in 1869 on a {{butterfly}} collecting trip, {{where he had}} successfully captured his rarest specimen near Enterprise - a female of Papilio calverleyi; only one other specimen of that type had ever been found before. He considered the climate there ideal for the growing of semi-tropical plants, so after marriage he moved to Eustis, Florida where his father had bought him an orange grove and land to develop and grow other plants. Income would come from citrus and the growing of other cash crops such as pineapples, leaving time for his experiments in horticulture.In 1886, he purchased eighty-five acres in Oviedo, Florida, close to Lake Charm where orange grove land was more fertile, choosing a location next to Edith’s aunt Mary.

50|$|<b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster</b> {{served as}} U.S. President Bill Clinton’s senior advisor on teen {{pregnancy}} reduction and youth issues, {{and was a}} nominee to the post of Surgeon General of the United States by Clinton in 1995. Foster, an obstetrician from Tennessee, was nominated {{to fill the void}} left by Jocelyn Elders, but garnered substantial controversy when he admitted that he had performed abortions. Although there were questions raised concerning his involvement with forced sterilizations during the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, Dr. Foster has sharply denied involvement although employed by the university during the final period of the experiments. When asked how many abortions he had performed, he initially replied that it had been few, but later stated the number was likely substantially higher. Opponents accused him of dishonesty, while he defended himself by stating that he could not make a spur of the moment specific recollection without examining his records. Foster faced significant opposition in the Senate, mostly by pro-life Republicans. Foster's nomination was withdrawn on June 22, following a fillibuster by Senator Phil Gramm, who was seeking the 1996 Republican presidential nomination at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Jeffords {{consistently}} {{voted against}} the ban on partial-birth abortion, and also against a harsher line on Cuba. In 1995, Jeffords {{was one of two}} Republican Senators, the other being Bill Frist of Tennessee, to vote in favor of confirming <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Foster</b> as Surgeon General http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-04/news/mn-62374_1_surgeon-general-nominee; the vote failed, and Foster's confirmation was ultimately denied. In 1995 he was one of only 16 Senators to vote against the Communications Decency Act. The Supreme Court later struck it down as unconstitutional. Jeffords highly advocated LGBT rights in the workplace. He sponsored The Employee Non Discrimination Act of 1995 (104th Congress), 1997 (105th Congress), and 1999 (106th Congress). Jeffords' non-discrimination bills did not include [...] "gender identity." [...] He was in the minority of Republicans to oppose the Flag Desecration Amendment. On guns his record was mixed, despite voting for the Brady Bill and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, he voted with gun control opponents against background checks at gun shows in 1999 and he voted with the majority of Congress for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. He took a more moderate line on the death penalty. On many economic issues Jeffords was roughly in line with the majority of the Republican Party, before and after his switch: he mostly supported free-trade agreements, voted for making enforcement of consumer protection laws more difficult by moving many class-action lawsuits into federal courts, tighter bankruptcy rules and a balanced budget amendment. Even after becoming an independent, he did vote with Republicans on many major pieces of legislation. For example, Jeffords did vote against the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, a bill supported strongly by Republican John McCain and many moderate Republicans like Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter and Mike DeWine. Two years later he voted for the prescription drug bill, derided by many Democrats as a give away to drug companies and opposed by many conservative Republicans who opposed further federal spending, but ultimately strongly supported by President George W. Bush, {{and the vast majority of}} the Republican Party.|$|E
