After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E

5|$|In the 1968 season, Wilhelm was <b>getting</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> {{breaking}} the all-time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young (906 games).

Wilhelm later broke the record as a relief pitcher. He also set MLB records for consecutive errorless games by a pitcher, career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief. Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67–95 record.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} eight days, seven additional attacks were ordered. The Algerians had placed {{a line of}} barges armed with artillery that largely prevented the Allied gunboats <b>getting</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> their objectives. A shot fired from the fortifications hit the felucca from which Barceló were directing the bombing, sinking it. José Lorenzo de Goicoechea came {{to the aid of}} the admiral, who was rescued unscathed. Passing immediately to another boat, Barceló continued leading the attack, downplaying the importance of the incident. Finally, on 21 July, it was decided to end the attack. Contrary winds forced Barceló to give the order to return to Cartagena. More than 20,000 cannonballs and grenades had been fired on the enemy, causing severe damage to the fortifications and the city, and sinking or destroying most of the Algerian vessels. The Allied casualties were 53 men killed and 64 wounded, most of them due to accidents.|$|E

25|$|Before dawn {{at around}} 6:30 a.m. on May 1, 2015, an armed convoy from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a {{criminal}} {{group based in}} Jalisco, made their way from Casimiro Castillo to Villa Purificación through several dirt roads. The vehicles drove with their headlights off to avoid the attention of Mexican Air Force and the Federal Police (PF), who were doing an air surveillance of the area in four helicopters. One of the vehicles was equipped with rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. As the helicopters flew over the convoy, the CJNG units opened fire at them from the ground. One of the helicopters, a Cougar EC725 carrying eighteen passengers, was hit on its tail and shot down with a Russian-made RPG-27 rocket launcher. Once hit, the helicopter spun {{several times in the}} air as it tried to maneuver its way back into trajectory. It then fell at a distance from where it was struck and exploded. The helicopter was shot six times and was hit twice; the gunmen tried shooting down another helicopter, but they were unable to strike it with their RPG launchers. The CJNG gunmen then made their way to where the helicopter crashed and attempted to execute any remaining living passengers. However, military reinforcements in the air prevented the criminal group from <b>getting</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the collision scene and forced them to retreat. Nine passengers were killed {{as a result of the}} airstrike: eight from the Mexican Army and one from the PF. Some of the soldiers killed were part of the Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales, the elite and special forces unit of the Army. The other passengers were taken to the Regional Military Hospitals in Guadalajara to receive medical attention. Their health conditions were not made public.|$|E
