In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him. In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah [...] "got villainized" [...] over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage {{made it difficult to}} find producers for her second album. [...] "We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to get producers on the album."

Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

This was really <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us...</b> It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic.

The book educates the reader about the [...] "Cashflow Quadrant" [...] theory, classifying individuals into categories of investor, self-employed, business owner, or employee. The authors explain {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each category.

2500|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, {{president}} of the Union for Reform Judaism, called J Street's reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza [...] "morally deficient, profoundly {{out of touch with}} Jewish sentiment and also appallingly naïve". J Street responded stating, [...] "It is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to understand how the leading reform rabbi in North America could call our effort to articulate a nuanced view on these difficult issues 'morally deficient'. If our views are 'naive' and 'morally deficient', then so are the views of scores of Israeli journalists, security analysts, distinguished authors, and retired IDF officers who have posed the same questions about the Gaza attack as we have." [...] Despite this rebuttal, J Street subsequently invited Yoffie to its 2009 convention, and he subsequently praised the organization's stance on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, which was closer to that of other American Jewish organizations.|$|E

2500|$|The Sandinistas' {{relationship}} with the Roman Catholic Church deteriorated as the Contra War continued. The hierarchy refused {{to speak out against}} the counterrevolutionary activities of the contras and failed to denounce American military aid.

According to former President Ortega, [...] "The conflict with the church was strong, and it costs us, but I don't think it was our fault. ... There were so many people being wounded every day, so many people dying, and it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to understand the position of the church hierarchy in refusing to condemn the contras." [...] The hierarchy-state tensions were brought to the fore with Pope John Paul II 1983 visit to Nicaragua. Hostility to the Catholic Church became so great that at one point, FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II as he tried to say Mass. Therefore, while the activities of the Catholic church contributed {{to the success of the}} Sandinista revolution, the hierarchy's opposition was a major factor in the downfall of the revolutionary government.|$|E
