In 1903, writing to Brema of her original performance, Elgar wrote 'I have, of course, in memory your fine and <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation</b> of the part; and though I never thought the 'tessitura' suited you well, as the magnificent artist you are, you made it go very finely.' ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly we do not, in this place, {{pretend to}} attempt it: {{we have no}} {{finished}} portrait of his character to offer, no formal estimate of his works. It will be enough for us if, in glancing over his life, we can satisfy a simple curiosity, about the fortunes and chief peculiarities of a man connected with us by a bond so kindly {{as that of the}} teacher to the taught, the giver to the receiver of mental delight; if, in wandering through his <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation,</b> we can enjoy once more the magnificent and fragrant beauty of that fairy land, and express our feelings, where we do not aim at judging and deciding.|$|E
6000|$|However, let us leave what {{is really}} a very sordid side of the subject, {{and return to the}} {{question}} of popular control in the matter of Art, by which I mean Public Opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is to use it, and the materials with which he is to work. I have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England are the arts in which the public have not been interested. They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years, it is {{important to point out that}} this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a mere matter of demand and supply. With his marvellous and vivid personality, with a style that has really a true colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation,</b> Mr Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted, could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner, and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire. But his object was not that. His object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art. At first he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many. He has created in the public both taste and temperament. The public appreciate his artistic success immensely. I often wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success is entirely due to the fact that he did not accept their standard, but realised his own. With their standard the Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of the popular theatres in London are at present. Whether they understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public, and that the public is capable of developing these qualities. The problem then is, why do not the public become more civilised? They have the capacity. What stops them? ...|$|E

50|$|The 1970s were a dark {{period for}} <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation</b> in Argentina. The epoch is characterised by the exile (Juan Gelman, Antonio Di Benedetto) or death (Roberto Santoro, Haroldo Conti, and Rodolfo Walsh) of major writers. The {{remaining}} literary journalists, like Liliana Heker, veiled their opinions in their work.

50|$|The {{copyright}} to {{an artistic}} work is typically held by its author. In {{cases where the}} artistic work was created by an animal, intellectual property analysts Mary M.

In these cases, the animal's work was not an <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation</b> of the humans, and copyrights can only be held by legal persons—which an animal is not.|$|E

5000|$|Generally speaking, {{protection}} for intellectual property extends to <b>intellectual</b> <b>creations</b> {{in order to}} incentivize innovation, and depends upon {{the nature of the}} work and its [...] "characteristics". The main types of intellectual property law are: copyright, which protects creative works; patent, which protects invention; trade secret, which protects information not generally known or readily ascertainable that is valuable to the secret holder; and trademark, which protects branding and other exclusive properties of products and services. Any matter that meets such criteria is protected.|$|R
2500|$|The concept's origins can {{potentially}} {{be traced back}} further. Jewish law includes several considerations whose effects {{are similar to those}} of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of <b>intellectual</b> <b>creations</b> as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century. In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent [...] "to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury".|$|R
5000|$|This case {{highlights}} {{the problems of}} copyright infringement and new technology in new business models, especially those involving content aggregation.This decision is considered {{to have had a}} high impact on fundamental principles of copyright law, in concluding that the European standard of originality (the author's own <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation)</b> applies not only in the limited contexts to which it has been applied in legislation such as software, photographs and databases; but to all Berne Convention [...] "works" [...] under the European acquis. This ruling is a striking example of judicial activism in the interests of harmonisation.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{property}} takes a {{range of}} forms, these include patents for inventions, industrial designs (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), trademarks, service marks, layout-designs of integrated circuits, commercial names and designations, geographical indications and protection against unfair competition. In some cases, aspects of an <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation,</b> although present, are less clearly defined. What counts then is that the object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.|$|E

50|$|The Memphite {{version of}} {{creation}} centered on Ptah, {{who was the}} patron god of craftsmen.

This, unlike the other Egyptian creations, was not a physical but an <b>intellectual</b> <b>creation</b> by the Word and the Mind of God. The ideas developed within Ptah's heart (regarded by the Egyptians as the seat of human thought) were given form when he named them with his tongue. By speaking these names, Ptah produced the gods and all other things.|$|E
