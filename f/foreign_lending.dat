While <b>foreign</b> banks'' <b>lending</b> growth to most emerging market regions contracted sharply, lending to Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) was significantly more resilient. Analyzing detailed BIS data on global banks'' lending to LAC countries-whether extended directly by their headquarters abroad or by their local affiliates in host countries-we show that the propagation of the global credit crunch was significantly more muted in countries where most of <b>foreign</b> banks'' <b>lending</b> was channeled in domestic currency. We also show that foreign banks'' involvement in LAC has differed in fundamental ways from that in other regions, with most of their lending to LAC conducted by their local subsidiaries, denominated in domestic currency and funded from a domestic deposit base. These characteristics help explain why LAC has not been struck as hard as other emerging markets by the global deleveraging and pullback in <b>foreign</b> banks'' <b>lending.</b> Banks;Bank credit;Credit restraint;Economic models;Emerging markets;International banking;Latin America;Liquidity;foreign banks, foreign bank, international settlements, foreign currency, foreign affiliates, host countries, host country, foreign competition, foreign currencies, financial stability, financial sector, <b>foreign</b> capital, international <b>lending,</b> medium-sized firms, financial services, macroeconomic stability, increased competition, financial institutions, enhanced competition, foreign operations, domestic banks, credit markets...|$|R

The results support the hypothesis that because of potential agency conflicts between shareholders and creditors, having block institutional shareholders tend to increase the borrowers 2 ̆ 7 debt burden.

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{worldwide}} crises was {{the stock market crash}} on Wall Street in October 1929. The failure from 1929-33 was foreshadowed by collapses in commodity prices in multiple emerging nations. The stock market boom in New York by 1928 choked off U.S. capital flows to central Europe and Latin America and precipitated currency crises in a number of countries (Australia, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil) and early in 1929. The Wall Street crash caused stock market scares globally. This is known as the Great Depression. The U.S. crisis in 1929 turned into the Great Depression by 1930 and 1931 because the Federal Reserve was unsuccessful at relieving multiple banking panics. The resultant collapse in prices and output worldwide forced sovereign borrowers to cut back on servicing their debts and then to default, precipitating a collapse of <b>foreign</b> <b>lending</b> in 1931.|$|E

The Chicago Boys had expected that since the government had achieved a fiscal surplus and the decision for external borrowing was left to private agents a foreign exchange crises would not occur. But {{in an effort to}} fight inflation Dollarization was introduced which lead to a Peso revaluation that caused high current account deficits which led to an increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>lending.</b> Additionally capital controls were abandoned and the financial market deregulated which led to an undamped increase in private foreign borrowing.

40|$|On June 16 2009, in what {{authorities}} called ``a surprise development'' the Turkish Government {{removed a}} provision from its existing laws that had allowed Turkish residents to borrow in foreign currency from banks operating in Turkey.

It is sensitive to the interest rate differential, exchange rate developments, funding availability, and to some extent international trade. Lending in other currencies is more used in lending to resident nonfinancial firms, and mostly in cross-border lending, where it is sensitive to funding costs and trade.

40|$|Most Central, Eastern and Southeastern European (CESEE) {{countries}} saw {{a substantial}} rise in <b>foreign</b> currency <b>lending</b> to households {{during the last}} decade.

Panel data estimates covering the period from 1996 to 2007 reveal that, on the demand side, foreign currency borrowing was attractive because interest rates for foreign currency loans were lower than those on domestic currency loans, and private sector consumption as well as housing prices were on the rise. Mitigating factors on the supply side were higher interest margins on domestic currency loans than on foreign currency loans and banking sector reforms. Regulatory measures account at least partly for the different patterns of currency structures according to descriptive evidence.

40|$|We examine foreign {{intermediation}} {{activity in}} Japan during the so-called "lost decade" of the 1990 s, contrasting {{the behavior of}} <b>lending</b> by <b>foreign</b> commercial banks and underwriting activity by foreign investment banks over that period. <b>Foreign</b> bank <b>lending</b> is shown {{to be sensitive to}} domestic Japanese conditions, particularly Japanese interest rates, more so than their domestic Japanese bank counterparts. During the 1990 s, <b>foreign</b> bank <b>lending</b> in Japan fell, both in overall numbers and as a share of total lending. However, there was marked growth in foreign underwriting activity in the international yen-denominated bond sector. A key factor in the disparity between these activities is their different clienteles: While foreign banks in Japan lent primarily to domestic borrowers, international yen-denominated bond issuers were primarily foreign entities with yen funding needs or opportunities for profitable swaps. Indeed, low interest rates that discouraged lending activity in Japan by foreign banks directly encouraged foreign underwriting activity tied to the so-called "carry trades.

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} whether <b>foreign</b> banks <b>lending</b> {{behavior}} affects Malaysian credit stability. Thus far, the concern is foreign banks could potentially withdraw from host-country economy or shrink their lending base during economic downturns, leading to an unstable credit environment. Another argument claims that <b>foreign</b> banks <b>lending</b> preferences could also lead to credit segregation between them and their technology in screening loan applications enables them {{to have the best}} borrowers among potential lenders in the sense of lower probability of default as opposed to the domestic banks. Consequently, domestic banks are left with higher risk lending portfolio. Employing traditional financial ratio analysis and standard panel data lending estimation, the findings expose {{that in the case of}} Malaysia, foreign banks are credit stabilizer in the sense that their lending cyclicality nature moderated bank lending sensitivity to economic cycles and these is no evidence to claim they contracted their lending during the recent financial crisis. The case for concern, however, lies within the fact that the evidence suggests the credit segregation hypothesis holds true.
