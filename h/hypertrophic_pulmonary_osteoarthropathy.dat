40|$|THE PARADOX that {{clubbing}} of {{the fingers}} usually occurs with <b>pulmonary</b> hyper-trophic <b>osteoarthropathy,</b> though most instances of clubbed fingers are not associated with osteo-arthropathy, should halt those physicians who have adopted the grandiose but misleading habit of referring to clubbing {{of the fingers}} as <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>osteoarthropathy.</b> Periosteal new-bone formation in osteoarthrop-athy is its distinct and unmistakable lesion and usually indicates cancer of the lung, but clubbing of the fingers itself has no such serious implication. Very rarely the characteristic sign of periosteal new-bone formation may occur {{in the absence of}} intrathoracic lesions (1, 2), and a similar condition, pachydermoperiostosis, is believed to have an autosomal-dominant form of inheritance (3). Clubbing of the fingers and periosteal new-bone formation may prove to be produced by similar or the same mechanisms, but, until we know that this is so, it is likely that our progress in understanding will be slowed if we confuse the two. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the syndrome of osteoarthropathy, but no single one is adequate to explain every case. Opinions are divided between neurogenic and humoral mechanisms, though both could be simultaneously active. The neurogenic theory arose from the ob-servations of Flavell (4) that regression of the symptoms and some of the signs of osteoarthrop-athy may follow section of a vagus nerve. A recent report suggests that vagotomy may have a beneficial effect in the congenital form of the disease (5). Our own observations in both hu-man and canine patients originally agreed with this theory (6). We found that the increase in blood flow to portions of the limbs affected by osteoarthropathy was promptly reduced by sec-tion or block of the vagus nerve, or nerves in the case of bilateral disease, and that regres...|$|R
50|$|A special form of {{clubbing}} is <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>osteoarthropathy,</b> {{known in}} continental Europe as Pierre Marie-Bamberger syndrome. This {{is the combination}} of clubbing and thickening of periosteum (connective tissue lining of the bones) and synovium (lining of joints), and is often initially diagnosed as arthritis.

50|$|Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (also {{known as}} <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>osteoarthropathy,</b> Bamberger-Marie {{syndrome}} or Osteoarthropathia hypertrophicans) {{is a medical}} condition combining clubbing and periostitis of the small hand joints, especially the distal interphalangeal joints and the metacarpophalangeal joints. Distal expansion of the long bones as well as painful, swollen joints and synovial villous proliferation are often seen. The condition may occur alone (primary), {{or it may be}} secondary to diseases like lung cancer. It is especially associated with non-small cell lung carcinoma. These patients often get clubbing and increased bone deposition on long bones. Their presenting symptoms are sometimes only clubbing and painful ankles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Prostate {{cancer is}} known to have a {{tendency}} to metastasize to bone. Skeletal scintigraphy can be used to show multiple lesions. Diffuse metastasis, which is not infrequent in prostate cancer, can also be suspected {{on the basis of a}} 'super scan'. However, this phenomenon in nuclear medicine has several other causes that need to be considered. Case presentation A patient with a history of prostate cancer presented with pleural fluid, peripheral edema and bone pain. A super scan of the bone was found which suggested diffuse skeletal metastasis of the prostate cancer but the patient also had a prostate specific antigen level which was not compatible with this diagnosis. Further investigations revealed the paraneoplastic phenomenon of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, related to an incurable carcinoma of the lung, to be the cause of the super scan. Conclusion A super scan is characterized by a high bone to soft tissue ratio on skeletal scintigraphy, with a uniform symmetrical increase in bone uptake and diminished to absent renal visualization ('absent kidney sign'). It can be seen in a variety of diseases in which there is a diffusely increased bone turnover. Diffuse skeletal metastasis of a well-differentiated prostate carcinoma is unlikely to be the cause of a super scan when the prostate specific antigen level is not elevated. This is the first report of a super scan due to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>osteoarthropathy</b> which can be seen in lung carcinoma and other pulmonary diseases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease that is precipitated by <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vascular remodeling of distal arterioles to increase pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular {{resistance in the}} absence of left heart, lung parenchymal, or thromboembolic disease. Despite available medical therapy, pulmonary artery remodeling and its attendant hemodynamic consequences result in right ventricular dysfunction, failure, and early death. To limit morbidity and mortality, attention has focused on identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant pulmonary artery remodeling to identify pathways for intervention. While there is a well-recognized heritable genetic component to PAH, there is also evidence of other genetic perturbations, including pulmonary vascular cell DNA damage, activation of the DNA damage response, and variations in microRNA expression. These findings likely contribute, in part, to dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis signaling pathways akin to what is observed in cancer; changes in cellular metabolism, metabolic flux, and mitochondrial function; and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition as key signaling pathways that promote pulmonary vascular remodeling. This review will highlight recent advances in the field with an emphasis on the aforementioned molecular mechanisms as contributors to the pulmonary vascular disease pathophenotype...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A case of Empyeme with <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> osteo arthropathy is described, who in {{addition}} developed arthralgia. {{probably due to}} Pyrazinamide.

Patient gave history of having developed pulmonary tuberculosis 3 years back {{for which he had}} taken Streptomycin 4. Isonex-f PAS treatment for 6 months. Two years back, he developed tuberculous empyema which was treated with Isoniazid, Pyrazmamide and Etham-butol for 2 years; intercestal drainage tube was put to drain out the empyema. On clinical examination there were findings of thickened pleura of right hemithorax with pus draining from the intercostal drainage tube. Exa-mination of bones and joints, showed the distal ends of Radius, Ulna, (Wrist) Humerus (Elbow), Femur (Knee), Tibia and Fibula (Ankle) were thickened on palpation and were tender. The knee joints were swollen, tender and there was restriction of movement, left more than right. Free fluid was present in the left knee joint and was demonstrated by positive patellar tap.

However, it was not until Bamberger in 1889 and Marie in 1890 de-scribed the syndrome of clubbing, bone and joint lesions, and their association with intrathoracic inflammatory conditions, that the phrase hyper-trophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy was coined. In the 80 years since then there have been only 39 paediatric cases fully documented and reported.

40|$|Rationale: In cardiomyocytes from failing hearts, {{insufficient}} mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation {{secondary to}} cytoplasmic Na+ overload decreases NAD(P) H/NAD(P) + redox potential and increases oxidative stress when workload increases.

Methods and Results: Here, we describe a novel guinea pig HF/SCD model using aortic constriction combined with daily β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (ACi) and show that chronic CGP treatment (ACi plus CGP) attenuates cardiac <b>hypertrophic</b> remodeling, <b>pulmonary</b> edema, and interstitial fibrosis and prevents cardiac dysfunction and SCD.
