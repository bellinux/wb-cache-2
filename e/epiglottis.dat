5|$|The {{blood vessels}} and lymph vessels are considered, the valves of the heart, and the {{separate}} functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions {{as that of the}} <b>epiglottis</b> could not have formed gradually (as by evolution).|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and <b>epiglottis,</b> urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the <b>epiglottis</b> moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> is {{normally}} pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning {{as part of}} the pharynx. During swallowing, elevation of the hyoid bone draws the larynx upward; as a result, the <b>epiglottis</b> folds down to a more horizontal position, with its superior side functioning {{as part of the}} pharynx. In this manner, the <b>epiglottis</b> prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is at the back. Should food or liquid enter the windpipe due to the <b>epiglottis</b> failing to close properly, the gag reflex is induced to protect the respiratory system.|$|E
25|$|In {{a direct}} {{section of the}} <b>epiglottis</b> {{it can be seen}} that the body {{consists}} of elastic cartilage. The <b>epiglottis</b> has two surfaces, a lingual and a laryngeal surface, related to the oral cavity and the larynx respectively.|$|E
25|$|When a vowel with {{an acute}} is articulated, {{articulators}} in mouth tense, the resonance of the <b>epiglottis</b> decreases and the larynx rises. When a vowel with a circumflex accent is articulates, the articulators are less tense, the resonance of the <b>epiglottis</b> increases and the larynx moves down.|$|E
25|$|There are {{taste buds}} on the <b>epiglottis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some languages, the <b>epiglottis</b> is used {{to produce}} epiglottal {{consonant}} speech sounds, though this sound-type is rather rare.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> {{is shaped}} {{somewhat}} like a leaf of purslane, with the stem {{attached to the}} posterior part of the thyroid cartilage.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Aristotle, although the epiglottis' function was first defined by Vesalius in 1543. It also has Greek roots.|$|E
25|$|The {{glossopharyngeal}} nerve (CN IX) sends fibers {{to the upper}} <b>epiglottis</b> {{that contribute to the}} afferent limb of the gag reflex. (The gag reflex is variable in people from a limited to a hypersensitive response.) The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) sends fibers to the lower <b>epiglottis</b> that contribute to the efferent limb of the cough reflex. This initiates an attempt to try to dislodge the food or liquid from the windpipe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> {{arises from}} the fourth {{pharyngeal}} arch. It {{can be seen as}} a distinct structure later than the other cartilage of the pharynx, visible around the fifth month of development.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> {{is one of}} nine {{cartilaginous}} {{structures that}} make up the larynx (voice box). During breathing, it lies completely within the larynx. During swallowing, it serves as part of the anterior of the pharynx.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} longitudinal muscle {{runs along}} the upper surface of the tongue under the mucous membrane, and elevates, assists in retraction of, or deviates {{the tip of the}} tongue. It originates near the <b>epiglottis,</b> at the hyoid bone, from the median fibrous septum.|$|E
25|$|Situated {{above the}} larynx, the <b>epiglottis</b> {{acts as a}} flap which closes off the trachea during the act of {{swallowing}} to direct food into the esophagus. If food or liquid does enter the trachea and contacts the vocal folds it causes a cough reflex to expel the matter {{in order to prevent}} pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{can develop}} in {{any part of}} the larynx, but the cure rate is {{affected}} by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of tumour staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (<b>epiglottis,</b> arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis.|$|E
25|$|Linnaeus {{described}} birds as: A {{beautiful and}} cheerful portion of created nature consisting of animals having a body covered with feathers and down; protracted and naked jaws (the beak), two wings formed for flight, and two feet. They are areal, vocal, swift and light, and destitute of external ears, lips, teeth, scrotum, womb, bladder, <b>epiglottis,</b> corpus callosum and its arch, and diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> is a flap made of elastic {{cartilage}} {{covered with a}} mucous membrane, attached {{to the entrance of}} the larynx. It projects obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the hyoid bone, pointing dorsally. It stands open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. During swallowing, it closes to prevent aspiration, forcing the swallowed liquids or food to go down the esophagus instead. It is thus the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Taste is the {{sensation}} produced when a substance {{in the mouth}} reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the <b>epiglottis.</b> The gustatory cortex {{is responsible for the}} perception of taste.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} tongue is, at its apex (or tip), {{thin and}} narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual {{surfaces of the}} lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the <b>epiglottis</b> by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane. It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the <b>epiglottis</b> {{is known}} as {{epiglottitis}}. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E
25|$|The trachealis muscle {{connects the}} ends of the {{incomplete}} rings and contracts during coughing, reducing the size of the lumen of the trachea to increase the rate of air flow. The esophagus lies posteriorly to the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe. Circular horizontal bands of fibrous tissue called the annular ligaments of trachea join the tracheal rings together. The cartilaginous rings are incomplete to allow the trachea to collapse slightly so that food can pass down the esophagus. A flap-like <b>epiglottis</b> closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing to prevent swallowed matter from entering the trachea.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Jewish thought has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} all meat must come from animals which have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These strict guidelines require the animal be killed by a single cut across the throat to a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the <b>epiglottis</b> and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death. Orthodox Jews argue that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, arguing that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called {{for it to be}} banned.|$|E
25|$|Articulation is {{the process}} by which the joint product of the {{vibrator}} and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("labial consonants"), the flexible front of the tongue ("coronal consonants"), the middle/back of the tongue ("dorsal consonants"), the root of the tongue together with the <b>epiglottis</b> ("pharyngeal consonants"), and the glottis ("glottal consonants"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation.|$|E
25|$|Mondino's {{description}} of the human heart, though inaccurate, is fairly detailed. He discusses three chambers: the right ventricle, the left ventricle, and a middle ventricle within the septum. The right ventricle is purported to contain a large opening, through which the heart draws blood originating in the liver, {{as well as the}} opening of the vena arterialis toward the lung. The left ventricle contains an orifice with three valves and the bivalvular opening of the arteria venalis, which allows the passage of a smoke-like vapor from the lungs. Despite these anatomical shortcomings, the vena chili (Mondino's name for the vena cava) is noteworthy in its accuracy. He then moves on to the lungs, describing the course of the vena arterialis (pulmonary artery) and the arteria venalis (pulmonary vein). This section of Anathomia also describes the pleura and notes the importance of distinguishing between pulmonary pathologies including true pleurisy, false pleurisy, and pneumonia. His descriptions of the larynx and <b>epiglottis</b> are very rudimentary.|$|E
500|$|The auditory, or [...] "acoustic" [...] {{abnormalities}} {{observed with}} the syndrome include {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and hoarseness. Two affected Turkish brothers with a mild form of this hearing loss, and a hoarse voice were reported. A laryngoscopic examination of both brothers revealed swelling of the vocal cords, and a malformed <b>epiglottis.</b> Sensorineural-associated hearing impairment and hoarsness was also observed in a 10-year-old girl and her father, and {{in a number of}} other cases.|$|E
500|$|The {{esophagus}} (American English) or oesophagus (British English) (...) , {{commonly known}} as the food pipe or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a [...] tube, about 25centimetres long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the <b>epiglottis</b> tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word esophagus is the Greek word οἰσοφάγος oisophagos, meaning [...] "gullet".|$|E
500|$|As a foal, he was nicknamed [...] "Junior" [...] {{because of}} his {{resemblance}} to his sire, Lucky Pulpit. [...] Lucky Pulpit had won three races, placed in several graded stakes races, and hit the board in 13 of his 22 starts. However, a viral respiratory infection damaged his breathing and limited him to racing over short distances. California Chrome's dam is Love the Chase, and he was her first foal. She was purchased for $30,000 as a two-year-old by an agent for a horse ownership group called the Blinkers On Racing Stable. As a two- and three-year-old filly, she was anxious in the saddling paddock, and as a result, often lost races before she ever got to the starting gate. She ran six times and won on her fourth try in a February 2009 maiden claiming race at Golden Gate Fields. After her win, Steve Coburn and Perry Martin became her owners, ran her two more times, then retired her later that year. They hoped she would become a good broodmare, as she had a promising pedigree. When she retired, {{it was discovered that}} she had raced with a breathing problem—an entrapped <b>epiglottis</b> that restricted her air intake, but which could be corrected with surgery. [...] , she had given birth to four foals, the two fillies and a colt, all full siblings to California Chrome. After California Chrome became a Kentucky Derby contender, Martin and Coburn turned down an offer of $2.1million for Love the Chase, and ultimately sold her in November 2016 for $1.95 million.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{striking}} advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Two {{of the most}} famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus. These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research. They also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance – Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart. Herophilus’s knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum [...] During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. His distinction between the arteries and veins – the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the <b>epiglottis</b> and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons [...] and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the [...] "seat of intellect" [...] and not a [...] "cooling chamber" [...] as propounded by Aristotle [...] Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>epiglottis</b> {{gets its}} name from being above the glottis ( [...] + glottis).|$|E
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the <b>epiglottis</b> and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the <b>epiglottis,</b> which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|E
2500|$|The trachea, colloquially {{called the}} windpipe, is a {{cartilaginous}} tube {{that connects the}} pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At {{the top of the}} trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx. This is the only complete tracheal ring, the others being incomplete rings of reinforcing cartilage. The trachealis muscle joins the ends of the rings and these are joined vertically by bands of fibrous connective tissue – the annular ligaments of trachea. [...] The <b>epiglottis</b> closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.|$|E
2500|$|The oropharynx, at {{the back}} of the mouth, forms a circle and {{includes}} the base of the tongue (posterior third) below, the tonsils on each side, and the soft palate above, together with the walls of the pharynx, including the [...] anterior <b>epiglottis,</b> epiglottic valleculae and branchial cleft at its base. [...] The oropharynx is one of three divisions of the interior of the pharynx based on their relation to adjacent structures (nasal pharynx (nasopharynx), oral pharynx (oropharynx) and laryngeal pharynx (laryngopharynx - also referred to as the hypopharynx), from top to bottom). The pharynx is a semicircular fibromuscular tube joining the nasal cavities above to the larynx (voice box) and oesophagus (gullet), below, where the larynx is situated in front of the oesophagus.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, <b>epiglottis</b> and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. [...] Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.|$|E
2500|$|Despite all this, {{scholars}} remain divided {{as to how}} [...] "special" [...] {{the human}} vocal tract really is. It {{has been shown that}} the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the <b>epiglottis</b> and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costsnbsp&— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing foodnbsp&— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefitnbsp&— so it is claimednbsp&— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact not seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was initially driven by selection pressures for speech.|$|E
