I {{wanted to make the}} album with Tore—that was the plan. After he died I just didn't think I had the heart. But then I thought, 'Right, you're really depressed now but you have to make this album. Tore would be quite pissed off if you just stopped doing anything.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{has been}} {{critical}} of the flower power movement, which occurred {{toward the end of the}} decade, saying [...] "Rock became a corporate classification, just like the blues. They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the '60s, and that's when it started to mean zero to me." [...] He added, [...] "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to Woodstock. I didn't want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> my office at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was working so hard and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was reported, however, {{that the}} rescue {{operation}} was [...] "chaotic". BBC journalist Zeesha Zafar reported that [...] "there were fewer rescue workers there than {{one would have}} expected. A majority of them {{were members of the}} anti-terrorism police. Most of them just stood around, gazing at the burning debris, and looking as though there was not much that they could do." [...] He stated that a police officer threatened to baton charge rescuers if they did not [...] "move quickly". Zafar reported that [...] "just when the rescuers were shuffling to get to work, a policeman in plain clothes announced that an army helicopter was coming in to pour water on the fire, and that everyone should get out of the way. The work stopped. The helicopter came, circled on the spot a couple of times, and went away. No water." [...] Zafar went on that it [...] "was distinctly obvious that there was no co-ordination between the workers of different departments such as the police, the rescue department, the Capital Development Authority and the military ... Rescuers operated in a chaotic manner, scouring through the debris that was not on fire ... During the two hours that <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> the scene, I saw rescuers collect three separate loads of body parts which they tied up in shrouds. There was no telling how many people they belonged to." ...|$|E

60|$|We dined at home; Mr. Davidoff and his tutor kept an {{engagement}} {{with us to}} dinner notwithstanding {{the death of the}} Emperor Alexander. They went to the play with the womankind; <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> home to write.|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite time <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> home, I can see. All the same, the fellow's {{rather a}} puzzle.
