5|$|<b>Directed</b> pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a <b>directed</b> pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting <b>directed</b> pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal <b>directed</b> pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal <b>directed</b> pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal <b>directed</b> pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E

40|$|There {{appear to}} be some {{problems}} in defining <b>direct</b> marketing. Bauer and Miglautsch (1992) present <b>direct</b> marketing as a relational marketing process. According to Schofield (1995 : 36), "Such a definition excludes much marketing work which employs individual <b>direct</b> marketing techniques on a pragmatic and eclectic basis, alongside nondirect marketing elements, and in which {{the use of such}} techniques is normally seen as <b>direct</b> marketing". He suggests that two definitions may be needed: a general, inclusive definition of <b>direct</b> marketing, e. g. the DMA-definition, which allows any use of any <b>direct</b> marketing technique to be recognized as an instance of <b>direct</b> marketing, and a definition of a <b>direct</b> marketing system, e. g. Bauer and Miglautsch's definition, covering cases where a product or service is marketed exclusively by <b>direct</b> marketing methods (Schofield 1995 : 37). This distinction suggests that several levels of <b>direct</b> marketing can be distinguished. The definition of <b>direct</b> marketing as proposed by Raaijmaakers et al. (1992) allows for distinguishing several levels of <b>direct</b> marketing without the need for more than one definition. They stress the importance of <b>direct</b> relationships and the specific use of marketing instruments. Based on their definition, four levels of <b>direct</b> marketing can be distinguished (Hoekstra 1994). Three of them concern strategic decisions and one is at the operational level (see table 1). These types cover the ever broadening field of <b>direct</b> marketing, including the <b>direct</b> marketing system as well as the use of <b>direct</b> marketing methods. ...|$|R
5|$|In <b>directed</b> planar graphs, simple <b>directed</b> cycles are dual to <b>directed</b> cuts (partitions of the {{vertices}} {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to <b>directed</b> acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a <b>directed</b> acyclic graph).|$|E
