40|$|Insomnia and {{fragmentation}} are {{features of}} the sleep of these patients. In order to list the factors disturbing the sleep of demented nursing home patients and the interventions improving their sleep quality, the literature was reviewed. A Medline search over the period 1966 - 2000 was performed. This resulted in 22 research articles. Admission {{to a nursing home}} is associated with sleep disturbances caused by patient problems (e. g. pain), care routines (e. g. nightly nursing round) and environment (e. g. noise). There are indications that the use of hypnotics in nursing home patients is not always effective and increases the risk of falls. There are several ways to reduce hypnotic consumption in nursing homes. Non-pharmacological interventions to decrease sleep disturbances caused by <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> have a favourable although weak effect on sleep itself. By reducing nightly noise, sleep quality does not necessarily improve. Light therapy seems to be the most effective non-pharmacological method to strengthen the circadian sleep/wake rhythm. The struggle against insomnia without using medication perhaps requires a two tracks management: detection and elimination of <b>disturbing</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> and implementation of an adequate method to strengthen the circadian sleep/wake rhythm. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Circadian rhythms in {{critically}} ill patients are significantly <b>disturbed</b> due to <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> (lack of change between light and dark, noise), sleep deprivation, different medications or disease itself. Such circadian deregulation usually appears {{with a change}} in amplitude of the 24  h cycle of different circadian biomarkers, such as melatonin and cortisol urine excretion, characterized by an almost flattened time series with reduced fluctuations. Moreover, peak time can display a phase shift and occur at different than the usual time of day or night [24]. It has been postulated that ‘loss of amplitude might impair the capacity for adaptation,’ whereas phase shift ‘uncouples maximum function from peak demand’ [25].|$|R
40|$|Biofilms are polymicrobial, {{with diverse}} {{bacterial}} species competing for limited space and nutrients. Under healthy conditions, the different species in biofilms maintain an ecological balance. This balance can be <b>disturbed</b> by <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> and interspecies interactions. These perturbations can enable dominant growth of certain species, leading to disease. To model clinically relevant interspecies antagonism, we studied three well-characterized and closely related oral species, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis, and cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. S. sanguinis and S. gordonii used oxygen availability and the differential production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) to compete effectively against S. mutans. Interspecies antagonism {{was influenced by}} glucose with reduced production of H 2 O 2. Furthermore, aerobic conditions stimulated the competence system and {{the expression of the}} bacteriocin mutacin IV of S. mutans, as well as the H 2 O 2 -dependent release of heterologous DNA from mixed cultures of S. sanguinis and S. gordonii. These data provide new insights into ecological factors that determine the outcome of competition between pioneer colonizing oral streptococci and the survival mechanisms of S. mutans in the oral biofilm...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} such as type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) and asthma are leading causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. The {{increase in the number of}} children with chronic diseases is a major concern. Early detection through improved screening and diagnostic tests, better diagnosis based on updated guidelines, and improved drug therapy have led to more effective treatment of chronic illnesses. The studies included in this thesis focused on different aspects related to pediatric chronic disorders including T 1 DM, asthma and allergy. We have investigated the trends in prevalence and incidence rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, asthma and related-medications use in children with T 1 DM and evaluated genetic and <b>environmental</b> risk <b>factors</b> associated with the occurrence of childhood asthma, asthma exacerbations and allergy. Our studies in children with T 1 DM demonstrated that these children have higher prevalence rates of CVD risk factors and use of CV medication compared with age and gender-matched children without diabetes. The higher risk was already present one year before the onset of diabetes and further increased over the years of follow-up. However, there was substantial under-treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in children with T 1 DM. Our studies also showed a high rate of poor glycemic control (HbA 1 c> 7. 5 % (58 mmol/mol)) in the pediatric population with T 1 DM. There are strong indications that genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> increase the risk of developing asthma and allergy in children. Our findings showed that a genetic risk score developed in adults with asthma also predicts asthma in children. The results of our meta-analysis including 34 published studies on the association between early life antibiotics use and the risk of long-term allergy suggested thatexposure to antibiotics during the first two years of life is associated with an increased risk of allergic symptoms including hay fever, eczema and food allergy later in life. Moreover, our thesis suggested a long-term protective effect of breast-feeding on asthma exacerbations. It is known that gut microbiome is influenced by <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b> The healthy gut microbiome is highly diverse and can be <b>disturbed</b> by <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> e. g. early life antibiotic therapy and breast-feeding. Reduced gut microbiome diversity during the first months of life might influence the immune system and might lead to increased risk of asthma and allergy. However, the role of early life factors on risk of later asthma, asthma exacerbations and allergies needs further elucidation...|$|R

Avionics is one of the fields in which aging and damaging of cables can cause severe accidents. The most important advantages of wireless systems in avionics are weight reduction, resulting in less fuel consumption, flexibility, ease of layout, maintenance and modification. In this contribution, replacement of wired-based safety-critical data communication systems in an aircraft with wireless systems, in terms of safety and reliability is discussed. Under the scope of this work, the conceptual baseline study on wireless flight control systems is carried out. A point-to-point data transmission for a wireless flight control network is simulated considering safety constraints. Therefore, relevant transmission parameters of the wireless system are evaluated, which improve safety level of the wireless transmission. To assess the safety and reliability of the system, failure sources are studied and effects of most influential <b>environmental</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>factors</b> on the simulated data link are investigated. As a result, effects of changing environmental conditions on the wireless data link for the concept of flight control system are analyzed...|$|R

A total 28 usable questionnaires were received out of the 40 distributed to Kenyan expatriates. The data obtained was analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation with the help of statistical computer packages specifically Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS.

30|$|Studies on {{the effects}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> during the crop growth period could provide {{accurate}} information for evaluating the impact of climate on crop production. The effects of genotype, environment, and genotype × environment interaction determine the phenotypic performance and its general and specific adaptation to different environmental conditions (Balakrishnan et al. 2016). The genotype of plants can be determined through molecular and genomic approaches using DNA markers and high-throughput sequencing (Koboldt et al. 2013). However, the determination and measurement of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> are relatively difficult and are largely due to two reasons. First, <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> are highly dynamic and constantly changing during the plant growth period, and the simple average or sum of all data cannot explain the complex effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors.</b> Second, <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> are nontrivial to be zoomed into specific individual plants so that the environmental data could be matched to the corresponding genotype. Dissecting various quantitative traits into individual Mendelian factors using molecular markers has accelerated the quantitative genetics walk out from the multiple gene investigation (Paterson et al. 1988; Lander and Botstein 1989). Dissecting complex environments into individual factors and measuring individual plants during the entire growth period may dramatically improve our understanding of the effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> on crop production (Xu 2016). Because grain yield, quality, and stress resistance are complex traits that are affected by the environment, the selection of genotypes based on performance under a single environmental condition is inadequate for the elucidation of the effect of an <b>environmental</b> <b>factor</b> on crop production. An investigation based on a multi-environment may provide more information of the effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> on crop production.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Both {{genetic and}} <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> {{contribute}} to human diseases. Most common diseases {{are influenced by}} {{a large number of}} genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>factors,</b> most of which individually have only a modest effect on the disease. Though genetic contributions are relatively well characterized for some monogenetic diseases, there has been no effort at curating the extensive list of <b>environmental</b> etiological <b>factors.</b> Results From a comprehensive search of the MeSH annotation of MEDLINE articles, we identified 3, 342 <b>environmental</b> etiological <b>factors</b> associated with 3, 159 diseases. We also identified 1, 100 genes associated with 1, 034 complex diseases from the NIH Genetic Association Database (GAD), a database of genetic association studies. 863 diseases have both genetic and <b>environmental</b> etiological <b>factors</b> available. Integrating genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> results in the "etiome", which we define as the comprehensive compendium of disease etiology. Clustering of <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> may alert clinicians of the risks of added exposures, or synergy in interventions to alter these factors. Clustering of both genetic and <b>environmental</b> etiological <b>factors</b> puts genes in the context of environment in a quantitative manner. Conclusion In this paper, we obtained a comprehensive list of associations between disease and <b>environmental</b> <b>factors</b> using MeSH annotation of MEDLINE articles. It serves as a summary of current knowledge between etiological factors and diseases. By combining the <b>environmental</b> etiological <b>factors</b> and genetic factors from GAD, we computed the "etiome" profile for 863 diseases. Comparing diseases across these profiles may have utility for clinical medicine, basic science research, and population-based science. </p...|$|R
