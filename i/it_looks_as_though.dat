5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we're too late '.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century a misericord at Gloucester cathedral, England shows {{two young}} men playing a ball game. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable {{for the fact that}} most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the present}} moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, {{following}} a long walk, he and the prince find a well. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars {{to think of the}} prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E

500|$|Hurley, Jin and Sawyer raid the van {{and find}} maps and beer. Meanwhile, Hurley tells Charlie to stop moping and help him start the car, saying that he might die doing it but they should make their own luck, face death, and {{possibly}} win. Hurley eventually convinces the others to push the van to a slope {{in order to get}} it started. Despite Sawyer's warnings, Hurley goes through with the plan. Charlie declares [...] "victory or death" [...] and rides with Hurley, as Sawyer and Jin push the vehicle down the steep hill. At first <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they will crash, but the van starts just in time. Later, the entire group enjoys a ride.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nebraska" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen {{felt that the}} episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were [...] "beautifully acted". In his A– review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that [...] "Nebraska" [...] accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere {{for the second half}} of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience [...] "plenty to chew on", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; [...] "'Nebraska' doesn’t entirely rectify this concern, but it’s a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; [...] "I liked how this episode thrust us right back into it, and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing—a mixture this show can do very well." [...] Concluding his review, Goldman issued [...] "Nebraska" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: [...] "'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating things that happened earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...] But just when <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, [...] "Nebraska" [...] surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that [...] "Nebraska" [...] was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was [...] "just one huge whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode.|$|E

[...] He played right tackle in the game against Vanderbilt university last Saturday and made consistent gains when given the ball. [...] According to reports of the game Reinschild hit the opposing line low and hard and his work was a factor in winning a decisive victory for 'Hurry Up' Yost's team. [...] <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Reinschild would be a fixture on the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna {{created a}} Facebook {{campaign}} page entitled [...] "Rihanna: UNLOCKED" [...] , whereby her fans on Facebook are given missions to complete, {{in the form}} of games, in order to [...] "unlock" [...] new information about the album. Upon the unveiling of the standard edition's artwork, both James Dinh of MTV and a reviewer for NME commented that Rihanna looks [...] "seductive" [...] in the image. Gordon Smart of The Sun humorously criticized the standard edition artwork by saying that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the singer is trying to cover up a cold sore with her tongue, writing [...] "It's easy to pick them up {{at this time of year}} – especially as she's constantly naked or attached to her new boyfriend Dudley O'Shaughnessy by the lips." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it might all end next Wednesday, from where you're standing. I don't have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the report, D'Aleo and Watts {{claim that}} “Just as the Medieval Warm Period was an {{obstacle}} to those trying to suggest that today’s temperature is exceptional, and the UN and its supporters tried to abolish it with the 'hockey-stick' graph, the warmer temperatures in the 1930s and 1940s were another inconvenient fact {{that needed to be}} 'fixed'. In each of the databases, the land temperatures from that period were simply adjusted downward, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the rate of warming in the 20th century was higher than it was, and making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> today’s temperatures were unprecedented in at least 150 years.” ...|$|R

2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday". [...] "Yesterday" [...] begins with the lines: [...] "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they're here to stay." [...] In its second stanza, [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] has the lines: [...] "You were mine yesterday. I believed that love was here to stay. Won't you tell me where I've gone astray".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} and final {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of [...] "Hound Dog", [...] "Love Me Tender", and [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", followed by a full version of [...] "Don't Be Cruel". For a second set later in the show he did [...] "Too Much" [...] and [...] "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again". For his last set he sang [...] "Peace in the Valley". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the rumor had it that [...] "Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> his pecker reaches down to his knee!" [...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads. [...] "Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows", Greil Marcus says, Elvis [...] "stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent." ...|$|E
