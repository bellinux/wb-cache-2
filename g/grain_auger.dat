40|$|Pd/SiC Schottky diodes detect {{hydrogen}} and hydrocarbons with high sensitivity. Variation of the diode temperature from 100 C to 200 C {{shows that the}} diode sensitivity to propylene is temperature dependent. Long-term heat treating at 425 C up to 140 hours is carried out {{to determine the effect}} of extended heat treating on the diode properties and gas sensitivity. The heat treating significantly affects the diode's capacitive characteristics, but the diode's current carrying characteristics are much more stable with a large response to hydrogen. Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Spectrometry studies of the Pd surface after the heating show cluster formation and background regions with grain structure observed in both regions. The Pd and Si concentrations vary between <b>grains.</b> <b>Auger</b> Electron Spectroscopy depth profiles revealed that the heat treating promoted interdiffusion and reaction between the Pd and SiC dw broadened the interface region. This work shows that Pd/SiC Schottky diodes have significant potential as high temperature gas sensors, but stabilization of the structure is necessary to insure their repeatability in long-term, high temperature applications...|$|R

After local opposition and {{the purchase of the}} track between Dakota Junction and Chadron by Nebraska Northwestern Railroad, the large loading facility was instead built near Alliance, Nebraska and a much smaller $800,000 <b>grain</b> loading <b>auger</b> was built east of Chadron.|$|R
40|$|The {{aluminides}} NbAl 3 and NiAl {{may show}} accelerated oxidation {{in a range}} of intermediate temperatures 600 - 1000 °C, especially at reduced oxygen pressures. Such pressures in the range 10 - 2 to 10 - 30 bar O 2 have been established for exposures in ampoules with the specimens, by enclosing also buffer mixtures such as Cu-Cu 2 O, Fe 3 O 4 -Fe 2 O 3, Ni-NiO etc. NbAl 3 disintegrates into small particles (pesting) and NiAl shows internal oxidation, general or localized, and oxidation along <b>grain</b> boundaries. <b>Auger</b> analyses afier oxidation confirmed that oxygen penetrates into grain boundaries of NbAl 3 and NiAl. The transport of oxygen through the outer oxide layer appears to be rate controlling, in the case of NbAl 3 such transport is possible through Nb 2 O 5 in the scale {{and in the case of}} NiAl through other defects caused by insufficient supply of oxygen in the exposures...|$|R

50|$|A chaser bin, {{also called}} grain cart or (<b>grain)</b> <b>auger</b> wagon, is a trailer towed by a tractor with a {{built-in}} auger conveyor system, usually with a large capacity (from several hundred to over 1000 bushels; around 15 t is average).|$|E
5000|$|Often, when {{unloading}} <b>grain</b> from an <b>auger</b> {{or other}} {{opening at the}} bottom of the silo, another worker will be atop the grain [...] "walking it down", to ensure an even flow of grain out of the silo. Sometimes unstable pockets in the grain will collapse beneath the worker doing the walking; this is called grain entrapment as the worker can be completely sunk into the grain within seconds. Entrapment can also occur in moving grain, or when workers clear large clumps of grain that have become stuck on the side of the silo. This often results in death by suffocation.|$|R

5000|$|One {{traditional}} {{remedy is}} {{to spread the}} grain in thin layers on a floor, where it is turned to aerate it thoroughly. Once the grain is sufficiently dry it can be transferred to a granary for storage. A modern variation on this, {{is to use a}} <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> to move grain stored in one grainery to another.|$|E
5000|$|A {{specialized}} form of <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> is used {{to transfer}} grain into a seed drill, and is usually quite a lot smaller in both length and diameter than the augers used to transfer grain to or from a truck, grain cart or bin. This type of auger {{is known as a}} [...] "drill fill". Grain augers with a small diameter, regardless of the use they are put to, are often called [...] "pencil augers".|$|E
50|$|Arendzz {{was born}} on 3 March 1990 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. At the age of seven, he lost his left arm when he lost his balance putting corn into a <b>grain</b> <b>auger.</b> His arm up to his {{shoulder}} {{was caught in the}} blades and later amputated in Halifax. After the accident, he worked as a junior counselor for the War Amps organization.

5000|$|The [...] "grain auger" [...] {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to move grain from trucks, grain carts or grain trailers into grain storage bins (from where it is later removed by gravity chutes at the bottom). A <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> may be powered by an electric motor; a tractor, through the power take-off; or sometimes an internal combustion engine mounted on the auger. The helical rotates inside a long metal tube, moving the grain upwards. On the lower end, a hopper receives grain from the truck or grain cart. A chute on the upper end guides the grain into the destination location.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 Peter Pakosh, {{while working}} for Massey Harris, built the first <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> in the {{basement}} of his Toronto home. When the idea was presented to his superiors, it was rejected out of fears that metal to metal contacts would pose a fire hazard. Undeterred, Pakosh founded Hydraulic Engineering Co. Later observing the growing role of chemical sprays in agriculture, he designed a spray so simple it could be repaired with [...] "haywire and spit". The Versatile sprayer was enough of a success that Pakosh renamed his company. In 1962 the first Versatile swather was introduced, and within one year controlled 60% of the market ...|$|E
5000|$|The modern <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> of today's farming {{communities}} {{was invented}} by Peter Pakosh. His grain mover employed a screw-type auger {{with a minimum of}} moving parts, a totally new application for this specific use. At Massey Harris (later Massey Ferguson), young Pakosh approached the design department in the 1940s with his auger idea, but was scolded and told that his idea was unimaginable and that once the auger aged and bent that the metal on metal would, according to a head Massey designer, [...] "start fires all across Canada". Pakosh, however, went on to design and build a first prototype auger in 1945, and 8 years later start selling tens of thousands under the 'Versatile' name, making it the standard for modern grain augers.|$|E

40|$|Yield {{monitoring}} system constructed for combine harvester {{was able to}} monitor and store required, measured attributes during field tests. A rugged, wireless crop yield monitoring instrumentation system was employed on a rice combine harvester to measure instantaneous rice yield in this study.   A mild steel chute mounted with SWR SolidFlow microwave type flow sensor and SWR M-Sens 2 microwave type moisture sensor were located at the end top of the clean <b>grain</b> <b>auger</b> of the combine harvester to the flow rate of the dropped grain into the grain storage tank and measure the moisture content of the grain transferred by the auger. The objective of conducted performance test was to check both the operational and robustness of the instrumentation system under the actual harvesting operation with the combine in the paddy field.   During harvesting, the embedded system, DGPS, router and all sensors within the instrumentation system functioned reliable. Instrumentation system records combined multiple data by following moisture content (%), cutting width (mm), elevator rotation speed (RPM) and combine speed (km/hr).

40|$|Expert {{systems can}} be {{utilised}} for machine condition monitoring data interpretation due {{to the ability to}} identify a systematic reasoning process, and conventional methods requiring highly trained professional labour. The expert system developed in conjunction with this paper has been designed for interpreting vibration spectra in machine condition monitoring. The methods employed by the expert system’s analysis algorithm include spectral analysis as the primary technique, and time domain as well as demodulated spectral analysis as the secondary techniques. The secondary techniques are used for improved interpretation confidence, if the data is available. The algorithm has been developed for industries operating constant speed gearboxes, as is common in the power generation, mining and mineral processing sectors. The vibration analysis expert system operates from a knowledge base that was designed using a combination of common handbook reasoning logic for frequency spectra interpretation, and extracted knowledge of experts in the vibration analysis field. The expert system has been tested as a stand-alone system using data obtained from numerous laboratory tests, as well as industry data from a <b>grain</b> <b>auger.</b> The tests showed good flexibility in early detection as well as fault monitoring capability. This was achieved by a number of user changeable variables which govern the detection sensitivity...|$|E
