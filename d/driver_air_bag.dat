40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the dynamic injury tolerance {{of the male}} forearm, derived from dynamic three-point bending tests using ten male cadaver upper extremities. The impact loading conditions were chosen to be representative of those observed during upper extremity interaction with frontal air bags. Using matched forearm pairs, {{it was determined that}} the forearm is signicantly (p= 0. 01) stronger in the supinated position, 126 ± 13 N m, than in the pronated position, 108 ± 8 N m. Two distinct fracture patterns were seen for the pronated and supinated groups. In the supinated position the average diVerence in fracture time between the radius and ulna was not signicantly diVerent (p= 0. 24); however, the pronated tests yielded an average diVerence in fracture time that was signicantly diVerent (p= 0. 05), with the ulna breaking before the radius in every test. This trend implies that in the pronated position the ulna and radius are loaded independently, while in the supinated position the ulna and radius are loaded together as a combined structure. To produce a conservative injury criterion, only the data from the pronated tests were included for an average failure tolerance of 108 N m. It is anticipated that these data will provide injury reference values for the male forearm during <b>driver</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> loading...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic injury tolerances {{for the female}} humerus and forearm derived from dynamic 3 -point bending tests using 22 female cadaver upper extremities. Twelve female humeri were tested at an average strain rate of 3. 7 ± 1. 3 %/s. The strain rates were chosen to be representative of those observed during upper extremity interaction with frontal and side airbags. The average moment to failure when mass scaled for the 5 th centile female was 128 ± 19 Nm. Using data from the in situ strain gauges during the drop tests and geometric properties obtained from pretest CT scans, an average dynamic elastic modulus for the female humerus {{was found to be}} 24. 4 ± 3. 9 GPa. The injury tolerance for the forearm was determined from 10 female forearms tested at an average strain rate of 3. 94 ± 2. 0 %/s. Using 3 matched forearm pairs, it was determined that the forearm is 21 % stronger in the supinated position (92 ± 5 Nm) versus the pronated position (75 ± 7 Nm). Two distinct fracture patterns were seen for the pronated and supinated groups. In the supinated position the average difference in fracture time between the radius and ulna was a negligible 0. 4 ± 0. 3 ms. However, the pronated tests yielded an average difference in fracture time of 3. 6 ± 1. 2 ms, with the ulna breaking before the radius in every test. This trend implies that in the pronated position, the ulna and radius are loaded independently, while in the supinated position the ulna and radius are loaded together as a combined structure. To produce a conservative injury criterion, a total of 7 female forearms were tested in the pronated position, which resulted in the forearm injury criterion of 58 ± 12 Nm when scaled for the 5 th centile female. It is anticipated that these data will provide injury reference values for the female forearm during <b>driver</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> loading, and the female humerus during side air bag loading...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{analysis}} provided effectiveness {{estimates of}} the driver-side <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> while controlling for severity of the crash and other potential confounders. METHODS: Data were from the National Automotive Sampling System (1993 - 1996). Injury severity was described {{on the basis of}} the Abbreviated Injury Scale, Injury Severity Score, Functional Capacity Index, and survival. Ordinal, linear, and logistic multivariate regression methods were used. RESULTS: <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment in frontal or near-frontal crashes decreases the probability of having severe and fatal injuries (e. g., Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 4 - 6), including those causing a long-lasting high degree of functional limitation. However, <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment in low-severity crashes increases the probability that a driver (particularly a woman) will sustain injuries of Abbreviated Injury Scale level 1 to 3. <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment exerts a net injurious effect in low-severity crashes and a net protective effect in high-severity crashes. The level of crash severity at which <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> are protective is higher for female than for male <b>drivers.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> improvement should minimize the injuries induced by their deployment.

40|$|Abstract: Several crash {{discrimination}} algorithms {{have been}} developed {{in order to have}} timely <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment during frontal crashes. However, it is still challenging to have timely <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deploy-ment, especially during pole, underride, oblique and oVset crashes. Therefore, in this paper, a new algorithm for frontal crash discrimination is proposed, with the summation of the absolute value of the deceleration change being used as a metric and with the metric and its threshold being processed {{as a function of the}} velocity change. The new algorithm was applied to frontal crashes of a minivan and a sports utility vehicle, and it resulted in timely <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment for frontal crashes, including pole, underride, oblique and oVset crashes. Moreover, it is proposed that an accelerometer be installed on each side of the rockers or pillars to assess the crash severity of each side and to deploy <b>driver</b> and passenger <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> at diVerent times, especially during an asymmetric crash such as an oblique and an oVset crash. As an example, the deceleration signals measured at the left and right B-pillar/rocker locations were processed through the algorithm, and earlier time-to-res (TTFs) were obtained for the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> on the struck side than for the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> on the non-struck side...|$|R
40|$|US <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> {{regulations}} were changed in 1997 to allow tests of unbelted male dummies in vehicles mounted and accelerated on sleds, resulting in longer crash pulses than rigid-barrier crashes.
