40|$|Background: Step width is {{increased}} during dual-belt treadmill walking, in self-paced mode with virtual reality. Generally a <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> {{is thought to}} be necessary to normalize step width. Aim: The aim of this randomised study was to analyze the effects of two interventions on step width, to reduce the <b>familiarization</b> <b>period.</b> Methods: We used the GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab), a dual-belt treadmill with virtual reality in the self-paced mode. Thirty healthy young adults were randomly allocated to three groups and asked to walk at their preferred speed for 5 min. In the first session, the control-group received no intervention, the 'walk-on-the-line'-group was instructed to walk on a line, projected on the between-belt gap of the treadmill and the feedback-group received feedback about their current step width and were asked to reduce it. Interventions started after 1 min and lasted 1 min. During the second session, 7 - 10 days later, no interventions were given. Findings: Linear mixed modeling showed that interventions did not have an effect on step width after the intervention period in session 1. Initial step width (second 30 s) of session 1 was larger than initial step width of session 2. Step width normalized after 2 min and variation in step width stabilized after 1 min. Interpretation: Interventions do not reduce step width after intervention period. A 2 -min <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> is sufficient to normalize and stabilize step width, in healthy young adults, regardless of interventions.

To improve binaural hearing in bilaterally implanted cochlear implant (BiCI) users, a coding strategy providing the best possible access to IPD is highly desirable. In this study, we compared two coding strategies in BiCI users provided with CI systems from MED-EL (Innsbruck, Austria). The CI systems were bilaterally programmed either with the fine structure processing strategy FS 4 or with the constant rate strategy high definition continuous interleaved sampling (HDCIS). <b>Familiarization</b> <b>periods</b> between 6 and 12 weeks were considered. The effect of IPD was measured in two types of experiments: (a) IPD detection thresholds with tonal signals addressing mainly one apical interaural electrode pair and (b) with speech in noise in terms of binaural speech intelligibility level differences (BILD) addressing multiple electrodes bilaterally. The results in (a) showed improved IPD detection thresholds with FS 4 compared with HDCIS in four out of the seven BiCI users. In contrast, 12 BiCI users in (b) showed similar BILD with FS 4 (0. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 9 [*]dB) and HDCIS (0. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 0 [*]dB). However, no correlation between results in (a) and (b) both obtained with FS 4 was found.

Eleven players from a Norwegian elite female football club was included in project I, and ten players in project II. Participants in project I were split into two groups, plyometric (PLY, n= 6) and maximum strength (MAX, n= 5). Both groups performed two strengthtraining sessions a week for 10 -weeks. MAX performed two maximum strength sessions, and PLY performed one maximum strength session and one plyometric session. Players was tested for 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) strength in squat, bench-press and pull-down, as well as performance in 10 - and 30 -m sprint, countermovement jump (CMJ) on force platform, repeated sprint (6 x 30 -m), Yo-yo intermittent recovery level 1 (Yoyo IR 1) and muscle architecture pre- and post to the training period. For project II, load-monitoring data were collected through a series of methods including session rate of perceived exertion (sRPE), pre training wellness questionnaire (PTW), neuromuscular fatigue jump test (NMF), and coaches votes (CV). Both groups had a substantial increase in 1 RM squat (PLY = 10. 4 ± 7. 1 kg effect size; ES= 0. 80, MAX = 18. 1 ± 7. 7 kg ES= 0. 80; mean ± 90 % confidence limits; CL), a moderate effect was found between groups being greater for MAX (ES = 0. 85, 94 % likely). MAX showed an increase in 10 -m sprint time (0. 04 ± 0. 03 s, ES = 0. 41, 89 % likely), but no other change was found for sprint or jump tests.

40|$|METHODS After a <b>familiarization</b> <b>period,</b> six well-trained males {{participated in}} a diet and {{exercise}} regimen lasting 9 d and comprising three cycling tests to exhaustion. A work rate was selected during the <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> {{that would result in}} fatigue after approximately 90 - 100 min at an ambient temperature of 10 degrees C (i. e., approximately 75 % of VO 2 max). The first exercise test was a depletion trial and was preceded by a period during which the subjects' normal diet was consumed. A prescribed 70 % carbohydrate (CHO) diet was then consumed for 3. 5 d. After this diet, a second exercise test was performed; one of two isoenergetic experimental meals was consumed 4 h before this test (70 % CHO meal, CHO trial; or 90 % fat meal, fat trial). The second exercise test was followed by a further 3. 5 -d period on the high CHO diet. Four hours before the third test, subjects consumed the other meal. Heparin was administered intravenously 30 min (1000 U), 15 min (500 U), and 0 min (500 U) before exercise on the fat trial. Subjects were assigned to the two meals in randomized order. RESULTS Time to exhaustion increased from 118. 2 (12. 4) min on the CHO trial to 127. 9 (12. 1) min on the fat trial (P = 0. 001). Although no difference in VO 2, RER, HR or RPE was found between trials, there was an earlier reduction in RER and an earlier rise in RPE on the fat trial. No difference in total CHO oxidation was found between trials (383 +/- 70 g on the CHO trial and 362 +/- 59 g on the fat trial).

Healthy naı̈ve subjects improve endurance with successive exposures to PTL by altering their breathing responses, thus necessitating a <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> before reproducible measures can be obtained. This study sought {{to determine whether a}} similar “learning effect” is evident in patients with COPD, and what the mechanism of any such effect may be. Methods: Ten subjects with COPD (FEV 1 34 ± 13 % predicted) underwent PTL on four occasions (> 24 h apart). During PTL measurements were obtained of breathing pattern and maximum threshold pressure (Pthmax) achieved. Maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax) was measured on each occasion. Results: Over the four tests PImax improved by 21 ± 16 % (sd) (P< 0. 05) and Pthmax by 32 ± 21 % (P< 0. 05) with a plateau in these measures achieved by test three. Pthmax/PImax was unchanged, being 61 ± 11 % at test one and 67 ± 12 % at test four. In contrast to healthy subjects, PTL was not associated with increased expiratory time or decreased end-expiratory lung volume. Conclusions: In contrast to PImax and Pthmax, which changed with successive tests, a single measure of the ratio Pthmax/PImax may present a useful guide to the endurance capacity of the respiratory muscles in patients with COPD...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 5 years, 1 of every 3 {{deaths in the}} United Stateswas {{attributed}} to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Regular physical activity has numerous benefits associated with the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Despite these details, 60 % of Americans are not regularly physically active and 25 % are not active at all. Previous studies have found significant changes in cardiovascular disease risk fac tors by combining cardiorespiratory and strength training into one exercise program. The current pilot study augments the approach by utilizing a group fitness program that mimics the Physical Activity Guidelines for Fitness. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate if a multimodal group fitness intervention could singularly produce the physiological and musculoskeletal health benefits of the established physical activity prescription. Twenty-five sedentary, but otherwise healthy, adults (15 women and 10 men) {{between the ages of}} 25 - 40 years completed the protocol of a 30 -week group exercise program. It started with a 6 -week <b>familiarization</b> <b>period,</b> continued with a 12 -week block of 6 group fitness classes per week (3 cardiovascular, 2 strength, 1 flexibility), and concluded with a 12 -week block of 7 classes per week (4 cardiovascular, 2 strength, 1 flexibility).

40|$|The {{performance}} and movement efficiency of prosthesis users while traversing a multisectional obstacle course (OC) were evaluated using a crossover design with random allocation of three prosthetic knee joints: the SNS (CaTech; Dayton, Ohio) the C-Leg (Otto Bock; Duderstadt, Germany), and the 3 R 60 (Otto Bock). Twelve users completed the OC twice with each joint, once without and once with a mental loading task (MLT). The performance was objectively assessed using time measurement from digital video recordings, and the Total Heart Beat Index {{was used to}} estimate movement efficiency. A 1 mo <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> was provided for each knee joint before data collection. It took longer to complete the OC with the 3 R 60 compared with either the SNS or the C-Leg. No significant time {{differences were found between}} the C-Leg and the SNS, but differences between the 3 R 60 and the SNS (slalom and rock sections) and between the 3 R 60 and the C-Leg (rock section) were observed. Within the simulated sand section, two participants fell with the C-Leg, one with the 3 R 60, and none with the SNS. Movement efficiency without MLT was similar between all joints, but with an MLT a significant decrease in movement efficiency was observed with the C-Leg. Previous experience using an SNS had no influence on the results...|$|E
40|$|Remerciements : Inra, UMR PRC, Plateforme de Phénotypage - Endocrinologie, 37380 NouzillyIn ewes, the ovulatory {{response}} of females exposed to familiar rams {{is lower than}} the {{response of}} those exposed to novel ones. In goats, males rendered sexually active by exposure to long days are more efficient to induce ovulation in seasonal anestrous females than untreated males. Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether male goats remain familiar to females after 45 days of separation; and 2) whether photostimulated males are able to stimulate the sexual activity of females, independently of their familiarity with them. In experiment 1, three groups of goats (n = 10 goats per group) were put in contact with males (n = 2 per group) during 10 days in November (<b>familiarization</b> <b>period).</b> These males were called familiar males. After 15, 30 and 45 days of separation from the males, females of each group were exposed to familiar or novel males during 10 min. In each test, goats in contact with novel males displayed more distress bleats, escapes, head butts, and sniffing than those in contact with familiar males (P 0. 05). We concluded that after 45 days of separation, males are still familiar to females. The photostimulated males are able to induce the sexual activity of seasonally anestrous goats independently of their familiarity with them...|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} energy expenditure (VO 2) of jumping rope and running. No study {{has examined the}} VO 2 of a divided jumping rope (2 handles with a foot-long rope and a soft ball {{on the end of}} each rope) with and without weights. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine VO 2 using a divided rope with and without weights, jumping at 125 rpm, and running at 7 mph. Methods: Subjects (N = 22, 11 females, 21. 9 ± 3. 2 years, 173. 4 ± 8. 2 cm, 68. 3 ± 11. 0 kg) had a 2 -week <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> of rope jumping and jogging for a total of 10 days. By the end of the 2 weeks, all subjects could do 5 min of continuous jumping. VO 2, heart rate (HR), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were compared for each of the three conditions: (1) jumping with a divided rope, (2) jumping with a divided weighted rope, and (3) running at 7 mph. The order of testing for the three conditions was randomly assigned. An ANOVA was used to detect differences among conditions (p. 05) in HR or RPE across the three conditions. Discussion: The jump rope conditions were similar but both were lower than running at 7 mph. Interestingly, the HR and RPE showed no differences (p 3 ̆e. 05) across conditions...|$|E

Twenty-eight males completed a 4 -week <b>familiarization</b> <b>period</b> and were then counterbalanced on the basis of responsiveness across; non-failure rapid shortening (RS; rapid concentric, 2 [*]s eccentric), non-failure stretch-shortening (SSC; rapid concentric, rapid eccentric), and failure control (C, 2 [*]s concentric, 2 [*]s eccentric), for a 12 -week unilateral elbow flexor resistance training regimen, 3 x week using 85 % of one repetition maximum (1 RM). 1 RM, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and muscle activation (EMGRMS) of the agonist, antagonist, and stabilizer muscles were assessed before and after the 12 -week training period. The average number of repetitions per set was significantly lower in RS 4. 2 [confidence interval (CI) : 4. 2, 4. 3] and SSC 4. 2 (CI: 4. 2, 4. 3) compared with C 6. 1 (CI: 5. 8, 6. 4). A significant increase in 1 RM (30. 5 %), MVC (13. 3 %), CSA (11. 4 %), and agonist EMGRMS (22. 1 %) was observed; however, no between-group differences were detected. In contrast, antagonist EMGRMS increased significantly in SSC (40. 5 %) and C (23. 3 %), but decreased in RS (13. 5 %). Similar adaptations across the three resistance training regimen suggest repetition failure is not critical to elicit significant neural and structural changes to skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if improvements in glucose tolerance could be demonstrated following an acute bout of progressive resistance exercises. Fourteen individuals, not currently weight training, were assigned to two groups using the guidelines established by the WHO for NIDDM and normal (CON), {{based on the results of}} a three hour 75 g (- 1. 2 M) load oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Eight blood samples were collected during the OGTT and assayed for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. Each subject from the NIDDM (n= 7) and CON (n= 7) groups participated in a <b>familiarization</b> <b>period,</b> including a IRM, with eight different Nautilus selectorized exercise machines utilizing both the upper and lower body. A 3 set x 10 repetition exercise protocol based on the IRM was conducted and followed 18 hours later by another OGTT. Two day diets were replicated from the prior OGTT. Analysis of variance failed to demonstrate significant differences in the total responses or at any specific sampling points from pre to postprotocol for glucose (p= 0. 53), C-peptide (p= 0. 07) or the C-peptide:insulin ratio (p= 0. 16) in either group. Blood insulin levels from pre to postprotocol were significantly reduced (p= 0. 001) by 24 % and 22 % for the NIDDM and CON groups, respectively. These data suggest that a single series of progressive resistance exercises improve insulin uptake by the tissues without augmenting glucose disposal. School of Physical EducationThesis (M.

40|$|Fifty-four untreated, mildly {{hypertensive}} {{men whose}} daily alcohol consumption was £ 28 ml ethanol and who drank at least 4 {{times per week}} {{took part in a}} randomized, controlled crossover trial. The purpose of the trial was to test the effects of alcohol reduction on blood pressure. After a 2 -week <b>familiarization</b> <b>period,</b> the participants were assigned to either a reduced alcohol drinking group or a usual drinking group for 3 weeks (experimental period 1). The situation was then reversed for the next 3 weeks (experimental period 2). The participants were requested to limit their daily alcohol consumption to zero or reduce it as much as possible for the reduced alcohol consumption period. The self-reported alcohol consumption was 56. 1 ± 3. 6 (SEM) ml/day during the usual alcohol drinking period and 26. 1 ± 3. 0 ml/day during the period of reduced alcohol consumption. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the intervention group were found by analysis of variance to be significantly lower (2. 6 - 4. 8 and 2. 2 - 3. 0 mm Hg, respectively) than those in the control group during experimental period 2 for systolic blood pressure and experimental period 1 for diastolic blood pressure. Significant (3. 6 mm Hg) and nonsignif-icant (1. 9 mm Hg) decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, were observed. The method of Hills and Armitage was used, reducing ethanol in daily alcohol consumption by 28 ml. The lowering effect of reduced alcohol consumption on blood pressure was independent of changes in sal...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{environmental}} preference chamber (EPC) {{was developed}} and used to assess responses of laboratory mice to atmospheric ammonia. The EPC features 1) a test chamber with 4 individually ventilated, mutually accessible compartments; b) automated tracking of mouse movements by using paired infrared sensors; c) identification of individual mice by using photosensors; d) monitoring and regulation of the NH 3 concentration in each compartment; and e) personal-computer–based data acquisition. In an initial preference study with the EPC, 4 groups of 4 laboratory mice (BALB/c/Bkl; body weight, 13. 4 to 18. 4 g) were each given a choice among 4 NH 3 concentrations (mean ± SE) of 4 ± 2, 30 ± 2, 56 ± 4, and 110 ± 6 ppm for 2 d after a 2 -d <b>familiarization</b> <b>period.</b> Once trained to use the intercompartment tunnels, the mice made extensive use of the EPC, with each group making more than 2000 intercompartment movements during 48 h. Video recording verified {{the results of the}} automatic tracking system, which detected and correctly determined mouse location for 79 % of the moves. The use of photosensors proved to be ineffective in recognizing individual mice. Although the EPC would benefit from refinement and further development, it simplified analysis of locomotion behavioral data. Results of the preference study indicated that the mice exhibited no clear preference for, or aversion to, any of the experimental concentrations of ammonia and that the mice clearly preferred the upper 2 compartments of the chamber over the lower 2 compartments. Further investigation should be conducted to verify these preliminary results and explore other preferences of laboratory mice for environmental conditions and resources...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} processing with nonlinear frequency compression (NLFC) in hearing aids for young children with bilateral hearing loss. Methods: Sixty-four children aged between 2 and 7 years with bilateral hearing aids were recruited. Evaluations of cortical responses, speech intelligibility rating, consonant perception and functional performance were completed with the children wearing their personal hearing aids with conventional processing. The children were then refitted with new hearing aids with NLFC processing. Following a six-week <b>familiarization</b> <b>period,</b> they were evaluated again while using their hearing aids with NLFC activated. Results: The mean speech intelligibility rating and the number of cortical responses present for /s/were significantly higher when children were using NLFC processing than conventional processing in their hearing aids (p < 0. 05). Parents judged the children's functional real life performance with the NLFC hearing aids to be similar or better than that with the children's own hearing aids in both quiet and noisy situations. The mean percent consonant score was higher with NLFC processing compared to conventional processing, but the difference did not reach the 5 % significance level (p = 0. 056). An overall figure of merit (FOM) was calculated by averaging the standardized difference scores between processing schemes for all measures. Regression analysis revealed that, on average, greater advantage for NLFC processing was associated with poorer hearing at 4 kHz. Conclusions: Compared to conventional processing, the use of NLFC was, on average, effective in increasing audibility of /s/as measured by cortical evaluations, and higher ratings on speech intelligibility and functional performance in real life by parents. On average, greater benefits from NLFC processing was associated with poorer hearing at 4 kHz. 9 page(s...|$|E
