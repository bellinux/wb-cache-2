5000|$|... “Black yeasts”, {{sometimes}} also black fungi, dematiaceous fungi, microcolonial fungi or meristematic fungi is {{a diverse}} group of slow-growing microfungi which reproduce mostly asexually (fungi imperfecti). Only few genera reproduce by budding cells, while in others hyphal or meristematic (<b>isodiametric)</b> reproduction is preponderant. Black yeasts share some distinctive characteristics, in particular melanisation of their cell wall. Morphological plasticity, incrustation of the cell wall with melanins and presence of other protective substances like carotenoids and mycosporines represent passive physiological adaptations which enable black fungi to be highly resistant against environmental stresses. The term [...] "polyextremotolerance" [...] has been introduced to describe this phenotype, a good example of which is the species Aureobasidium pullulans. Presence of 1,8-dihydroxynaphtalene melanin in the cell wall confers to the microfungi their characteristic olivaceous to dark brown/black colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} a van Kampen diagram was {{introduced}} by Egbert van Kampen in 1933. This paper appeared {{in the same issue}} of American Journal of Mathematics as another paper of van Kampen, where he proved what is now known as the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The main result of the paper on van Kampen diagrams, now known as the van Kampen lemma can be deduced from the Seifert-van Kampen theorem by applying the latter to the presentation complex of a group. However, van Kampen did not notice it at the time and this fact was only made explicit much later (see, e.g.). Van Kampen diagrams remained an underutilized tool in group theory for about thirty years, until the advent of the small cancellation theory in the 1960s, where van Kampen diagrams play a central role. Currently van Kampen diagrams are a standard tool in geometric group theory. They are used, in particular, for the study of isoperimetric functions in groups, and their various generalizations such as <b>isodiametric</b> functions, filling length functions, and so on.|$|E
50|$|They {{are small}} bundles of sclerenchyma tissue in plants that form durable layers, {{such as the}} cores of apples and the gritty texture of pears (Pyrus communis). Sclereids are {{variable}} in shape. The cells can be <b>isodiametric,</b> prosenchymatic, forked or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within parenchyma tissues. But compared with most fibres, sclereids are relatively short. Characteristic examples are brachysclereids or the stone cells (called stone cells because of their hardness) of pears and quinces (Cydonia oblonga) {{and those of the}} shoot of the wax plant (Hoya carnosa). The cell walls fill nearly all the cell's volume. A layering of the walls and the existence of branched pits is clearly visible. Branched pits such as these are called ramiform pits. The shell of many seeds like those of nuts as well as the stones of drupes like cherries and plums are made up from sclereids.|$|E

In the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group {{equipped}} with its Car-not-Carathéodory metric {{and with a}} Haar measure, we consider <b>isodiametric</b> sets, i. e. sets maximizing the measure among all sets with a given diameter. In particular, given an <b>isodiametric</b> set, and up to negligible sets, we prove that its boundary is given by the graphs of two locally Lipschitz functions.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that D. Cohen’s {{inequality}} bounding the isoperimetric {{function of a}} group by the double exponential of its <b>isodiametric</b> function is valid in the more general context of locally finite simply connected complexes. It is shown that in this context this bound is ‘best possible’. Also studied are seconddimensional isoperimetric functions for groups and complexes. It is shown that the second-dimensional isoperimetric function of a group is bounded by a recursive function. By a similar argument it is shown that the area distortion of a finitely presented subgroup of a finitely presented group is recursive. Cohen’s inequality is extended to second-dimensional isoperimetric and <b>isodiametric</b> functions of 2 -connected simplicial complexes. D. Cohen showed in [3] that the isoperimetric function (also called the Dehn function) of a group is bounded by the double exponential of its <b>isodiametric</b> function.

Cells in the DEZ respond to gravistimulation, mechanical impedance, electrotropic stimulation, water stress, and auxin.

40|$|The edge effect, {{generated}} by the interaction of patch and matrix, is preferably described by the interior-to-edge ratio of the patch.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the response of}} primary roots of maize (Zea mays L. cv Merit) to unilateral application of calcium with {{particular attention to the}} site of application, the dependence on growth rate, and possible contributions of thigmotropic stimulation during application. Unilateral application of agar to the root cap induced negative curvature whether or not the agar contained calcium. This apparent thigmotropic response was enhanced by including calcium in the agar. Curvature away from objects applied unilaterally to the extreme root tip occurred both in intact and detipped roots. When agar containing calcium chloride was applied {{to one side of the}} postmitotic <b>isodiametric</b> growth zone (a region between the apical meristem and the elongation zone), the root curved toward the side of application. This response could not be induced by plain agar. We conclude that curvature away from calcium applied to the root tip results from a thigmotropic response to stimulation during application.

40|$|Background and Aims: Coffee seed {{germination}} represents an interplay between the embryo {{and the surrounding}} endosperm. A sequence of events in both parts of the seed determines whether germination will be successful or not. Following previous studies, the aim here was to further characterize the morphology of endosperm degradation and embryo growth with respect to morphology and cell cycle, {{and the influence of}} abscisic acid on these processes. Methods: Growth of cells in a fixed region of the axis was quantified from light micrographs. Cell cycle events were measured by flow cytometry and by immunocytochemistry, using antibodies against ß-tubulin. Aspects of the endosperm were visualized by light and scanning electron microscopy. Key Results: The embryonic axis cells grew initially by <b>isodiametric</b> expansion. This event coincided with reorientation and increase in abundance of microtubules and with accumulation of ß-tubulin. Radicle protrusion was characterized by a shift from <b>isodiametric</b> expansion to elongation of radicle cells and further accumulation of ß-tubulin. Early cell division events started prior to radicle protrusion. Abscisic acid decreased the abundance of microtubules and inhibited the growth of the embryo cells, the reorganization of the microtubules, DNA replication in the embryonic axis, the formation of a protuberance and the completion of germination. The endosperm cap cells had smaller and thinner cell walls {{than the rest of the}} endosperm. Cells in the endosperm cap displayed compression followed by loss of cell integrity and the appearance of a protuberance prior to radicle protrusion. Conclusions: Coffee {{seed germination}} is the result of <b>isodiametric</b> growth of the embryo followed by elongation, at the expense of integrity of endosperm cap cells. The cell cycle, including cell division, is initiated prior to radicle protrusion. ABA inhibits expansion of the embryo, and hence subsequent events, including germination.
