60|$|But {{when the}} Lion saw him move <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and roared.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} Gr-gr-gr sat in thought. Then <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and {{addressed}} my guard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Proper! It {{would be}} a scandal to the whole diocese. How could <b>he</b> <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as <b>he</b> {{pronounced}} the eighth commandment? That {{must be at least}} prevented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] cried <b>he,</b> <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Let {{there be}} an end of this. And since you are so pleased with his conduct, Miss Vandeleur, take a candle and show the bastard out." ...|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched by {{the sympathy}} in her tone, <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looks gratefully at her: she {{immediately}} draws hack and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers {{are not like}} that. (She {{moves away from the}} ottoman.) ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> from his embroidery--with a sudden {{appearance}} of interest.|$|E
60|$|Finally, however, he {{finished}} the game, and then <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked sharply at his visitors.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} up at her, vacant and wistful, forlorn already, as if the death-parting was over.|$|E
60|$|At Columbine's {{entrance}} <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> drooping <b>head,</b> and so {{removed the}} suggestion of sadness in his posture.|$|R
6000|$|... and therewith the pallor {{reveals a}} man in the void, an incorporeal but visible man, seated, absurdly enough, on nothing. For a moment <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as the music passes him by. Then, with a heavy sigh, he droops in utter dejection; and the violins, discouraged, retrace their melody in despair and at last give it up, {{extinguished}} by wailings from uncanny wind instruments, thus:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly, {{and turns}} {{his eyes to}} mine, and we involuntarily recoil before his look. It is a calm and quiet glance, free from fear, anger, or pain; but it somehow sends the blood {{curdling}} through our veins. He bowed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over <b>his</b> book again, taking no further notice of us. The men look at me compassionately and hold their peace. I make one more effort:-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> took it {{from her}} hand, and looked at it. Soon she saw the tears {{dropping}} over it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and turned}} towards his {{subordinate}} a long, meagre {{face with the}} accentuated features of an energetic Don Quixote.|$|E
6000|$|Gabriel {{dropped his}} eyes, {{but even then}} the frank honesty of his nature spoke for him. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and said simply--"No!" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the result}} of this thought <b>he</b> {{presently}} <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and spoke to Prince Marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> painfully {{towards the}} couch where lay {{stretched}} his late antagonist, [...] "he whom men call the Knight of Ardenvohr?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave the hat," [...] {{said her}} visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she saw <b>he</b> had <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and was sitting {{and looking at}} her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> firmly. His eyes bethought {{themselves}} once more. Witless shellfish swam in {{the gross}} lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.|$|E
6000|$|... "God's light!" [...] said Sakr-el-Bahr, {{and fell}} to musing. Then <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and laughed. [...] "Faith, he's some days late for that!" ...|$|E
60|$|Once more <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{once more}} the light that flickered in his face {{transformed}} him into some semblance of a virile man.|$|E
60|$|The warrior hews {{his way to}} the front, {{and behind}} him rally the disorganized {{soldiers}} of Helium. As <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> aloft to fling a challenge at the men upon the palace walls I see his face, and my heart swells in pride and happiness as the red warriors leap to the side of their leader and win back the ground that they had but just lost--the face of him upon the mighty thoat is the face of my son--Carthoris of Helium.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} <b>head</b> in <b>his</b> mouth. After mating, <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and back and whistles.|$|R
60|$|Cosmo {{is perhaps}} dreaming {{that he is}} back at Osborne, for he calls out, as if in answer to a summons, that he is up and nearly dressed. <b>He</b> then <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and surveys Ginevra.|$|R
60|$|During this {{conversation}} Flannigan had not betrayed the slightest {{interest in what}} was going on. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> now {{and looked at the}} Captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Northman {{never moved}} a muscle. He was {{gazing at the}} floor; he seemed not to have heard. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> after a while.|$|E
60|$|This {{appeal to}} manly {{protection}} was received by Stevie {{with his usual}} docility. It flattered him. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and threw out his chest.|$|E
60|$|With this <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> lean <b>head</b> {{to look up}} at the Tin Owl and the Canary and the Monkey, and he lashed {{his tail}} upon the ground and growled as {{fiercely}} as any jaguar could.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{cares for}} his horse, {{with his own}} hands?" [...] This query {{seemed to be the}} climax of Mr. Gale's strange hunger for truth. <b>He</b> had <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little higher, and his eye was brighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are ignorant," [...] he {{repeated}} thoughtfully. <b>He</b> had <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and was looking}} straight into her face now, while she held his hand. They stood like {{this for a long}} moment. She released his hand.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{being the}} case, I felt {{not a little}} {{surprised}} when <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|So when Elsa {{spoke to}} him and asked him that one {{straight}} and firm question, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and looked straight into her tear-dimmed eyes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sharply, {{and frowned}} toward the blank {{shutters}} of the poulterer's shop where they jutted out against our window. Then one clear line came:-- ...|$|E
50|$|The chambon is used {{mostly in}} {{training}} horses via longeing. The chambon was originally intended for longeing and free schooling. It is advanced equipment {{for use by}} knowledgeable trainers. A chambon is not a way to quickly fix the head set of a horse; its purpose is to help develop the correct muscles. Chambons help a horse to develop the muscles of their back and topline. It applies pressure to the poll and mouth of the horse when <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> releasing when the horse stretches long and low, down toward the ground. When a horse is longed correctly, and the chambon is correctly adjusted, the horse stretches down and <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> back.|$|R
60|$|Just then it {{occurred}} to Tarzan of the Apes that Numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time, so <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> young <b>head</b> toward the heavens, and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid.|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't {{have said}} {{anything}} {{better than what}} you have said just now to make it steady," [...] flowed the murmur of Lingard's voice with something tender in its depth. [...] "Has anybody ever had a friend like this?" [...] <b>he</b> exclaimed, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as if taking the starry night to witness.|$|R
