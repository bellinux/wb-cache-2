5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen are <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th century, recent archaeological finds {{in connection with}} work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed {{the remains of a}} large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century.

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized {{the use of}} quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|Cartoon animal super-heroes were longer-lived. Supermouse and Mighty Mouse were {{published}} continuously {{in their own}} titles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Age through {{the beginning of the}} Silver Age. Atomic Mouse was given his own title in 1953, lasting ten years. Atomic Rabbit, later named Atomic Bunny, was published from 1955 to 1959. In the United Kingdom, the Marvelman series was published during the interregnum between the Golden and Silver Ages, substituting for the British reprints of the Captain Marvel stories after Fawcett stopped publishing the character's adventures.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} of Navenby {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now largely a dormitory village for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.|$|E

5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories {{to the east}} and south of the Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Blökkumen ("Romanians") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians"). Some of the Pechenegs fled into the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{eleventh}} century, universities {{had been}} founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots {{who wished to}} attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students {{have been identified as}} doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orléans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Géza {{married a}} niece of Nikephoros Botaneiates, a close advisor of Emperor Michael VII. However, Solomon still {{controlled}} Moson and Pressburg; the royal troopswhich {{were under the}} command of Géza's brother, Ladislauscould not take Pressburg in 1076. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Géza considered renouncing the crown in favor of Solomon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. Géza died on 15 April 1077 and was buried in the cathedral of Vác, which he had erected in the honor of the Holy Virgin. His brother, Ladislaus succeeded him. A grave discovered {{in the center of the}} medieval cathedral in August 2015 was identified as Géza's burial site by Zoltán Batizi, the leader of the excavations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stewart Dynasty. The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands, and a large number of royal minorities.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern segment at Negaunee along US41/M-28 and US41 to Baraga, {{to connect with the}} northern segment westward to Ontonagon.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SBC {{acquired}} the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), {{which was one}} of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became insolvent by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which had entered the 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war to CHF 4billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10billion by 1965.|$|E

The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, {{in the vicinity of the}} Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E
