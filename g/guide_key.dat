These techniques were: two-incision with the tibial tunnel at the anterior "footprint" of the anterior cruciate ligament (group I), two-incision with freehand placement of the tibial tunnel in the central or posterior "footprint" (group II), and endoscopic single incision utilizing a <b>guide</b> <b>keying</b> on the posterior cruciate ligament to achieve posterior tibial tunnel location (group III). The femoral tunnel was established with a rear-entry guide for the two-incision techniques. A <b>guide</b> <b>keying</b> off the posterior intercondylar shelf or roof was used for femoral tunnel placement with the endoscopic technique. Subjective rating, Lysholm scores, range of motion, manual and instrumented laxity, and radiographic tibial and femoral tunnel location in the sagittal plane were studied for 33 patients (twelve in group I, nine in group II, twelve in group III) at minimum follow-up of two years.

We give {{an account}} on Otto’s {{geometrical}} heuristics for realizing, on a compact Riemannian manifold M, the L 2 Wasserstein distance restricted to smooth positive probability measures, as a Riemannian distance. The Hilbertian metric dis-covered by Otto is obtained as the base metric of a Riemannian submersion with total space, the group of diffeomorphisms of M equipped with the Arnol’d metric, and projection, the push-forward of a reference probability measure. The expression of the horizontal constant speed geodesics (time dependent optimal mass transporta-tion maps) is derived using the Riemannian geometry of M as a <b>guide.</b> <b>Key</b> words: optimal mass transportation; rearrangement of diffeomorphisms; Hilber-tian manifold; Helmholtz splittings; Riemannian submersion; horizontal geodesics...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{light of}} the {{emerging}} obesity pandemic, front-of-pack calories labels {{may be an important}} tool to assist consumers in making informed healthier food choices.

The present study aimed at providing more insight into consumers ’ appreciation of front-ofpack labelling of caloric content of food products and their specific preferences for alternative execution formats for such information in Europe. Design: For this purpose, eight executions of front-of-pack calorie flags were designed and their appeal and information value were extensively discussed with consumers through qualitative research in four different countries (Germany, The Netherlands, France and the UK) ...|$|E
40|$|At Microsoft we use {{a number}} of static {{analysis}} tools {{to ensure the quality}} of the code we produce. Over several years, we have solved problems associated with deploying these tools in a large development environment, including problems of performance, policies for using tools, and methods for encouraging their usage. One challenge is getting appropriate feedback from users about the effectiveness of these methods. In particular, we do not get feedback about errors and warnings that are found and resolved on the desktop and do not make it into the code repository. To address this problem, we have developed an instrumentation framework called ATMetrics, which allows us to collect usage metrics that we can use to analyze how static analysis tools are used in the field.

40|$|Abstract: Venous {{thrombosis}} {{development is}} the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the cases with carcinoma. Besides prevention and treatment of the disease, studies clarifying pathophysiology are required in clinical studies. It is possible to research the initiating factors of forming thrombus in two groups; intravenous and extravenous. Intravenous factors: tissue factors, carcinoma procoagulant, TNF secreted from carcerous cells, IL 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor, mucin, thrombomodulus, ADP, heparin sulphat, annexing II can be considered. Extravenous factors are the size of cancerous mass, histopathologic diagnoses, the pressure it causes, vascular wall damage, venous stasis, lengthened immobilization, chemotherapy and surgical interventions. By supporting these factors that contribute to forming thrombosis in the cancer patients with the literature data, treatment choices against the risk of thrombosis will be suggested with the help of <b>guides.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Cancer Thrombosis Deep venous thrombosis Venous thromboembolys...|$|R

40|$|Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) {{and their}} ‘diced ’ small RNA {{products}} can <b>guide</b> <b>key</b> developmental and defense mechanisms in eukaryotes. Some RNA-directed mechanisms act at a post-transcriptional level to degrade target messenger RNAs. However, dsRNA-derived species can also direct {{changes in the}} chromatin structure of DNA regions with which they share sequence identity. For example, plants use such RNA species to lay down cytosine methylation imprints on identical DNA sequences, providing a fundamental mark {{for the formation of}} transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Thus, RNA can feed backwards to modulate the accessibility of information stored in the DNA of cognate genes. RNA triggers for DNA methylation can come from different sources, including invasive viral, transgene or transposon sequences, and in some cases are derived from single-stranded RNA precursors by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The mechanism by which RNA signals are translated into DNA methylation imprints is currently unknown, but two plantspecific types of cytosine methyltransferase have been implicated in this process. RNA can also direct heterochromatin formation in fission yeast and Drosophila, but in these organisms the process occurs in the absence of DNA methylation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{reducing}} the interactive latency of image processing computations in visual effects. Film and television graphic artists depend upon low-latency feedback to receive a visual response to changes in effect parameters. We tackle latency with a domain-specific optimising compiler which leverages high-level program metadata to <b>guide</b> <b>key</b> computational and memory hierarchy optimisations. This metadata encodes static and dynamic information about data dependence and patterns of memory access in the algorithms constituting a visual effect – features that are typically difficult to extract through program analysis – and presents it to the compiler in an explicit form. By using domain-specific information {{as a substitute for}} program analysis, our compiler is able to target a set of complex source-level optimisations that a vendor compiler does not attempt, before passing the optimised source to the vendor compiler for lower-level optimisation. Three key metadata-supported optimisations are presented. The first is an adaptation of space and schedule optimisation – based upon well-known compositions of the loop fusion and array contraction transformations – to the dynamic working sets and schedules of a runtimeparameterise...|$|E

Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} safety and attendant issues concerning glass façades, glass roofs and canopies, and glass barriers that protect a drop. Information is provided on glass manufacture and processing, the types, strength and breakage behaviour of glazing infill materials and glazing systems, the parties involved in the building life cycle, and the performance of glazing and its associated risks. Additional sections summarise existing glazing advice within the UK and consider the use of risk assessments in decision-making (including worked examples of glazing risk assessments). The guide will be of value to the broadest spectrum of “designers” - clients, architects, engineers, specifiers, main contractors and specialist sub-contractors - involved in the use of glass in buildings.
