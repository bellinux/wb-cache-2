25|$|In 2010, former defence {{minister}} Juan Manuel Santos {{was elected president}} with Uribe's support and on the general promise to continue consolidating Uribe's <b>democratic</b> <b>security</b> policies.

25|$|Álvaro Uribe was reelected in a {{landslide}} in 2006, and made the 'consolidation' of <b>democratic</b> <b>security</b> one of his major priorities for the second term. Between 2006 and 2010, the military struck significant blows to the FARC, {{and for the first}} time successfully targeted high-ranking members of the FARC's Secretariat. In March 2008, Raúl Reyes was killed in a cross-border operation in Ecuador (which sparked a major diplomatic crisis), followed in May 2008 by the natural death of the FARC's historic leader Manuel Marulanda. In the midst of military blows, the FARC sought to maintain the political initiative by promoting a humanitarian exchange, and President Uribe bowed to public pressure in August 2007 by agreeing to discussions mediated by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In November 2007, however, Uribe ended Chávez's mediation. Henceforth, the liberation of hostages came through unilateral decisions by the FARC (Operation Emmanuel) with Venezuelan mediation or military rescue operations (Operation Jaque).|$|E

2500|$|Widespread popular {{frustration}} and disillusion {{with the peace}} process led to the election of Álvaro Uribe in May 2002, on a hawkish platform opposing any future dialogue without a prior cessation of hostilities and terrorist activities. As president, Uribe formalized these views in his policy of <b>democratic</b> <b>security</b> (seguridad democrática), which redefined the conflict against the left-wing guerrillas as a war against terrorism and drug trafficking and vowed to [...] "implacably punish" [...] acts of terror, dismantle terrorist organizations and reassert the State's presence throughout the territory. As companion policies, Uribe adopted several individual and collective demobilization programs, promising pardons for political crimes and humanitarian assistance to fighters who submitted to its conditions. These decrees and laws, alongside the contentious Justice and Peace Law (2005), formed the legal basis for the demobilization of paramilitary groups between 2003 and 2006.|$|E
