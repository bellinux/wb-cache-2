In August 2017, amid racial tension, the Red Sox organization began advocating {{for the city to}} change the street's name.

5|$|Although {{the case}} was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States Supreme Court cases were decided which determined {{the constitutionality of}} New Deal measures, one of which originated in the Eastern District of Missouri.

The Supreme Court upheld {{the determination of the}} trial court judge, Charles Breckenridge Faris, who found that Congress had the power to prohibit parties from contracting for payment in gold.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, {{the council}} allowed the Barber Surgeons {{to build their}} hall {{just east of the}} site: this {{agreement}} was given on 15 March 1647. In 1648, the plot of land was leased to the barber surgeons on condition that they constructed their hall within two years and that part of the site was to be laid out as a garden for medicinal herbs. A second hall built in 1730 disappeared under the railway viaduct in the 1840s. The most aged claimants were preferred for placements at the Hospital and on 22 March 1779, the Mayor and common council of Newcastle ordered that several candidates produce certificates to prove their respective ages, to be <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town-clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before the filing deadline, Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's cross-filing system.

Under cross-filing, if the same candidate won both major party endorsements, he would be effectively elected, with only minor party candidates to stand against him. Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E
5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to the parent company violated the beverage contracts between various parties.

In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E

5|$|A PIL was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Karnataka High Court {{where in}} the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple {{times in the past}} and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E
5|$|In North Chennai area, {{residents}} staged {{protests and}} criticised {{the state government}} for its lack of any rescue response in their locality.

Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort coordination, a public-interest litigation petition was <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Madras High Court; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to suo moto proceedings.

5|$|The peace did not last. Miners began {{prospecting}} {{for gold}} in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1851 {{at the site of}} what later became Jacksonville. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries {{on the south side of}} the main stem. At about the same time, more white emigrants, including women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28donation land claims had been <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rogue Valley. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with the Rogue River (1853) that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854–55, culminating in the Rogue River War of 1855–56.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief <b>filed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
