The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E

And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elder's {{political}} views are philosophically libertarian and {{have also been}} described as conservative. He supports free trade, school choice, and same-sex marriage. He opposes the income tax and supports replacing it with the FairTax, a national retail sales tax. He is also a firm opponent {{of the war on}} drugs and has been quoted as saying: [...] "Philosophically, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> somebody wants to sit around and get stoned that's up to him or her. And if that ruins your life, so be it.... So I am for drug legalization." [...] Although he is not an Objectivist, he says that Atlas Shrugged, written by novelist Ayn Rand, is one of his favorite books.|$|E

2500|$|When {{warned of}} {{potential}} domination by a Stalin dictatorship over part of Europe, Roosevelt {{responded with a}} statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin: [...] "I just have a hunch that Stalin is {{not that kind of}} a man[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace." [...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E

They are also good students. I am really putting an emphasis on guys who can be successful in life, and who have goals that they want to achieve... We have 15 local-area players. There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never going to get all of them. We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{increasing}} anti-war protest, President John Hannah departed MSU in 1969 to {{head the}} United States Agency for International Development—the successor to the International Cooperation Administration that had initiated the MSUG contract. Although his abrupt departure from MSU might suggest otherwise, Hannah did not doubt the project's propriety; years later, he stated, [...] "We never felt any need for the University to apologize... for what {{we tried to do}} in Vietnam. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Michigan State were to face the same choice again in the same context, it might well agree to assist the U.S. Government as we did then." [...] Hannah's interim replacement as president was economics professor Walter Adams, who had long questioned the efficacy of university technical assistance programs and who in 1961 had encouraged Jaffe and Taylor to publish [...] "A Crumbling Bastion".|$|E

2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E

'Well, there <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> you do them, as a class, a great injustice,' said Ernest, quietly; 'you're evidently prejudiced {{against your}} own people. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there's any subject on which our old {{families}} really do know anything, it's art.
