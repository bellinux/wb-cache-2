LMC ceased production in 2000. Thiokol's Imp, Super-Imp and Spryte were most its popular products were continued, in improved versions, by DMC and LMC. Many of these models are still in use today in the commercial market and are popular with as privately owned snowcats. Bombardier of Canada built very popular B12 and C18 Snow coaches, with over 3000 units produced. These units were fast and held up to 18 passengers, but were not suitable for mountain use. Bombardier remains in business manufacturing snowmobiles, personal watercraft, ATVs, and jet airplanes, but no longer produces snowcats. Tucker Sno-Cat continues to manufacture snowcats and other specialty vehicles and is widely used in polar regions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a very high}} gain step up DC-DC {{converter}} is proposed. Maximum voltage gain in conventional boost converter like, switched inductor converter, switched capacitor converter, cascaded boost converter etc. are limited due to <b>extreme</b> <b>duty</b> cycle (i. e. duty cycle near to unity). Operation at <b>extreme</b> <b>duty</b> cycle leads to, serious reverse recovery problem at the switches, high conduction losses, high electromagnetic interference etc. Isolated converter such as fly-back converter, push-pull converter, forward converter, bridge converters etc. overcomes the above issues, where basically a transformer or coupled inductor is used to boost the voltage. But, inclusion of transformer or coupled inductor introduces voltage spike at the main switch and power loss due to leakage inductance. Recently, DC micro-grid gets major importance because of the significant increase in DC loads and demand of high quality power. These DC loads require different voltage levels based on their power ratings. Photo voltaic source (PV) {{is one of the}} prime source of energy in DC micro-grid. A very high voltage gain converter is necessary for DC micro-grid because of low PV source voltage. In this regard, here a step up DC-DC converter is proposed, which possess a very high voltage gain characteristic. Along with this, it provides the additional advantage of supplying power to two different loads (i. e. one for high voltage level and another for low voltage level), which makes it more suitable for DC micro-grid application. Steady state analysis and PWM control of the proposed converter are described in this paper.

40|$|Abstract- A high step-up {{converter}} {{is proposed}} for a photovoltaic system. A voltage multiplier used here provides high voltage gain without <b>extreme</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. The voltage multiplier {{is composed of}} a conventional boost converter and coupled inductors. An extra conventional boost converter is integrated into the first phase to achieve a considerably higher voltage conversion ratio. The two-phase configuration not only reduces the current stress through each power switch, but also constrains the input current ripple, which decreases the conduction losses of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). It also functions as a clamp circuit which alleviates the voltage spikes across the power switches. So, the low-voltage-rated MOSFETs can be adopted for reductions of conduction losses and cost. Efficiency improves because the energy stored in leakage inductances is recycled to the output terminal.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{applications}} {{call for}} high step-up dc–dc converters {{that do not}} require isolation. Some dc–dc converters can provide high step-up voltage gain, but with the penalty of either an <b>extreme</b> <b>duty</b> ratio or a large amount of circulating energy. DC–DC converters with coupled inductors can provide high voltage gain, but their efficiency is degraded by the losses associated with leakage inductors. Converters with active clamps recycle the leakage energy at the price of increasing topology com-plexity. A family of high-efficiency, high step-up dc–dc converters with simple topologies is proposed in this paper. The proposed converters, which use diodes and coupled windings instead of active switches to realize functions similar to those of active clamps, perform better than their active-clamp counterparts. High efficiency is achieved because the leakage energy is recycled and the output rectifier reverse-recovery problem is alleviated.

30|$|An {{advanced}} non-isolated stack bidirectional DC-DC converter {{is proposed}} in [30], {{which has a}} high step-up/step-down conversion ratios. This converter is controlled by an optimized PWM method, which is divided into forward and reverse modes according to the power flow. Seamless mode change is realized by introducing an intermediate switching pattern. However, the PWM plus phase-shift control (PPS) control scheme, which is widely adopted in the isolated converters [31, 32, 33], can be employed in this non-isolated stack converter to improve the circuit performance. The duty cycle and phase shift angle of the PPS control strategy can not only balance the voltage of {{the high and low}} voltage side sources, but also regulate the power flow independently and smoothly, which eliminates the requirement of switching pattern change. Furthermore, due to the stack structure and PPS control method, the voltage stress of power switches is reduced to half of the high-side voltage and the <b>extreme</b> <b>duty</b> cycle operation is avoided in high step-up/step-down conversion systems. Moreover, ZVS soft switching operation is achieved for all the power switches without any additional active or passive components.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were to evaluate in practice workload, fitness {{and welfare of}} riding horses under work and training conditions. Chapter II presents {{an overview of the}} parameters used in earlier studies on training, behaviour and equine welfare, and describes the evaluation of the physiological and behavioural responses of horses in field work. Chapter III describes a study on the fitness and responses to training of young Friesian horses. The fitness of horses appeared to improve but there was wide heterogeneity in responses to training. A familial aggregation of heart rate (HR) response to training was identified in horses for the first time. Chapter IV describes a study monitoring the complete national selection of event horses and ponies during preparation for the European Championships in 2010 and 2011. Fitnessassessment provided a useful way to predict the potential risk of injury, since ‘good performers’ were less likely to get injured than ‘average performers’ and HR measured during conditioning training had predictive value for impending injury. Chapter V presents a study on riding school horses, which were monitored for their fitness, workload and the causes of temporary training breaks and premature training terminations. Untrained horses sustained injuries earlier in the training period than trained horses. Horses which were not given time off in response to minor injuries, were more likely to end the training period prematurely than horses that were immediately given a few days off. Chapter VI describes a study on the behavioural and physiological responses of horses encountering challenging objects with three different riders. ‘Matching’ horse-rider combinations exhibited less stress than ‘mismatch’ horse-rider combinations. HR was also a valuable tool for assessing the compliance of horses. Chapter VII reveals that experience is not a key factor in how police-horses handle stress. Horses showed almost no stress during the police-training tests. Since three of these tests reflected normal police work, the findings suggested that this type of work has no significant or detectable negative impact on the horse’s welfare. Chapter VIII demonstrates that during <b>extreme</b> <b>duties,</b> such as riot control training and night patrols the workload and stress of police-horses, were low and were again unlikely to cause behavioural problems and wastage. However, the rider’s control over an individual horse’s fear responses proved to be important in the stress that police-horses experience during challenging situations. Chapter IX describes a study on the stress that horses experience during air transport. HRs during air transport, were lower than those reported in studies on road transport. This supports the concept that air transport is probably more comfortable and less stressful for horses than road transport. Chapter X reviews the different methods used to evaluate the fitness of Warmblood sporthorses under field conditions. For event and dressage horses several types of exercise tests have been developed, but there are no validated methods for show jumping horses. In event horses, VLA 4 is related to performance and impending injury. In riding horses, fitness level was also an important determinant for the occurrence of injuries...|$|R
