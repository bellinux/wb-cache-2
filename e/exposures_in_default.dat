40|$|We combine {{survey data}} from {{retirement}} plan members with information from interviews with plan executives to get both perspectives on who accepts the default plan and default investment option and why. We use a natural experiment <b>in</b> <b>default</b> construction where a new regulatory framework required providers to have stipulated <b>default</b> settings <b>in</b> place by early 2014. We find {{that not all}} retirement savings plan members who default at the plan choice stage default at the investment choice stage, and vice versa. Only around {{one third of the}} sample say they defaulted twice. While some plan executives describe defaulting members as uninterested in their retirement savings, our results highlight that subjective lack of skill combined with trust in the managing agents are the prime motivations for defaulting, rather than low interest. Plan executives set a high risk <b>exposure</b> <b>in</b> <b>default</b> investment strategies to ensure high wealth growth, but defaulting respondents show a lower appetite for risk than active choosers. The heterogeneity and low skill of members make a case for smart defaults...|$|R
40|$|The Basel II Advanced Internal Ratings (AIRB) {{approach}} {{is compared to}} capital requirements set using an equilibrium structural credit risk model. Analysis shows the AIRB approach undercapitalizes credit risk relative to regulatory targets and allows wide variation in capital requirements for a given exposure owing to ambiguity in the definitions of loss given default and <b>exposure</b> at <b>default.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the Foundation Internal Ratings Based (FIRB) approach may over-capitalize credit risk relative to supervisory objectives. It is unclear how Basel II will buttress financial sector stability as it specifies the weakest risk regulatory capital standard for large complex AIRB banks. ...|$|R
50|$|Under F-IRB, EAD is {{calculated}} taking {{account of the}} underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. ignores Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques {{with the exception of}} on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included <b>in</b> <b>Exposure</b> At <b>Default).</b> For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of exposure. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions. For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts.|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a new panel {{data set}} {{of credit card}} {{accounts}} to analyze credit card delinquency, personal bankruptcy, and the stability of credit risk models. We estimate duration models for default and assess {{the relative importance of}} different variables <b>in</b> predicting <b>default.</b> We investigate how the propensity to default has changed over time, disentangling the two leading explanations for the recent increase <b>in</b> <b>default</b> rates - a deterioration in the risk - composition of borrowers versus an increase in borrowers' willingness to default due to declines <b>in</b> <b>default</b> costs, including social, information, and legal costs. Even after controlling for risk-composition and other economic fundamentals, the propensity to default significantly increased between 1995 and 1997. By contrast, increases in credit limits and other changes in risk-composition explain {{only a small part of}} the change <b>in</b> <b>default</b> rates.

40|$|Global {{economic}} crises appear to strongly affect corporate bankruptcy rates. However, several prior {{studies indicate that}} changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk are strongly negatively related to equity returns, which in turn depend predominately on country-specific factors. This suggests that country effects – and not global effects – should dominate changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk. To analyse this issue, we decompose changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk, changes <b>in</b> the fundamental determinants of default risk and equity returns into global, country and industry effects. We proxy for default risk through Merton (1974) default risk estimates and CDS rates. Our evidence reveals that changes <b>in</b> <b>default</b> risk always depend most strongly on global and industry effects. However, the magnitude of country effects in equity returns correlates positively with economic stability, rendering it dependent on the sample period. Our results have implications {{for the management of}} credit-sensitive securities...|$|R
