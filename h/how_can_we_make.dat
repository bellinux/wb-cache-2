First of all, we can make sure that the parents of these {{children}} keep them in school until their preferred level (college, university, etc.). They also need to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E

2500|$|While a {{complete}} theory along this line {{has not been}} developed, entertaining and developing this hypothesis led scholars to interesting speculation and fruitful intuitions on <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> sense of our world within a discrete framework. Marvin Minsky, the AI pioneer, investigated how to understand particle interaction with a four-dimensional CA lattice; Konrad Zuse—the inventor of the first working computer, the Z3—developed an irregularly organized lattice {{to address the question}} of the information content of particles. More recently, Edward Fredkin exposed what he terms the [...] "finite nature hypothesis", i.e., the idea that [...] "ultimately every quantity of physics, including space and time, {{will turn out to be}} discrete and finite." [...] Fredkin and Wolfram are strong proponents of a CA-based physics. In 2016 Gerard 't Hooft published a book long development of the idea to rebuild quantum mechanics using cellular automata.|$|E

6000|$|This, therefore, is {{our first}} {{requirement}} about the ideal towards which progress is directed; it must be fixed. Whistler used to make many rapid studies of a sitter; {{it did not matter}} if he tore up twenty portraits. But it would matter if he looked up twenty times, and each time saw a new person sitting placidly for his portrait. So it does not matter (comparatively speaking) how often humanity fails to imitate its ideal; for then all its old failures are fruitful. But it does frightfully matter how often humanity changes its ideal; for then all its old failures are fruitless. The question therefore becomes this: How can we keep the artist discontented with his pictures while preventing him from being vitally discontented with his art? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a man always dissatisfied with his work, yet always satisfied with working? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> sure that the portrait painter will throw the portrait out of window instead of taking the natural and more human course of throwing the sitter out of window? ...|$|E

This comparison of the secondary sexual characters which lie latent in both sexes, with other latent characters, is the more appropriate from the case recorded of a Hen, which assumed some of the masculine characters, not of her own race, but of an early progenitor; she thus exhibited {{at the same time the}} redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds. In every living creature we may feel assured that a host of long-lost characters lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> intelligible and connect with other facts, this wonderful and common capacity of reversion,--this power of calling back to life long-lost characters? ...|$|E

6000|$|I do not {{see that}} any genuine {{realization}} of the hopes with which {{all this talk about}} the League of Nations is charged can be possible, unless the two bodies which should naturally lead up to the League of Nations--that is to say, firstly, the Conference of the Allies, and then the Peace Congress--are elected bodies, speaking confidently for the whole mass of the peoples behind them. It may be a troublesome thing to elect them, but it will involve much more troublesome consequences if they are not elected. This, I think, is one of the considerations for which many people's minds are still unprepared. But unless we are to have over again after all this bloodshed and effort some such [...] "Peace with Honour" [...] foolery as we had performed by [...] "Dizzy" [...] and Salisbury at that fatal Berlin Conference in which this present war was begotten, we must sit up to this novel proposal of electoral representation in the peace negotiations. Something more than common sense binds our statesmen to this idea. They are morally pledged to it. President Wilson and our British and French spokesmen alike have said {{over and over again that}} they want to deal not with the Hohenzollerns but with the German people. In other words, we have demanded elected representatives from the German people with whom we may deal, and <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a demand of that sort unless we on our part are already prepared to send our own elected representatives to meet them? It is up to us to indicate by our own practice how we on our side, professing as we do to act for democracies, to make democracy safe on the earth, and so on, intend to meet this new occasion.|$|E
60|$|After I had {{successively}} {{studied in}} the schools of Locke, Berkeley, Leibnitz, and Hartley, and could find in none of them an abiding place for my reason, I began to ask myself; is a system of philosophy; as different from mere history and historic classification, possible? If possible, what are its necessary conditions? I was for a while disposed to answer the first question in the negative, and {{to admit that the}} sole practicable employment for the human mind was to observe, to collect, and to classify. But I soon felt, that human nature itself fought up against this wilful resignation of intellect; and as soon did I find, that the scheme, taken with all its consequences and cleared of all inconsistencies, was not less impracticable than contranatural. Assume in its full extent the position, nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu, assume it without Leibnitz's qualifying praeter ipsum intellectum, and in the same sense, in which the position was understood by Hartley and Condillac: and then what Hume had demonstratively deduced from this concession concerning cause and effect, will apply with equal and crushing force to all the other eleven categorical forms [27], and the logical functions corresponding to them. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> bricks without straw;--or build without cement? We learn all things indeed by occasion of experience; but the very facts so learned force us inward on the antecedents, that must be presupposed in order to render experience itself possible. The first book of Locke's Essay, (if the supposed error, which it labours to subvert, be not a mere thing of straw, an absurdity which, no man ever did, or indeed ever could, believe,) is formed on a sophisma heterozaetaeseos, and involves the old mistake of Cum hoc: ergo, propter hoc.|$|E
