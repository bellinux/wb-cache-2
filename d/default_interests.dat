40|$|Summary: Contractual {{penalty and}} <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> under the Czech Commercial code The purpose of my thesis is to analyze {{contractual}} penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> {{pursuant to the}} Commercial Code of Czech Republic. The paper gives {{a detailed description of}} the current legislation as well as a draft of the present Commercial Code of Czech Republic on the concerned subject matter. Moreover, it outlines the foreign legislation and a historical evolution of contractual penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest.</b> The thesis presents in a concise form the relevant Czech case law, in particular the decisions issued by the Supreme Court. The thesis is composed of eight main chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of contractual penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest.</b> Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology, which is used in the thesis. Furthermore, it analyzes the purpose of contractual penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest,</b> legislation in force, the historical evolution of legislation and the foreign legislation involved. Chapter Two examines an agreement on contractual penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest,</b> its alternation and a simultaneous agreement on contractual penalty and <b>default</b> <b>interest.</b> Chapter Three focuses on a duty to be secured.

50|$|The {{court held}} that as the damages claimed by GFA were in excess of {{what they would have}} {{received}} from the lease had it gone the full five years, and ruled that the default clause was not liquidated damages, but instead were penal in nature, and accordingly GFA’s damages claim here was not legally enforceable. As GFA were effectively claiming 2 lots of interest for the same period, one lot of interest contained in the remaining lease payments, and a second a <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> of 32%, meant that the <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> was not enforceable in the first place, not requiring the court to consider whether the rate of 32% was excessive.|$|R

50|$|Mohammed Aziz was a {{resident}} in Spain. He {{took out a}} mortgage with Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya (the Savings Bank of Catalonia), secured on his home at an annual <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> rate of 18.75%. The Caixa was entitled to call in the loan upon a default by Aziz. Clause 15 of the contract also purported to give the right to reclaim any debt, quantifiable immediately. Aziz did default, and the Caixa quantified the debt through a notary, adding contractual and <b>default</b> <b>interest.</b> The bank began repossession of the property and a week before eviction, Aziz applied to the Spanish court to annul clause 15 on grounds of unfairness under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive. No provision in Spanish law foresaw this possibility, nor was there any interim relief. Under Spanish law, final vesting of the mortgaged property was irreversible even if a term was challenged as unfair before the court. The only exception was where a consumer made preliminary registration for the application to be annulled before a marginal note regarding a security certificate.|$|R

Empirical evidence indicates that in most cases duration for defaultable bonds is much shorter than for their default-free counterparts because of the negative relation between <b>default</b> risk and <b>interest</b> rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how {{ownership}} of the firm by its customers, as well as nonprofit status, can prevent the firm from exploiting consumer biases. By eliminating an outside residual claimant with control over the firm, these alternatives to investor ownership reduce the incentive of the firm to offer contractual terms that exploit the mistakes consumers make. However, customers who are unaware of their behavioral biases, and consequent vulnerability to exploitation, may fail to recognize this advantage of non-investor-owned firms and instead continue to patronize investor-owned firms. We present evidence from the consumer financial services market that supports our theory. Comparing contract terms, we find that mutually owned firms offer lower penalties, such as <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and higher up-front prices, such as introductory interest rates, than do investor-owned firms. However, consumers most vulnerable to these penalties are {{no more likely to}} use mutually owned firms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} framework to analyze the impacts of credit and technology shocks on business cycle dynamics, where firms rely on banks and households for capital financing. Firms are identical ex ante but differ ex post due to different realizations of firm specific technology shocks, possible leading to default by some firms. The paper advances a new modelling approach {{for the analysis of}} financial intermediation and firm defaults that takes account of the financial implications of such defaults for both households and banks. Results from a calibrated version of the model highlight the role of financial institutions in the transmission of credit and technology shocks to the real economy. A positive credit shock, defined as a rise in the loan to deposit ratio, increases output, consumption, hours and productivity, and reduces the spread between loan and deposit rates. The effects of the credit shock tend to be highly persistent even without price rigidities and habit persistence in consumption behaviour. bank credit, financial intermediation, firm heterogeneity and <b>defaults,</b> <b>interest</b> rate spread, real financial linkages...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the choice between local and foreign currency debt by firms facing exchange rate risk and hedging possibilities in small open economies. The model shows that the currency composition of debt and the optimal level of hedging are both endogenously determined as optimal firms’ responses to a tradeoff between the lower cost of borrowing in foreign debt and the higher risk involved due to exchange rate uncertainty. Both debt composition and hedging depend on common factors such as foreign exchange risk and financial <b>default,</b> <b>interest</b> rates, the size of net worth and costs of exchange rate risk management. Results of the model are broadly consistent with lending and hedging behavior of the corporate sector in small open economies recently hit by a currency crisis.
