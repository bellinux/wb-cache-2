5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player {{will be put}} in a perilous situation, where they will be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. <b>During</b> <b>one</b> of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated <b>during</b> <b>one</b> of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E

The second is the share of inmates released <b>during</b> <b>one's</b> first year as homeless, which a¤ects the supply of criminal friends.
