5|$|The {{book was}} {{discussed}} {{in a group}} session at the American Philosophical Association's 2002 annual meeting. The panel, led by James Dwyer, included William Galston, Fran Schrag, Yuli Tamir, and a response <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Allah jang Palsoe was {{released}} by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919. This edition included a foreword <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline {{of the state of}} the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the Lontar Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{begins with}} a note <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> which is an {{integral}} part of it. Unusually, the note describes entirely fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the book's main themes: the relativity of truth.|$|E
25|$|He {{had another}} good role in Monte Walsh (1970), <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of Shane, {{opposite}} Lee Marvin, {{but the film}} was a box office disappointment. So too was The Horsemen (1971) with Sharif, directed by John Frankenheimer.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, {{publishers}} {{bought the}} copyright {{in a work}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> and made some arrangement about the possible profits. This required {{a substantial amount of}} capital in addition to that needed for the physical equipment and staff. Alternatively, an author with some capital available would sometimes keep the copyright himself, and simply pay the printer to print the book.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 in the U.S., {{the book}} was reprinted as a Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition, with a brief {{introductory}} note <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> and “with changes that downplayed the novel’s erotic charge.” In 2000, TriQuarterly Books (Northwestern University Press) printed the original version, as a Fiftieth Anniversary Edition, with an afterword by Reginald Gibbons, former editor of TriQuarterly magazine and Goyen scholar.|$|E
25|$|Another {{well-known}} example {{comes from}} the work of Siegfried Sassoon. In 1928, Sassoon, by then a famed war poet, published Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man, the first volume of his George Sherston trilogy. The book, ostensibly a novel, is in effect a lyrical love-letter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> to his vanished Edwardian childhood, set in the dreamy English countryside. The Butley flower show match is a classic evocation of cricket on the village green.|$|E

25|$|In the Nineties, the Romancière {{had created}} a new hero, Venetian Prince, Aldo Morosini a kind of Simon Templar, his “Highness Aldo Morosini” expert on {{historic}} precious stones. The origination of the Aldo Morosini Novels is unique, as we learn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> herself in her foreword in the Novel Les Treize Vents (English: The thirteen Winds). She was asked by a famous French actor to write a script for an adventure story for a television series, {{with him in the}} leading role. The only condition he made: it should play in modern times and in Venice.|$|E
25|$|Man Talk, Woman Talk is humorous, as quintessential comedies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> can be. He {{makes use}} of wry humour to seek a level playing ground for {{resolution}} of the biases men and women nurse about one another and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There {{is a great deal}} of wit in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic.|$|E
25|$|Despite this evidence, the {{surviving}} Hittite texts {{do not provide}} an independent account of the Trojan War. The Manapa-Tarhunda letter is about {{a member of the}} Hittite ruling family, Piyama-Radu, who gained control of the kingdom of Wilusa, and whose only serious opposition came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of this letter, Manapa-Tarhunda. King Muwatalli of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, and the result of Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in {{the surviving}} texts. The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the Achaean Greeks, are mentioned in the Tawagalawa letter as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu. The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa.|$|E

25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, , , , depict Jesus as {{presiding over}} the Last Supper. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical; but Luke's Gospel presents a textual problem in that a few manuscripts omit {{the second half of}} verse 19 and all of v.20 ("given for you … poured out for you"), which are found {{in the vast majority of}} ancient witnesses to the text. If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the third gospel then his version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper, particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's Perestroika {{also had}} repercussions on the {{copyright}} law. From 1987 to 1990, {{a number of}} decrees modified the legislation on copyright and related areas. New remuneration rates that defined much higher royalties than the previous schedules were issued in 1987; the decreasing scales were given {{up at the same}} time: the royalties for all subsequent printings of a work were defined uniformly to amount to 70% of the rates for the first publication. Important changes occurred two years later, when the monopoly of the VAAP on foreign trade in copyrights was broken. Authors henceforth could negotiate directly with foreign publishers; and even the clause in the mandatory model contracts for publication that assigned this right <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> to his publisher was abolished. Likewise, Soviet publishers were free to negotiate with foreign authors or publishers licenses to publish foreign works in the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Benson {{believes}} {{the details of}} Hemingway's life have become a [...] "prime vehicle for exploitation", resulting in a Hemingway industry. Hemingway scholar Hallengren {{believes the}} [...] "hard boiled style" [...] and the machismo must be separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> himself. Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J. D. Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio. During World WarII, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence. [...] In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks [...] "had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war" [...] and jokingly [...] "named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first edition}} of The Coral Island was {{published}} by T. Nelson & Sons, who in common with many other publishers of the time had a policy when accepting a manuscript of buying the copyright <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> rather than paying royalties; as a result, authors generally did not receive any income {{from the sale of}} subsequent editions. Ballantyne received between £50 and £60, equivalent to about £5800 as of 2012, but when the novel's popularity became evident and the number of editions increased he tried unsuccessfully to buy back the copyright. He wrote bitterly to Nelsons in 1893 about the copyrights they held on his books while he had earned nothing: [...] "for thirty-eight years [...] reaped the whole profits".|$|E
500|$|Back at his apartment, Padgett converses {{with the}} killer from his book, a {{deceased}} Brazilian surgeon named Ken Naciamento (Nestor Serrano). It is revealed that through {{some sort of}} psychic connection, Padgett's Naciamento has {{come back to life}} and has been removing hearts from victims. The two discuss motivations for the killings. Realizing that his novel prognosticates Scully's murder, Padgett heads to the incinerator to destroy his novel. Mulder intercepts him, thinking Padgett is instead simply destroying incriminatory evidence. Meanwhile, Naciamento accosts Scully. After hearing gunshots, Mulder runs toward his apartment and shockingly finds Scully on the ground, covered in blood but alive. The episode closes with a voice over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> explaining his final actions. The stranger lies stricken on the basement floor in front of the incinerator, his beating heart in hand, having [...] "... given what he could not receive".|$|E
500|$|The {{simplicity}} of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to Henry James's observation that World WarI had [...] "used up words". Hemingway offers a [...] "multi-focal" [...] photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic [...] "snapshot" [...] style creates a collage of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build {{to create a sense}} of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an [...] "embedded text" [...] bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of [...] "cutting" [...] quickly from one scene to the next; or of [...] "splicing" [...] a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> and create three-dimensional prose.|$|E
