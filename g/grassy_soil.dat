He frisked about the meadow, now here, now there, making sprightly leaps, with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig. Indeed, his motion was as light as if he were flying through the air, and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the <b>grassy</b> <b>soil</b> over which he trod. With his spotless hue, he resembled a snow drift, wafted along by the wind. Once he galloped so far away that Europa feared lest she might never see him again; so, setting up her childish voice, called him back.|$|E
60|$|It was {{now nearly}} four o'clock, and {{too late to}} visit the {{galleries}} of the Louvre, or {{to do anything else}} but walk a little way along the street. The splendor of Paris, so far as I have seen, takes me altogether by surprise: such stately edifices, prolonging themselves in unwearying magnificence and beauty, and, ever and anon, a long vista of a street, with a column rising at the end of it, or a triumphal arch, wrought in memory of some grand event. The light stone or stucco, wholly untarnished by smoke and soot, puts London to the blush, if a blush could be seen on its dingy face; but, indeed, London is not to be mentioned, nor compared even, with Paris. I never knew what a palace was till I had a glimpse of the Louvre and the Tuileries; never had my idea of a city been gratified till I trod these stately streets. The life of the scene, too, is infinitely more picturesque than that of London, with its monstrous throng of grave faces and black coats; whereas, here, you see soldiers and priests, policemen in cocked hats, Zonaves with turbans, long mantles, and bronzed, half-Moorish faces; and a great many people whom you perceive to be outside of your experience, and know them ugly to look at, and fancy them villanous. Truly, I have no sympathies towards the French people; their eyes do not win me, nor do their glances melt and mingle with mine. But they do grand and beautiful things in the architectural way; and I am grateful for it. The Place de la Concorde is a most splendid square, large enough for a nation to erect trophies in of all its triumphs; and on one side of it is the Tuileries, on the opposite side the Champs Elysees, and, on a third, the Seine, adown which we saw large cakes of ice floating, beneath the arches of a bridge. The Champs Elysees, so far as I saw it, had not a <b>grassy</b> <b>soil</b> beneath its trees, but the bare earth, white and dusty.

40|$|Abstract Background Physical objects like {{vegetation}} {{can influence}} oviposition by mosquitoes on soil or water substrates. Anopheles gambiae s. l. is generally thought to utilize puddles over bare soil as its prime larval habitat {{and to avoid}} standing water populated with vegetation. In Kisian, Kenya near Kisumu, water often pools in grassy drainage areas both during and after periods of infrequent rains, when typical puddle habitats become scarce because of drying. This {{raised the question of}} whether An. gambiae has the behavioural flexibility to switch ovipositional sites when puddles over bare soil are unavailable. Methods To test whether presence and height of grasses influenced oviposition, wild-caught gravid An. gambiae s. l. were offered paired choices between wet, bare soil and wet soil populated with mixed grasses or grasses of differing height. No-choice tests were also conducted by giving females either <b>grassy</b> <b>soil</b> or bare soil. Results In choice tests, females laid four times more eggs on bare, wet soil than soil populated with grasses. However in no-choice tests, egg output was not significantly different whether grasses were present or not. Females laid significantly more eggs on soil populated with short grass than with medium, or tall grass. Conclusion This work shows An. gambiae s. l. has the capacity to oviposit into grassy aquatic habitats when typical puddles over bare soil are unavailable. This knowledge will need to be considered in the design and implementation of programmes aimed at reducing malaria transmission by suppression of An. gambiae s. l. immatures. </p...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{dilution}} {{system for}} producing low mixing ratios of methyl bromide (MeBr) and a sensitive analytical technique {{were used to}} study the uptake of MeBr by various soils. MeBr was removed within minutes from vials incubated with soils and ∼ 10 parts per billion by volume of MeBr. Killed controls did not consume MeBr, and a mixture of the broad-spectrum antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline inhibited MeBr uptake by 98 %, indicating {{that all of the}} uptake of MeBr was biological and by bacteria. Temperature optima for MeBr uptake suggested a biological sink, yet soil moisture and temperature optima varied for different soils, implying that MeBr consumption activity by soil bacteria is diverse. The eucaryotic antibiotic cycloheximide had no effect on MeBr uptake, indicating that soil fungi were not involved in MeBr removal. MeBr consumption did not occur anaerobically. A dynamic flowthrough vial system was used to incubate soils at MeBr mixing ratios as low as those found in the remote atmosphere (5 to 15 parts per trillion by volume [pptv]). Soils consumed MeBr at all mixing ratios tested. Temperate forest and <b>grassy</b> lawn <b>soils</b> consumed MeBr most rapidly (rate constant [k] = 0. 5 min− 1), yet sandy temperate, boreal, and tropical forest soils also readily consumed MeBr. Amendments of CH 4 up to 5 % had no effect on MeBr uptake even at CH 4 :MeBr ratios of 107, and depth profiles of MeBr and CH 4 consumption exhibited very different vertical rate optima, suggesting that methanotrophic bacteria, like those presently in culture, do not utilize MeBr when it is at atmospheric mixing ratios. Data acquired with gas flux chambers in the field demonstrated the very rapid in situ consumption of MeBr by soils. Uptake of MeBr at mixing ratios found in the remote atmosphere occurs via aerobic bacterial activity, displays first-order kinetics at mixing ratios from 5 pptv to ∼ 1 part per million per volume, and is rapid enough to account for 25 % of the global annual loss of atmospheric MeBr...|$|R

The vegetation around the Bigăr spring and waterfall is dominated by compact beech forests with a frequently reduced <b>grassy</b> layer and <b>soil</b> rich in humus. On the banks of the watercourse and on the rocks around the spring there are species specific to flooding plains of the beech sub-stratum and also thermophilous and xerophilous species, many of them Balkan, Pontic or Mediterranean elements.

40|$|Aphis gossypii {{is a major}} pest of Cucurbitaceae crops as much by causing primary damages (sap uptake) as {{by being}} an {{important}} vector of viruses. The Vat gene confers to the melon a resistance to the colonization by A. gossypii {{as well as a}} resistance to the not persistent viruses (CMV, WMV, [...] ) transmitted by these aphids. It is however ineffective to block the transmission of the viruses carried by other aphid species. The use of Vat is thus generally coupled with aphicid treatments to limit the viral transmission by the not colonizing aphids. However, the progressive reduction of the usage of the phytosanitary products in the crop protection imposed by the evolution of the regulation (plan Ecophyto 2018) leads to look for new strategies integrating cultural practices and genetics for the management of the bioagressors. The bibliography suggests that the management of field margins (strips sown with non host grass or flower mixtures) could be an effective option to decrease 1) the aphid pressure (and thus the risk of bypassing Vat) by favoring the development of natural enemies and 2) the virus pressure by constituting a filter reducing the viral load of aphids before they reach the crop. The hypothesis tested in this project is that an adequate manipulation of the environment of the crop can contribute to regulate the populations of aphids and their viral load and therefore {{to reduce the risk of}} viral epidemics.

40|$|The {{transition}} of grasslands to forests influences many ecosystem processes, including water and temperature regimes and the cycling of nutrients. Different {{components of the}} carbon biogeochemical cycle respond strongly to woody plant encroachmentas a consequence, the carbon balance of the invaded grasslands can change markedly. In our research, we studied the response of soil respiration (RS) to natural succession of calcareous grassland. We established two research sites, called grassland and invaded site, at each of which eddy flux measurement were also performed. Within these sites, triplicate plots were fenced for soil flux measurements. At the invaded site, measurements were performed for forest patches and <b>grassy</b> spaces separately. <b>Soil</b> respiration was strongly dependent on temperature and reached 8 – 12 µmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1 in mid-summerit was greater at the grassland than at the invaded site. RS dependence on temperature and soil water content was similar between the different vegetation covers (grassland, gaps and forest patches). At a reference temperature of 10 °C, the average RS was 2. 71 µmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1. The annual sums of RS were also similar between years and sites: 1345 ± 47 (2009) and 1150 ± 37 g C m− 2 year− 1 (2010) for grassland and 1324 ± 26 (2009) and 1268 ± 26 g C m− 2 year− 1 (2010) for the invaded site, {{which is at the}} upper range of the values reported in the literature. Cumulative RS peaked in July, with about 200 g C m− 2. Large mid-summer RS rates rely on strong biological activity supported by high, but non-extreme soil temperatures and by regular summer precipitation.

40|$|Is {{shifting}} cultivation (slash-and-burn) just inefficient, and destructive {{of the soil}} and local biodiversity? Or does it offer promising models? For thousands of years, {{shifting cultivation}} has fed many, {{and it continues to}} support the livelihoods of 300 million people worldwide. And that is a conservative estimate. It can be defined in numerous ways but it is best described as a practice whereby farmers clear a patch of forest or savanna, often using fire to release the nutrients for growing crops, and then alternate periods of cultivation with periods of fallow, during which the forest and soil fertility are allowed to be restored, while the farmers shift to a new patch. Besides having many names, milpa in Belize, swidden on Niue or chitemene in southern and central Africa this way of farming has many faces, which for a long time were not recognised but lumped together. The general belief has been that in cases of low population densities and abundant forests, the periods of fallow were long enough to make this method of farming sustainable. Steady population growth during the twentieth century was assumed to have increased the pressure on the forest, unacceptably shortening fallow periods. This also led to soil depletion and shrinking forests and forced farmers to move to more marginal lands. Combine this with agriculture being modernised and intensified, and needing to meet growing demands for food, and it seems not so strange that shifting cultivation was denounced as irrational and destructive. This has certainly been true in part but research in the 1990 s found that it might be a pity to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Limiting their shifts The lessons were not slow in coming. The Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn Programme, coordinated by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), was established in 1992 on the basis of assumptions similar to those described above. They did not entirely hold true. Case studies around the world indicated that although more than 15 million ha of tropical moist forests disappeared each year due to slash-and-burn farming, only 17 % of the shifting cultivators cleared actual primary forest and an even smaller percentage eventually brought about a permanent treeless form of land use. Increased deforestation {{is more likely to be}} the result of civil war, drought, market mechanisms and government policies than of slash-and-burn. For instance, changes from communal to private ownership of land is giving way to loggers, miners, plantation farmers and cattle ranchers, at the same time literally stopping the shifting cultivators in their tracks. This applies less to central Africa, where deforestation in the forest fringes of the Congo basin is indeed largely caused by smallholder agriculture. Yet there are other reasons for farmers to abandon shifting cultivation and to adopt a sedentary way of farming: the vicinity of markets, schools and infrastructure also encourages people to settle. Low yielding but stable No two farmers are the same, and shifting cultivation is not one uniform way of farming. The Overseas Development Institute, a UK based research body, points out that indigenous communities, who often live in remote areas, have developed their way of farming over generations and apply long fallow periods and complex farm management practices. Each decision is carefully taken on the basis of sound agronomic criteria, resulting in a low yielding but stable and sustainable food production. On the other hand there are the new settlers, often nearer to urban areas, who focus on short-term gains from cash crops, use short fallow periods until the soil is depleted, or just move on and on. In between these two extremes, there isa continuum of farming men and women who shift part of their operations once in a while but return later. In forests, which can sustain the existing population of shifting cultivators, the practice even contributes positively to the system s biodiversity. In these cases it is crucial that the mosaic of patches in different stages of fallow, forest cover and cultivation does not get too fragmented and threaten any of the natural tree species in their survival. Where the shifting cycle cannot be maintained, a conversion to sedentary agro-forestry cultivation systems can be an option too. The central issue here is to maintain soil fertility more effectively. In recent years a whole spectrum of viable alternatives to expensive chemical fertilisers has become available. For instance improved fallow techniques which enrich the natural fallow vegetation through the planting of nitrogen-fixing and multipurpose trees to improve soil productivity. Applying manure from livestock, green manuring, mulching, planting cover crops for inter-cropping and alley farming are other examples. Agroforestry systems can be good alternatives too, such as multi-storey cultivation, systems that allow natural tree species to rejuvenate alongside annual crops and economic trees. It would not harm to lend an ear to the traditional shifting cultivators themselves or, as Paul Sillitoe of the University of Durham in England argues, to combine anthropological research with soil science. His work explained how the Wola of Papua New Guinea have developed their own sustainable system while avoiding their traditionally long fallow periods. They grow non-perennial crops semi-permanently by incorporating compost from <b>grassy</b> fallows into <b>soil</b> mounds, with sweet potato as a staple crop. Where there s a will, there s a way.
