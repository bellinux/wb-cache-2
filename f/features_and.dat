30|$|Self-regulation {{scores were}} {{significantly}} correlated only with WMC scores and ITRTs for both <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> conjunction foraging. WMC scores were only {{significantly correlated with}} ITRTs during feature foraging. This contrasts with previous analyses where HTKS scores and WMC scores were correlated with completed trials. This suggests that age, which was controlled for in the partial correlation table, might explain effects in earlier ANOVAs. A multivariate ANOVA with completed trials during <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> conjunction foraging as the dependent variables, age (binned by year of birth) as the fixed factor, and HTKS and WMC scores as covariates tested this. The results suggest that age does indeed have a strong effect {{on the number of}} completed trials (F(2, 65)[*]=[*] 7.35 p[*]<[*] 0.001 for <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> F(2, 65)[*]=[*] 8.04 p[*]<[*] 0.001 for conjunction foraging). The HTKS effect was still significant both for the completed trial number during <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> conjunction foraging (F(1, 65)[*]=[*] 5.05 p[*]=[*] 0.028, <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> F(1, 65)[*]=[*] 8.25 p[*]=[*] 0.006 conjunction). The effect for the WMC scores is weaker, with the effect for feature foraging only marginally significant and the effect for conjunction foraging still not significant (F(1, 65)[*]=[*] 3.12 p[*]=[*] 0.082, <b>feature</b> <b>and</b> F(1, 65)[*]=[*] 0.95 p[*]=[*] 0.334, conjunction). The effect for HTKS scores on the number of completed trials is still there, even when controlling for age, albeit weaker.|$|R
