40|$|Fluvial {{sandstones}} constitute one of {{the major}} clastic petroleum reservoir types in many sedimentary basins around the world. This is especially true in the Tertiary basins of Southeast Asia, which display a wide range of fluvial channel reservoir types. This study is based on the analysis of high-resolution, shallow (seabed to ca. 500 m depth) 3 D seismic data which provide exceptional imaging of the geometry, dimension and temporal and spatial distribution of fluvial channels. The Malay Basin comprises a thick (> 8 km), rift to post-rift Oligo-Miocene to Pliocene basin-fill. The youngest (Miocene to Pliocene), post-rift succession is dominated by a thick (1 - 5 km), cyclic succession of coastal plain and coastal deposits, which accumulated in a humidtropical climatic setting. This study focuses on the Pleistocene to Recent (ca. 500 m thick) succession, which comprises a range of seismic facies, mainly reflecting changes in fluvial channel style and gross stratigraphic architecture. The succession has been divided into four seismic units (Unit 1 - 4), bounded by basin-wide stratal surfaces. Units 3 and 4 have been further divided into two sub-units. Two types of boundaries have been identified: 1) a boundary that is defined by a regionally-extensive erosion surface {{at the base of a}} prominent incised valley (e. <b>g.</b> <b>Horizons</b> C. 1 and D. 1); 2) a sequence boundary that is defined by more weakly-incised, straight and low-sinuosity channels which is interpreted as lowstand alluvial bypass channel systems (e. <b>g.</b> <b>Horizons</b> A, B, C, and D). Each unit displays a predictable vertical change of the channel pattern and scale, with wide low-sinuosity channels at the base passing gradationally upwards into narrow high-sinuosity channels at the top. The wide variation in channel style and size is interpreted to be controlled mainly by the sea-level fluctuations on the widely flat and tectonically-quiescent Sundaland Platform.

The application of these preliminary scales to bibliographic data demonstrated a good accuracy with the previous classification of these sites as "non contaminated" or "contaminated" sites, and allowed to propose a first map of contamination for different trace- metals at the sub regional level (e. g.

40|$|Burst {{assembly}} {{mechanism is}} one of the fundamental factors that determine the performance of an optical burst switching (OBS) network. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the number of burstifiers on TCP performance for an OBS network. The goodput of TCP flows between an ingress node and an egress node traveling through an optical network is studied as the number of assembly buffers per destination varies. First, the burst-length independent losses resulting from the contention in the core OBS network using a non-void-filling burst scheduling algorithm, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>Horizon,</b> are studied. Then, burst-length dependent losses arising as a result of void-filling scheduling algorithms, e. g., LAUC-VF, are studied for two different TCP flow models: FTP-type long-lived flows and variable size short-lived flows. Simulation results show that for both types of scheduling algorithms, both types of TCP flow models, and different TCP versions (Reno, Newreno and Sack), TCP goodput increases as the number of burst assemblers per egress node is increased for an OBS network employing timer-based assembly algorithm. The improvement from one burstifier to moderate number of burst assemblers is significant (15 - 50 % depending on the burst loss probability, per-hop processing delay, and the TCP version), but the goodput difference between moderate number of buffers and per-flow aggregation is relatively small, implying that an OBS edge switch should use moderate number of assembly buffers per destination for enhanced TCP performance without substantially increasing the hardware complexity. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

The site {{is located in}} northern France, {{at the center of}} a former entry lane to a bunker of World War 11, temporarily paved with coarse industrial waste fragments and removed at the end of the war. Thin sections made from undisturbed soil samples from A and B horizons were studied.

The chemical composition of the spherulites was dominated by Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Ca, and P.

Their formation was related to several factors: (i) liberation of metal elements due to weathering of waste products, (ii) Ca and P supply from fertilizing practices, (iii) co-precipitation of metal elements and Ca and P in a Porous soil environment, after slow exudation of a supersaturated soil solution in more confined mineral media.

The results show that rutted areas have: (1) a significant decrease of total porosity in the eluvial upper layers of the soil (0 - 30 cm depth), associated with an important lowering of the transmission pore volume {{and a decrease in}} macroporosity to about 6 % of the total soil volume, i. e. to less than the current threshold value for root viability (10 %); (2) a reduction of macropore space to about 9. 5 % in the lower illuvial horizons (30 - 50 cm depth); (3) a decrease of redox potential due to temporary waterlogging, inducing (a) the occurrence of reduced forms of iron, (b) a strong leaching of iron oxyhydroxides from the E(g) to the B(1 <b>g)</b> <b>horizon,</b> (c) an increase of organically complexed iron forms in both the Es and B(tg) horizons, and (d) high solubility of Goethite and even of ferromagnesium minerals in the eluvial horizons; (4) an increase of clay dispersibility in both the E(g) and B(tg) horizons.

Methods/results: Research has been organised using the “DISH” model which represents four areas of food and health research: Determinants of dietary behaviour; Intake of foods and nutrients; Status and functional markers of nutritional health; Health and disease risks of foods and nutrients. The project consists of three phases: - Phase one (completed July 2013) : Desk research, interviews (N= 30) and stakeholder workshop conducted to map existing research infrastructure and identify gaps and needs. Initial findings suggested that research infrastructure was developed to different degrees across the four “DISH” research areas. - Phase two: Synthesis of research infrastructures and or different areas of research and explore the governance of research infrastructure. - Phase three: Feasible designs and roadmaps for the future development of research infrastructure. Conclusions: The EuroDISH vision is to encourage the development of infrastructures that bring together resources and knowledge from different scientific fields.

40|$|Most {{scientific}} {{organizations have}} established bibliographic databases {{to collect and}} present the scholarly output generated by their researchers and research projects. Additional requirements arise from increasing OpenAccess requirements by funders more and more paired with direct data delivery (e. <b>g.</b> <b>Horizon</b> 2020). To alleviate the burden of administrative reporting JOIN² has broadened the scope of traditional OpenAccess repositories to include these additional, administrative data like funding, licencing, cost information (e. g. APC based Gold OpenAccess). Recent developments include DOI minting via DataCite and ORCiD integration. However, to fulfill all the detailed requirements {{a very high level}} of normalization is required, traditionally not available in Dublin Core based repositories. Based on invenio and the much broader Marc 21 meta data schema, JOIN² repositories implemented this normalization based on authority records right from the start. To this end JOIN² holds about 118. 000 authority records used by and interchanged between all partners. About 72. 000 of these refer to scientific journals that need to be updated once a year to reflect changes in statistical keys required for evaluation procedures. Currently operating seven independent, on site implementations in production, for JOIN² it is vitally important to implement a collaborative curation of these records and effective sharing mechanism to minimize the work for partners. For evaluation purposes, JOIN² is currently investigating the bibliographic subset of the upcoming national German evaluation schema Kerndatensatz Forschung (KDSF). Though, JOIN² was designed long before the discussion on this schema started, it turned out that almost all criteria can be met out of the box by means of JOIN²'s authority control mechanisms, while trouble usually results from flaws in the KDSF defintions and should be addressed there. Data delivery in CERIF formats may thus be a feature for future implementation. This poster will outline procedures for authority record generation and interchange between JOIN² partners as well as some usage scenarios implemented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Continuous glucose {{monitoring}} (CGM) {{data can}} be exploited to prevent hypo-/hyperglycemic events in real time by forecasting future glucose levels. In the last few years, several glucose prediction algorithms have been proposed, but how to compare them (e. g., methods based on polynomial rather than autoregressive time-series models) and even how to determine the optimal parameter set for a given method (e. <b>g.,</b> prediction <b>horizon</b> and forgetting) are open problems. Methods: A new index, J, is proposed to optimally design a prediction algorithm by taking into account two key components: the regularity of the predicted profile and the time gained thanks to prediction. Effectiveness of J is compared with previously proposed criteria such as the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and continuous glucose-error grid analysis (CG-EGA) on 20 Menarini (Florence, Italy) Glucoday® CGM data sets. Results: For a given prediction algorithm, the new index J is able to suggest a more consistent and better parameter set (e. <b>g.,</b> prediction <b>horizon</b> and forgetting factor of choice) than RMSE and CG-EGA. In addition, the minimization of J can reliably be used as a selection criterion in comparing different prediction methods.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has investigated ways to quantify visual information {{of a scene}} {{in terms of a}} visual processing hierarchy, i. e., making sense of visual environment by segmentation and integration of elementary sensory input. Guided by this research, studies have developed categories for low-level visual features (e. g., edges, colors), high-level visual features (scene-level entities that convey semantic information such as objects), and how models of those features predict aesthetic preference and naturalness. For example, in Kardan et al. (2015 a), 52 participants provided aesthetic preference and naturalness ratings, which are used in the current study, for 307 images of mixed natural and urban content. Kardan et al. (2015 a) then developed a model using low-level features to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness and could do so with high accuracy. What has yet to be explored is the ability of higher-level visual features (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>horizon</b> line position relative to viewer, geometry of building distribution relative to visual access) to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness of scenes, and whether higher-level features mediate some of the association between the low-level features and aesthetic preference or naturalness. In this study we investigated these relationships and found that low- and high- level features explain 68. 4 % of the variance in aesthetic preference ratings and 88. 7 % of the variance in naturalness ratings. Additionally, several high-level features mediated the relationship between the low-level visual features and aaesthetic preference. In a multiple mediation analysis, the high-level feature mediators accounted for over 50 % of the variance in predicting aesthetic preference. These results show that high-level visual features play a prominent role predicting aesthetic preference, but do not completely eliminate the predictive power of the low-level visual features. These strong predictors provide powerful insights for future research relating to landscape and urban design with the aim of maximizing subjective well-being, which could lead to improved health outcomes on a larger scale...|$|E

Since 2008, the FWF has required its grant recipients to make their research output as openly accessible as possible (the FWF’s Open Access Compliance Monitoring) and has assisted them in doing so. Whereas open access to publications has been a requirement for years, the FWF still treats open access to research data as a recommendation rather than a mandate. Accordingly, the FWF’s Open Access Policy states, “Whenever legally and ethically possible, all research data and similar materials which are collected and/or analysed using FWF funds have to be made openly accessible. Data underlying the published research results should either be openly accessible immediately or – if not used in publications – two years after the project is finished. ” Although the FWF does not yet require grant recipients to make their research data openly accessible, they are explicitly asked to budget funds over each project’s duration to ensure the preparation, archiving, open access and re-use of research data (see Application Guidelines for Stand-Alone projects).

40|$|The prior {{presentation}} of a word enhances {{the probability that the}} word will be identified from a degraded cue. This enhancement, or priming, may occur without recollection of the prior presentation. In investigations of the effect of delay on nonrecollective memory, priming of word completion may occur at long delays after the initial word presentation (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>HORIZON)</b> when the degraded cue contains scattered letters (e. g., R Z) but not when the degraded cue contains the initial letters (e. g., HOR). These particular cues are known as fragments and stems respectively. Priming of fragment completion may occur weeks after the study presentation whereas priming of stem completion may disappear within hours. The present research investigated this apparent discrepancy between the duration of priming effect for the two types of cues by examining completion of both within the same experiment. Particularly, it tested the hypothesis that the decline in priming of completion is greater when cues have many possible completions. Subjects completed fragments that have 1 completion or fragments and stems that have more than 7 completions. Priming was measured over a 48 -hour delay interval in each of 4 experiments. Priming of stem completion declined at a greater rate than priming of fragment completion over the 48 -hour interval, thus replicating within a single experiment the previous between-experiment findings. The number-of-completions hypothesis was not rejected in Experiments 1 and 3 because the decline in priming of multiple fragment completion did not differ from the decline in priming of stem or unique fragment completion. However, in Experiment 2 the decline in priming of multiple fragment completion differed from the decline in priming of stem completion but not from the decline in priming of unique fragment completion. Thus, the number-of-completions hypothesis may not be a viable explanation of the differential effect of delay on priming of fragment and stem completion. When the same words served in both the unique fragment and stem conditions, the effect of delay on priming of completion was similar for both conditions (Experiment 4) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of a Kalman filter (KF) to predict, within the shutdown system (SDS) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), whether a safety parameter measurement will reach a corresponding trip set-point (TSP). The proposed predictive SDS (PSDS) designs aim to initiate shutdown actions at a time which is earlier than conventional shutdown initiation. These early detections are, in turn, expected to improve safety and productivity margins within the NPP. The KF-based point-PSDS design utilizes a linear time-varying (LTV) system model to predict mean safety parameter measurements for comparison against the TSP. The KF considers noise covariances that either have assumed predetermined values, or are estimated online using an adaptive limited memory filter (ALMF). The PSDS is enhanced to consider, by recursive least squares (RLS) estimation, conditions that are uncertain with respect to the assumed system model and noise properties. The result is a KF⁄RLS-based PSDS that compensates for prediction error by RLS-based estimation of deterministic disturbances to the system state and measurement. The PSDS is further enhanced to calculate confidence intervals for the predictions {{as a function of the}} propagated error covariance. This enhancement results in interval-PSDS designs that consider confidence in an impending condition by comparing predetermined confidence interval bounds against the TSP. Finally, an optimal-PSDS design is formulated to adapt the effective prediction, e. <b>g.</b> <b>horizon</b> or bias, by limiting and minimizing the probability of missed and false trip occurrences respectively using hypothesis testing methods and optimal alarm theory. In this manner, the optimal-PSDS is made aware of the quality of past predictions. The PSDS designs are compared, through simulation and experiment, against a conventional SDS in terms of response time or time-to-trip for the steam generator level low (SGLL) safety parameter under various conditions of uncertainty, e. g. parameter error or unmeasurable signals. MATLAB-based simulations demonstrate that the PSDS designs are able to reduce time-to-trip. The PSDS designs are then implemented within a Tricon v 9 safety-PLC with a scan time that adheres to current nuclear industry regulations. The experimental results reveal that a reduced time-to-trip can be achieved for a real-world system with unknown system-model mismatch...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{contaminated}} soil {{as a source}} for water contamination has been largely neglected from the South African legislation. Inconsistent evaluation and remediation of contaminated sites have resulted in many sources of water contamination not being sufficiently addressed. The Draft National Norms and Standards for the Remediation of Contaminated Land and Soil Quality (GN 233 of 2012) (henceforth Norms and Standards) was published for comments and suggestions in August 2012. A number of uncertainties have been identified that may impact on the successful implementation of the Framework and the Norms and Standards. Some of the issues are related specifically to the setting of soil screening values (SSV) for protection of water resources. There is no particular method specified to determine the soluble fraction of contaminants in soil. In a phase 1 assessment SSVs are used to judge whether constituents present in the soils are at concentrations high enough to pose a potential risk to the receiving environment. With the determination of the SSV a known water quality standard is converted to a total concentration by making use of a dilution factor and partitioning coefficient (Kd). The proposed Kd values in the Framework are surrounded by uncertainties and information regarding Kd values for South African soils are limited. In addition, the Framework {{does not take into account}} the natural background concentration of soils to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural contamination. Setting appropriate extraction method plays the key role for an objective and standardised initial assessment of soluble concentrations in the soil. Similarly, the selection of appropriate Kd values based on soil properties minimizes the uncertainties during the estimation of SSV. Appropriate screening of contaminated land is imperative to the registration of contaminated land and has significant implications for industry, government and the environment. The aims of this study were: a) to assess fast and simple analytical methodologies which can be performed by a commercial laboratory to mimic the standard saturated paste extraction method to determine soluble metal concentration in soils, b) to determine Kd values for selected South African soils in 10 soil horizons, and c) to determine baseline concentration ranges for selected soluble contaminants to assist in the setting of appropriate soil screening values for the protection of water resources. The study will test the hypothesis that a 1 : 2. 5 (soil:water ratio) water extraction could better mimic the standard saturated paste extraction than the 1 : 20 ratio, commonly used in USA. The 1 : 2. 5 ratio can be done by most commercial laboratories and gives a better indication of the pore water quality. To assess analytical methods, four extraction methods (1 : 2. 5, 1 : 5, 1 : 10 and 1 : 20 soil:water) were tested against the standard saturated paste extraction using three trace metals (Cu, Pb and V). These three metals were selected based on reactivity and environmental abundance. Lead and Cu are B type metals which complex readily with organic material and are generally more environmentally toxic. Anthropogenic activities are increasing enrichment of B type metals in the environment. Vanadate is an A type metal and is redox sensitive. Its association with the Bushveld complex was the reason for its inclusion in this study. The baseline soluble concentrations of Cu, Pb, and V were determined for selected 100 South African soils using the extraction method selected above. The Kd values of Cu, Pb, and V were determined for selected 10 soil horizons (1 : 1 clay dominated A horizon, Vertic soil dominated by 2 : 1 clay minerals, Yellow oxidic / Plinthic (Soft plinthic B horizon), low clay red oxidic B horizon, red oxidic B horizon, plinthic B horizon, gleyed horizon (<b>G</b> <b>horizon),</b> melanic A horizon, orthic A horizon with high organic content (OC) and E-horizon) using a batch method. For each constituent three different metal concentrations were added to each of the soil horizons. After extraction the concentration in the solution was used to determine the amount of metal sorbed to the soil. Considering the standard saturated paste extract as a bench mark, the 1 : 2. 5 soil:water ratio extraction gave more representative soil pore water quality for Cu, Pb and V in the low to medium concentrations. Therefore, the hypothesis was accepted. It was also apparent that the Kd values selected for the Framework are not representative of typical South African soils. The Kd values for Cu range between 12. 7 and 19044 L kg- 1. These values exceeded the value of 10 L kg- 1 provided by the Framework in all soils. For V the Kd values (10. 5 – 865 L kg- 1) in all soils were lower than the value of 1000 L kg- 1 specified in the Framework. For Pb, the Kd of 100 L kg- 1 as indicated in the Framework is not representative of soils found in South Africa. For Pb, low clay content, weathered soils have lower Kd values, whereas higher clay content soils have Kd values up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the Kd in the Framework. Therefore, due to the large variability in Kd values, a single value cannot be used for all soil types. To conclude, the 1 : 2. 5 soil:water ratio was found to be more representative to the soil pore content especially in the low to medium solute concentrations. The study also showed that a single Kd value cannot be used across soil types. The Kd values currently used in the Framework have low representativity of the South African soils. In the meantime, the Kd values for Cu, Pb, and V generated from this study for selected South African soil horizons could be used by the framework. There is, however, a need to develop local Kd values of contaminants across soil types.

30|$|With 5 <b>G</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> new {{waveforms}} for the PHY layer are investigated {{that are}} suitable for the upcoming requirements [1]. In particular, good time-frequency localization (TFL) of the transmit signal is required to cope with asynchronicities [2] {{and to provide a}} low out-of-band (OOB) radiation, which is needed for spectral agility and carrier aggregation. Filtered multicarrier (MC) systems [3] provide the means for good TFL by adaptation of the prototype filter, and spectral agility is achieved by switching on and off certain subcarriers. High spectral efficiency is important to serve the increased demand for high-speed data access [1]. Hence, a future waveform should transmit symbols at the Nyquist rate in order to not waste valuable time-frequency resources.|$|R
40|$|I review {{elements}} of the foundations of black-hole theory with attention to problematic issues, and describe some techniques which either seem {{to help with the}} difficulties or at least investigate their scope. The definition of black holes via event horizons has been problematic because it depends on knowing the global structure of space-time; often attempts to avoid this (e. <b>g.</b> apparent <b>horizons)</b> require knowledge of the interior geometry. I suggest studying instead the holonomy relating the exterior neighborhood of the incipient horizon to the regime of distant observers; at least in the spherically symmetric case, this holonomy will develop certain universal features, in principle observable from signals emitted from infalling objects. I discuss the theory of quantum fields in curved space-time, and the difficulties with Hawking's prediction of black-hole radiation. I then show that the usual, very natural, theory of quantum fields in curved space-time runs into difficulties when applied to measurement problems, interactions, zero-point effects and stress-energies. I suggest that we take seriously the possibility that this theory, for all its naturalness, may not be quite right. Comment: Write-up of talks given at BSCG XIV; 50 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Cocoa {{is one of}} {{plantation}} commodities that {{is quite}} important for the national economy. Land management {{for the development of}} this plant should pay attention to the characteristics of the soil. Three soil profiles formed from alluvium parent material in East Kolaka Regency were investigated to determine the mineralogical, physical, and chemical soil properties, as well as the potential of the land for the development of cocoa plant. The results showed that the mineral composition of the sand fraction was dominated by quartz, while the clay mineral fraction was composed of kaolinite, hydrate halloysite, interstratified of illite-vermiculite and smectite. The soils were characterized by poor drainage, low bulk density (0. 78 to 0. 95 g / cm 3), moderate available water pores (10 - 15 %), slow to fast permeability (0. 10 to 14. 05 cm / h), silty clay loam to silty clay texture of top soil, acidic soil reaction (pH 4. 62 to 5. 47), high organic C content (3. 86 to 4. 60 %) in the top soil and very low organic C content (< 0. 65 %) in the lower layer, moderate to high available P (14 - 38 mg / kg) in the A horizon and very low to moderate (1 - 18 mg / kg) in horizon B, moderate to high P 2 O 5 (30 - 71 mg / 100 <b>g)</b> in <b>horizon</b> A and extremely low (1 - 11 mg / 100 <b>g)</b> in <b>horizon</b> B, very low to moderate K 2 O (3 - 28 mg / 100 g), moderate to high exchangeable Ca (9. 32 to 13. 92 cmolc / kg) in the upper and lower (0. 70 to 5. 04 cmolc / kg) in the bottom layer, high exchangeable Mg content (2. 83 to 8. 95 cmolc / kg), high soil CEC (34. 18 to 38. 28 cmolc / kg) in the upper layer and low to moderate (7. 87 to 20. 39 cmolc / kg) in the bottom layer, moderate to high base saturation (44 - 68 %), and very low to moderate Al saturation (0 - 17 %). At the family level, the soil was classified as Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts (EK 1 profile) and Typic Endoaquepts (EK 2 and EK 3 profiles), finely loamy, mix, acid, isohypertermik. The land was marginally suitable (S 3) for cocoa plant with the contraints of impeded drainage, acid soil reaction, and low K 2 O. Drainage channel management can be done to increase the carrying capacity of the land for the development of cocoa plant...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{control of}} {{industrial}} processes {{is often difficult}} and complex. The product composition and moisture content changes as disturbances affect the upstream production processes. When there are changes in the product content, simple control configurations may not work due {{to changes in the}} drying characteristics of the product. This thesis presents a general conveyor-belt dryer model describing a six-zone multiple-pass dryer, accounting for the falling rate drying period, input disturbances, conveyor-belts with different belt speeds and product bed heights. In addition, a description is presented of how linear input dynamics can be included in the dryer model. Furthermore, open loop simulations are performed in order to investigate the behavior of the model. The model is linearized and reduced, in order to be utilized in a model-based control solution (MPC), where stability and feasibility is ensured through an algorithm based on known techniques within the field of model predictive control (e. <b>g.</b> infinite <b>horizon</b> optimalization, target optimalization routine, soft constraints and a Kalman filter). Several closed loop simulation examples are presented, illustrating reference steps and disturbance rejection. Furthermore, a modeling error is introduced in order to investigate the limitations imposed by model uncertainty. Finally, a basic control solution (PI control) is compared to the model-based control. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the idea of a multi-functional wide-field star tracker (WFST) and {{provides}} a description of the current state-of-the-art in this field. The idea comes from a proposal handed in to ESA at the beginning of 2011. Star trackers (STs) usually have more than one object-lens with a small Field-of-View. They provide very precise information about the attitude in space according to consecutive evaluation of star positions. Our idea of WFST will combine the functions of several instruments, e. <b>g.</b> ST, a <b>horizon</b> sensor, and an all-sky photometry camera. WFST will use a fish-eye lens. There is no comparable product on the present-day market. Nowadays, spacecraft have to carry several instruments for these applications.

40|$|Biological soil crusts {{result from}} an {{intimate}} association between soil particles and cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, and bryophytes (in different proportions) which live within, or immediately on top of, the uppermost millimeters of soil. Soil particles are aggregated through {{the presence and}} activity of these biota, and the resultant living crust covers {{the surface of the}} ground as a coherent layer (Fig. 1. 1). This definition does not include communities where soil particles are not aggregated by these organisms (e. <b>g.,</b> cyanobacterial/algal <b>horizons</b> in littoral sand and mudflats), where organisms are not in close contact with the soil surface (e. g., thick moss-lichen mats growing on top of decaying organic material, as in boreal regions), nor where the majority of the biomass is above the soil surface (e. g., large club-moss mats found in North American grasslands or dense stands of fruticose lichens, such as Niebla and Teloschistes species from the coastal fog deserts of California and of Namibia, respectively). However, the boundaries between the latter communities and biological soil crusts are fluid. In a similar fashion, there is no strict dividing line between the cyanobacterial, green algal, and fungal species that occur in soil-crust communities, yet are also found in a multitude of additional habitats (e. g., intertidal mates, tree trunks and leaves, rock faces) ...|$|R
40|$|The field {{equation}} of orthodox general relativity {{are written in}} the context of a geometry with non-vanishing torsion, the Absolute Parallelism (AP) geometry. An AP-structure, with homogeneity and isotropy, is used for cosmological applications. The resulting dynamical equations are those of FRW-Standard cosmology, which have many problems e. <b>g.</b> singularity, particle <b>horizons,</b> [...] . etc. We suggest a new scheme for investigating the effect of torsion on the dynamics of FRW-Cosmology, without changing the basic structure of general relativity. It is shown that some of these problems will disappear if the torsion, associated with AP-structure used, is inserted in to the dynamical equations. Diagnose shows that problems arise when GR is written {{in the context of}} a geometry with vanishing torsion, the Riemannian geometry. This reflects the importance of using more wider geometries in studying physical phenomena. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Replanning is a {{powerful}} mechanism for controlling robot motion under hard constraints and unpredictable disturbances, but it involves an inherent tradeoff between the planner’s power (e. <b>g.,</b> a planning <b>horizon</b> or time cutoff) and its responsiveness to disturbances. We present a real-time replanning technique that uses adaptive time stepping to learn {{the amount of time}} needed for a sample-based motion planner to make monotonic progress toward the goal. The technique is robust to the typically high variance exhibited by planning queries, and we prove that it is asymptotically complete for a deterministic environment and a static objective. For unpredictable environments, we present an adaptive time stepping contingency planning algorithm that achieves simultaneous safety-seeking and goal-seeking motion. These techniques generate responsive and safe motion in simulated scenarios across a range of difficulties, including applications to pursuit-evasion and aggressive collision-free teleoperation of an industrial robot arm in a cluttered environment. ...|$|R

As with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the density of dark and baryonic matter imprints important scales on the fluctuations of matter and thus the clustering of galaxies, e. <b>g.,</b> the particle <b>horizon</b> at matter [...] radiation equality and the sound horizon at recombination. Precision measurements of these scales from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the large scale shape of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering provide constraints on Omega_m h^ 2.

40|$|We {{identify}} all symmetry superalgebras <b>g</b> of near <b>horizon</b> geometries {{of black}} holes with a Killing horizon, assuming {{the solution is}} smooth and that the spatial {{cross section of the}} event horizon is compact without boundary. This includes all warped AdS_ 2 backgrounds with the most general allowed fluxes in 10 - and 11 -dimensional supergravities. If the index of a particular Dirac operator vanishes, we find that the even symmetry subalgebra decomposes as g_ 0 =sl(2,R) ⊕t_ 0, where t_ 0 /c is the Lie algebra of a group that acts transitively and effectively on spheres, and c is the center of g. If the Dirac operator index does not vanish, then the symmetry superalgebra is nilpotent with one even generator. We also demonstrate that there are no near horizon geometries, and also therefore no warped AdS_ 2 backgrounds, in 10 - and 11 -dimensions that preserve more than 16 supersymmetries.
