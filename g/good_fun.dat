500|$|Regarding {{comparisons}} between {{the game and the}} Austin Powers film series, Hubbard pointed out on several occasions that, unlike Austin Powers, No One Lives Forever is not a parody of the spy genre. Contrasting the source of the humor in the two series, Hubbard noted that while the game is [...] "campy and silly, [...] the underlying premise borders on apocalyptic. That dichotomy in tone results in a very different style of humor from a parody, where everything is in <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> and nobody, including the characters, takes anything very seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; in which negative assessments sorted {{the film as}} [...] "silly and illogical" [...] and [...] "begins with the same flawed premise" [...] of its precursor, while positive evaluations eulogized the film as [...] "a real jolter for horror fans", [...] "recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter", and [...] "surprisingly <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> for {{the current crop of}} horror films". The film grossed $46 million domestically and $43 million overseas, earning $90 million internationally. It was also nominated for four awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could let go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E

Davide Ambrosiani (IGN) said Fallout 4s last expansion pack added some interesting mechanics and expands the world further. Juan Garcia (IGN) wrote about how he believed the expansion added a [...] "great new location" [...] which added a few more hours of gameplay, although it was more limited and repetitive than he wanted.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{directed}} in February 1997 by Gregg Masuak, and filmed in a theatre {{located in the}} north of London. It features the Spice Girls singing and dancing solo in front of various colourful backgrounds whilst filmed with a steadycam. Other scenes show the group performing on a stage in front of an energetic crowd. In addition, there are many background performers doing unusual tricks. Chisholm wrote about the shoot: [...] "We shot the video for 'Who Do You Think You Are' in a really mad club—a real dive. The toilets were horrible and we had to have our make-up done in a Winnebago. The vibe was excellent, though—I think it was my favourite video because it was such <b>good</b> <b>fun.</b> I felt like a proper pop star. [...] It was just how you imagine it when you're young".|$|E
500|$|As filming for the 1964 season approached, fourteen-year-old Jon Provost {{chose not}} renew his contract. Stars Lockhart and Reilly were fired.

Lockhart loved her role as [...] "Lassie's mother", but accepted her fate, telling columnist Bob Thomas: It was an actor's dream -- steady work, excellent pay, a wonderful cast and crew, and a chance to do a good scene now and then...Now I'm ready to go back playing all those tramps and neurotic and alcoholic women.

[...] According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine, the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable, even if [...] "wholeheartedly sexist". Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's [...] "advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree", but [...] "without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play" [...] and those who played the original [...] "will probably find the new edition a waste of time and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures." [...] In 2004, Adventure Gamers' Rob Michaud wrote: [...] "Despite its weaknesses, it's a bona fide gaming classic, a must-play for adventure history buffs as well as those who just like risqué humor." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2005, Radiohead asked {{producer}} Spike Stent, who {{had worked}} with artists including U2 and Björk, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told Mojo: [...] "Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they’d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'" [...] The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006. In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour {{for the first time since}} 2004; according to Yorke, [...] "We basically had all these half-formed songs, and we just had to get it together. And rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really <b>good</b> <b>fun,</b> because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again." [...] In May and June 2006, Radiohead toured major cities in Europe and North America and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs.|$|E
500|$|Local {{censorship}} boards made numerous {{cuts to the}} film. The long drinking party {{scene was}} cut, as {{was part of a}} 30-second kiss between Tony and Carlotta that opened the film. Censors also cut a line of dialogue delivered by Louise Henry in response to Carlotta's declaration that the Marines had landed: [...] "There'll be atrocities – I want to be first!" [...] The film was never re-released, has never been released in any home video format and is rarely shown on television. Modern critical response has therefore been light, although Tom Milne of Time Out New York dubbed the film a [...] "Delightful screwball parody of the detective thriller...Whale's use of elisions, non-sequiturs and unexpected stresses creates what is virtually a blueprint for the style developed by Robert Altman in and after MASH." [...] The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the film for a 1999 retrospective of Whale's work, found it to be [...] "an amusing trifle, tossed off with considerable wit and skill by Whale" [...] and [...] "pretty <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> if you’re in the mood for a chic, brittle period piece".|$|E

500|$|Conversely, other columnists {{applauded the}} film's comedic theme. A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{imparted}} [...] "it's not as cheekily knowing as the Scream movies or as trashily Grand Guignol as the Evil Dead franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the {{close relationship between}} fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand." [...] C. W. Nevius of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its [...] "funnier than the original." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced [...] "if this is your idea of fun, step right up." [...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as [...] "a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how [...] "it is surprisingly <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> for {{the current crop of}} horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended." [...] Nev Pierce of BBC saw that [...] "it's simple, but effective"; whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution proclaimed that [...] "what Final Destination did for the fear of flying, Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy {{has never really}} done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to really find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it <b>good</b> <b>fun</b> but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E
