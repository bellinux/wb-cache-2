RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes (21 nonsmoking men, aged 36 – 80 years) each received two of three doses of 80, 160, or 240 units inhaled regular insulin, delivered via a clinical Aerodose <b>insulin</b> <b>inhaler,</b> and two of three corresponding doses of 8, 16, or 24 units by subcutaneous injection under isoglycemic clamp conditions on 4 separate study days in an incomplete block design study. Glucose infusion rates (GIRs) and serum insulin concentrations were monitored over the following 8 h. RESULTS — Inhaled insulin exhibited significantly shorter time-to-peak insulin levels (Tmax 77 66 vs. 193 104 min, P 0. 001) and time-to-peak metabolic effects (TGIRmax 240 94 vs. 353 60 min, P 0. 001) compared with subcutaneously injected insulin. Comparison of total insulin absorption (insulin area under the curve [AUC]) versus total metabolic effect (GIR-AUC) from 0 to 8 h (group means) revealed overlapping dose-response relationships for both inhaled and subcutaneous injection treatments. Comparison of slopes revealed no signif-icant differences between the inhaled and subcutaneous injection treatment groups (P 0. 6). No significant differences in either relative bioavailability or relative biopotency were found among doses, indicating a consistent subcutaneous injection–to–inhaled dosing conversion ratio among doses. No serious adverse events or clinically relevant changes in lung function were observed. CONCLUSIONS — The overlapping dose-response curves of inhaled and subcutaneous treatments together with a consistent relative bioavailability and relative biopotency for inhaled insulin across doses suggest that the Aerodose <b>insulin</b> <b>inhaler</b> will deliver a pharmacologically predictable insulin dose to patients with diabetes similar to that observed following subcutane-ous injection...|$|E
40|$|For most {{patients}} with type 1 diabetes, {{the worst part}} of the disease is to tolerate needle after needle, both for glucose measurement and to deliver insulin. In the last two decades, concept of insulin therapy by multiple-dose injection has undergone a miraculous change. Needle-free insulin delivery appeared to be a wonderful approach, and its allure rested in being comfortable and safe. In today&#x 2032;s era, insulin delivery by alternative route is a topic of current interest in the design of drug delivery system. Major global pharmaceutical companies are showing encouraging progress in their attempts to develop alternative insulin delivery technologies. Many such drug delivery systems have been developed for oral, buccal and nasal route. This review article discusses, in brief, the novel and emerging technologies that are in pipeline, including <b>insulin</b> <b>inhalers,</b> <b>insulin</b> spray, insulin pill, insulin analogues, insulin complement, islet cell transplant, implantable insulin pumps and guardian continuous glucose monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|About dollar 1 out {{of every}} dollar 7 spent on health care is related to {{diabetes}} mellitus, {{a leading cause of}} blindness and kidney failure and a strong risk factor for heart disease. Prevalence of the disease has increased by a third among adults in general in the last decade, but intensive therapy has been shown to delay the onset and slow the progression of diabetes-related complications. While insulin therapy remains key in the management of type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2, or insulin-resistant, diabetes encounter insulin administration errors that compromise the quality of insulin delivery. Insulin errors are a major, but modifiable, barrier to dosing accuracy and optimal diabetes control for many patients. Future trends to combat the problem include increased use of <b>insulin</b> <b>inhalers</b> and smaller doses of rapid- or short-acting insulin to supplement longer-acting injections...|$|R

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject * Exercise is known to affect {{absorption}} of other inhaled substances, but so far there are no reports {{on the effect of}} exercise on the absorption of inhaled insulin in humans. What this paper adds * This report is the first to investigate the effect of exercise on the absorption of inhaled insulin. * In this study in healthy volunteers we found that exercise early after dosing increased absorption (15 - 20 %) of inhaled insulin over the first 2 h after start of exercise, with an approximately 30 % increase in maximal insulin concentration, and unchanged overall absorption. Aims To investigate the effect of moderate exercise on the absorption of inhaled insulin. Methods A single-centre, randomized, open-label, three-period cross-over trial was carried out in 12 nonsmoking healthy subjects. A dose of 3. 5 mg inhaled human insulin was administered via a nebulizer and followed in random order by either 1) no exercise (NOEX), 2) 30 min exercise starting immediately after dosing (EX 0), or 3) 30 min exercise starting 30 min after dosing (EX 30). The study was carried out as a 10 h euglycaemic glucose clamp (90 mg dl(- 1) (5. 0 mmol l(- 1))). Results The absorption of insulin over the first 2 h after start of exercise was 16 % increased for EX 0 (ratio (95 %CI) 1. 16 (1. 04, 1. 30), P = 0. 01) and 20 % increased for EX 30 (1. 20 (1. 05, 1. 36), P < 0. 01), both compared with NOEX; the overall insulin absorption during 6 h and 10 h after dosing was not influenced by exercise. The maximum insulin concentration (C(max)) increased by 32 % for EX 0 and 35 % for EX 30 (both P < 0. 01) compared with NOEX, while the time to C(max) was 31 min faster for EX 0 (P < 0. 01), but not significantly different after EX 30, compared with NOEX. Conclusions A significant and clinically relevant increase of insulin absorption over the first 2 h after the beginning of exercise was observed. Until data from studies using the specific <b>insulin</b> <b>inhalers</b> exists, patients using inhaled insulin should be made aware of a potential increased absorption and higher concentration of insulin in connection with exercise...|$|R
40|$|Pfizer {{introduced}} the first <b>insulin</b> dry powder <b>inhaler</b> (Exubera) {{to the market}} in 2006 and terminated the sales {{less than two years}} later, claiming a failing marketing success. It can been questioned whether the real reasons for termination have been given and whether the Exubera system was appropriate for systemic drug delivery through the respiratory tract. Therefore, the performance of the Eubera was tested in comparison with that of a highly efficient dry powder inhaler (Twincer). The results suggest that the delivered fine particle dose from the Exubera may have been insufficiently consistent for a drug like insulin. The results also show that the bioavailability of insulin can be increased from 10 % (with the Exubera) to at least 20 % (with the Twincer) ...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor thesis explores lean {{production}} methods used at manufacturing plant of the Gerresheimer company in Horšovský Týn. The company produces <b>inhalers,</b> <b>insulin</b> pens and other plastic products for medical industry. The {{lean production}} {{is one of}} the modern approaches in production management. It is aimed at increasing in production effeciency and waste minimization. The waste means all activities which do not add any value to the product and rise its costs. The thesis evaluates an activity of the selected company on the basis of specific lean production methods and a long-term analysis of the workplace. It focuses primarily on the 5 S Method. Finally, after the detection of the current conditions, austerity measures are suggested to possible improvements of 5 S Method. There is also a suggestion how to introduce 5 S Method in a small enterprise...|$|R
