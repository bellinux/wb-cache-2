5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland <b>dance</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E

25|$|McWilliams was {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Moorman's Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York (1963–1980), a series of fifteen events that presented experimental art, music, and performance. In 1966, he took part in the 4th festival, held in New York's Central Park, with a work entitled American Picnic, an audience participation piece that addressed the issue of overconsumption.

The country's governor general, Vincent Massey, proclaimed {{the day a}} national holiday and presided over celebrations on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, where the Queen's coronation speech was broadcast and her personal royal standard flown from the Peace Tower. Later, a public concert was held on Parliament Hill and the Governor General hosted a ball at Rideau Hall. In Newfoundland, 90,000 boxes of sweets were given to children, some having theirs delivered by Royal Canadian Air Force drops, and in Quebec, 400,000 people turned out in Montreal, some 100,000 at Jeanne-Mance Park alone.

25|$|A {{period of}} fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, {{followed}} {{the fall of}} the Tang dynasty until China was unified under the Song dynasty. During the Song dynasty, footbinding began to spread among the elite in China, and the practice may have started during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period among female dancers. One story concerns the favorite concubine of the Southern Tang emperor Li Yu who bound her feet into the shape of the crescent moon and performed a lotus <b>dance</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point of her feet ballet-fashion. While originating from dancing, footbinding which became more prevalent during the Song dynasty would also contribute to the decline of dance as an art form. After the Song dynasty, less and less was heard about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers. More severe binding in the subsequent eras also restricted female movement which, together increasing social restrictions placed on women, would eventually led to the virtual elimination of female dancers in later eras. Nevertheless there were still female dance troupes with bound feet formed in the 20th century as novelty acts.|$|E

Fuller sold Pop Idol to Fox in the US, and American Idol quickly became a No.1 rated show making stars of its presenter Ryan Seacrest as well as judges Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell, {{as well as many}} of its performers including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and others. And later the show has featured many more high profiled judges including Ellen DeGeneres, Kara DioGuardi, Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey, and Keith Urban. American Idol has since won many awards and has been credited with originating a new form of reality TV. Fuller has been credited with creating the most valuable TV format in the world with a value of over $8billion made up of revenue from sponsors, merchandising, telephone, music sales, broadcast and advertising sources. Over 30 million viewers saw David Cook win the seventh season of American Idol in May 2008 and when Fuller re-launched the show in 2011 for its 10th season ratings climbed 20% for the finale event. 122.4million votes were cast, a record for a reality TV show. In 2005 Fuller, along with co-creator Nigel Lythgoe, launched So You Think You Can <b>Dance</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Fox network in the USA.
