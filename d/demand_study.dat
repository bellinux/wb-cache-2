40|$|In many {{economic}} settings, individual decisions can {{be viewed}} as a sequential process where a dichotomous choice is followed by a continuous choice. These processes are frequently encountered in consumption <b>demand</b> <b>studies,</b> where the decision of whether or not to consume a particular commodity is followed by the choice of how much to consume. The Heckman two-step approach has been extensively used in estimating these models. Expressions are derived for calculating marginal effects of regressors in dichotomous-continuous models. It is proposed that the marginal effect expressions are incomplete in almost all consumption <b>demand</b> <b>studies</b> that use the Heckman approach. In dichotomous-continuous models, a change in an explanatory variable that is common to both stages of the decision process has two effects: (1) it affects the likelihood of whether the commodity will be consumed; and (2) if the commodity is consumed, it affects the expenditure on that commodity. The first effect has so far been omitted from applied <b>demand</b> <b>studies.</b> The correct marginal effect expressions are derived for single-commodity and multiple-commodity demand models. An application to consumption survey data on 12 food commodities shows that erroneous marginal effect expressions can introduce substantial bias in demand elasticity estimates. ...|$|R

Empirical research on tourism demand modeling and forecasting has attracted increasing attention of scholars {{both within and}} beyond this region.

Comparisons between the two bodies of literature published in two languages show a number of research gaps, such as the diversity and sophistication of the research methodology, rigor of the modeling and forecasting process, and theoretical foundations of demand analysis.

40|$|This study explores and {{demonstrates}} {{the usefulness of}} artificial neural networks (ANNs) as an alternative ap-proach {{to the use of}} multiple regression (MR) in tourism de-mand studies. The study uses Canadian tourism expenditures in the United States as a measure of demand to demonstrate its application. The results revealed that the use of ANNs in tourism <b>demand</b> <b>studies</b> may result in better estimates in terms of prediction bias and accuracy. Further applications of ANNs in the context of tourism demand analysis are needed to establish and confirm the results. Tourism demand analysis forms an integral part of sound decision making regarding investments in both the public and private sectors, as well as in short-term marketing deci-sions. For example, it provides policy implications and is of value to anyone responsible for formulating strategies or pro-moting tourism products and services. Measures of tourism demand are also used to assess the contribution of the tour-ism industry to the economic welfare of the local economy as a whole and to provide a guide to the use and efficient alloca-tion of resources. Therefore, demand represents a key ele-ment in achieving effective development. A review of the literature on tourism <b>demand</b> <b>studies</b> reveals that per capita real income, relative prices, and rela-tive exchange rates are all significant explanatory variables in explaining the determinants of tourism demand. These variables, along with other appropriate explanatory vari-ables, have been used in many <b>demand</b> <b>studies</b> (Crouch 1994...|$|R

The present study aimed to gather information on the prevalence and risk factors for MA in Indonesian patients with type- 2 DM. Methods The <b>DEMAND</b> <b>study</b> was an international open cross-sectional 1 -day survey on microalbuminuria prevalence and its risk factors in type- 2 diabetic patients. This study reports {{the results of the}} Indonesian survey which was performed in primary care practice in Indonesia from June to December 2003. Normotensive or hypertensive adult patients of both genders with type- 2 DM without known proteinuria and/or kidney disease were recruited into the study. Patients with known pregnancy, having menstruation or acute fever were excluded. A single urinary albumin/creatinine test was carried out in all patients. Results A total of 770 patients were eligible for analysis. Approximately 80 % of the patients had micro-/ macroalbuminuria, while renal insufficiency was detected in about 36 % of the 433 patients with available data. Target HbA 1 c (< 7 %) was reached by only 40 % of the 118 patients who had HbA 1 c values. Most antidiabetic treatment prescribed was oral (82 %), while insulin was used by only 14 % of patients. Goal BP (< 130 / 80 mm Hg) was achieved in only 9 % of patients. The frequency of patients receiving antihypertensives was 52 %, statins 18 %, and aspirin 26 %. The most frequently used antihypertensives were RAS blockers (45 %), while diuretics were used in 7 % of the patients. The family history of DM was found in 43 % of patients, the history of retinopathy in 16 %, diabetic foot 9 %, and history of smoking in 20 % of patients. Conclusion These data reveal that Indonesia {{has one of the highest}} frequencies of silent diabetic kidney disease seen in any national group in the global <b>DEMAND</b> <b>Study.</b> Early detection, monitoring of vascular complications, and more aggressive multifactorial treatment aiming at renal and vascular protection are urgently needed for Indonesian patients with type- 2 diabetes.

40|$|In recent years, ferrets {{have become}} a popular animal model in {{biomedical}} research. However, they are relatively new in the laboratory environment and therefore not much is known about adequate housing and treatment of these animals in experimental environments. An important part of experimental housing is the enrichments offered to the laboratory animals. In order to determine adequate enrichments for ferrets in laboratory conditions, a pilot consumer <b>demand</b> <b>study</b> was designed by M. L. Reijgwart in 2013. In this study, ferrets had to push a weighted door {{in order to reach}} various enrichments. The amount of weight the animals were prepared to push reflects their motivation to reach the different enrichments, which could be used to determine their preferences. However, the amount of weight the ferrets pushed for food (a necessity) was not significantly different from the amount they would push for an empty room. In this study, six different setups were designed {{in order to try to}} find an explanation for the high control results. The setups were divided in purely diagnostic and problem-solving setups.

40|$|The income {{velocity}} of money declined sharply in Sweden between the 1870 's and {{the outbreak of}} World War I. This decline is explained by a monetization process. An account {{of this process is}} given focusing on (a) the growth of commercial banking, (b) changes in wage contracts and in labor markets, and (c) changes in exchange arrangements in the markets for goods. A number of proxy measures of the spreading use of money are presented and included in regressions on velocity. The influence of the monetization variables is compared to the effects of the standard explanatory variables in money <b>demand</b> <b>studies,</b> that is, of real income and interest rates. The econometric results support the view that monetization variables significantly contributed to the fall in velocity.

In the model, it is assumed that there is a linear and additive demand function relating land-use variables in a zone (such as jobs, schools, or households) with parking demand. Further, the parking activity associated with each land-use variable is assumed to have a unique parking accumulation profile. Surveys were conducted to determine these profiles. A unitgraph, which is defined as the parking accumulation profile per parking activity, was constructed for each landuse variable.
