25|$|Some nouns take no {{ligature}} morpheme; these mostly denote {{parts of}} the body (e.g. bila 'mouth', napa 'tooth', kakma 'nose') or kinship (e.g. lakra 'opposite-sex sibling'), although there is only an imperfect correlation between membership of this morphological class and semantic <b>inalienability</b> (see also relationals below).|$|E
25|$|Alienation was {{not always}} possible, and {{sometimes}} {{the permission of the}} lord was required. It is the opinion of Pollock and Maitland that {{in the middle of the}} 13th century the tenant enjoyed a large power of disposing of his tenement by act inter vivos, though this was subject to some restraints in favor of his lord. Other opinions have been expressed. Coke regarded the English tradition as one of ancient liberty dictated by custom. The tenant had relative freedom to alienate all or part of his estate. Blackstone was of a differing conclusion. The “learning of feuds” started with the <b>inalienability</b> of the fief as a starting point. Pollock and Maitland believe Coke’s opinion to be the more valid one. Both views may have been true. Modern scholars may have given more weight to the written and declared law of the Normans than existed in reality.|$|E

2500|$|Bernd Heine {{argues that}} {{linguistic}} change {{is responsible for}} this language-specific variability in categorization. This is because [...] "rather than being a semantically defined category, <b>inalienability</b> {{is more likely to}} constitute a morphosyntactic or morphophonological entity, one that owes its existence to the fact that certain nouns happened to be left out when a new pattern for marking attributive possession arose." [...] Under this view, nouns that are [...] "ignored" [...] by a new marking pattern come to form a separate noun class.|$|E
2500|$|In linguistics, {{inalienable}} possession (abbreviated [...] ) {{is a type}} {{of possession}} [...] in which a noun is obligatorily possessed by its possessor. Nouns or nominal affixes in an inalienable possession relationship cannot exist independently or be [...] "alienated" [...] from their possessor. For example, a hand implies [...] "(someone's) hand", even if it is severed from the whole body. Likewise, a father implies [...] "(someone's) father". Inalienable nouns include body parts (e.g. leg, which is necessarily [...] "someone's leg"), kinship terms (e.g. mother), and part-whole relations (e.g. top). [...] Many languages reflect this distinction, but they vary in the way they mark inalienable possession. Cross-linguistically, <b>inalienability</b> correlates with many morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties.|$|E
2500|$|Marcel Mauss wrote The Gift. [...] He was {{a pioneer}} in the study of gift exchange. Mauss was {{concerned}} only with the relations formed by the circulation of things that men produce, and not with the relations that men form while they produce things. He is concerned, in particular, with why people give gifts, and why they feel the obligation to make a return. [...] In fact, he contended that <b>inalienability</b> is based on or legitimized by the belief that there is present in the object a power, a spirit, a spiritual reality that binds it to the giver, and which accompanies the object wherever it goes. [...] This spirit then wishes to return to its source the original giver.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout history, {{human organs}} have {{acquired}} different characteristics, acting as both alienable and inalienable possessions {{depending on the}} temporal and spatial context. Alienable possessions are objects that can be bought and sold, while inalienable possessions are things that must be kept due to their relationships with an individual's identity and origins. During the 17th century, human organs were represented as inalienable possessions, that is, objects {{that could not be}} given away in exchange and their use by the medical profession was associated with violent actions. However, once the medical value of bodies was recognized, there was an increase in its commodification which was not legally acknowledged until the Anatomy Act, which prohibited the selling of bodies, was signed in 1832. In reality, consensus over the sale of bodies and body parts had not been reached, and as Locke as argued, [...] "competition over corpses and body parts existed because ideas about their value and beliefs about their alienability varied among contenders". Currently, different representations of organs and other body parts coexist blurring the lines between alienability and <b>inalienability.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the German Enlightenment, Hegel gave {{a highly}} {{developed}} treatment of this <b>inalienability</b> argument.

50|$|Some nouns take no {{ligature}} morpheme; these mostly denote {{parts of}} the body (e.g. bila mouth, napa tooth, kakma nose) or kinship (e.g. lakra opposite-sex sibling), although there is only an imperfect correlation between membership of this morphological class and semantic <b>inalienability</b> (see also relationals below).|$|E
50|$|All nouns {{fall into}} one of two subclasses using {{different}} constructions for possession. Categories can roughly be defined semantically into alienable and inalienable possession. <b>Inalienability,</b> semantically can be described as the relationship held between an animate possessor and an aspect of this possessor which can’t exist independently of that being.|$|E

50|$|These two {{decisions}} show a fluctuating {{perspective on}} the question, though it does not endorse {{the rejection of the}} rule of <b>inalienability</b> of the Crown by the Orleanists but its relativity: they do not reject it because they believe the Crown can only go to Orleans, but it becomes relative in the house of Orleans as its transmission depends on the decisions of those who inherited it.|$|E
50|$|Vinelott J {{held that}} the estate was to be kept intact as {{endowment}} capital on trust for the Labour Party’s purposes, and therefore was void for infringing the beneficiary principle and the rule against <b>inalienability.</b> The Re Recher analysis (that donations take effect as accretions to the group’s funds, subject to the contract that exists between the members) could not be applied. Referring to Re Denley's he continued.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inalienability</b> of the Crown (or {{unavailability}} of the Crown): {{the crown}} {{is not the}} personal property of the king. He cannot appoint his successor, renounce the crown, or abdicate. This principle arose circa 1419, {{in anticipation of the}} Treaty of Troyes, which sought to exclude the Dauphin Charles from the succession. The succession can no longer be regulated by the king, and would rely only on the force of custom.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{definitions}} of <b>inalienability</b> include non-relinquishability, non-salability, and non-transferability. This concept {{has been recognized}} by libertarians as being central {{to the question of}} voluntary slavery, which Murray Rothbard dismissed as illegitimate and even self-contradictory. Stephan Kinsella argues that [...] "viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent with - indeed, implied by - the libertarian non-aggression principle. Under this principle, only the initiation of force is prohibited; defensive, restitutive, or retaliatory force is not." ...|$|E
50|$|The National Trust Acts {{grant the}} trust the unique {{statutory}} power to declare land inalienable. This prevents {{the land from}} being sold or mortgaged against the trust's wishes without special parliamentary procedure. The <b>inalienability</b> of trust land was over-ridden by Parliament {{in the case of}} proposals to construct a section of the Plympton bypass through the park at Saltram, {{on the grounds that the}} road proposal had been known about before the park at Saltram was declared inalienable.|$|E
5000|$|Nouns {{pertaining}} to kinship and body parts are always classified as inalienable, {{but there are}} some terms that dont fall under either of these umbrellas that must be classified as inalienable such as the noun [...] "home." [...] Various affixes are used to denote <b>inalienability</b> and different affixes are used to differentiate animate/inanimate and singular/plural. Additionally, when a term requires possession but the possessor is unclear or unknown it is marked with prefix that indicates an indefinite possessor.|$|E
50|$|Born in Bălcești, Vâlcea County, he {{attended}} the Law faculties of the Saint Sava College and of the University of Paris; his thesis was on the <b>inalienability</b> of property gained through dowries. During the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the Provisional Government assigned him as commissioner of Buzău County. On 8 September, he corresponded with his brother, {{a leader of the}} revolution, and took part in the public burning of Regulamentul Organic. He was arrested in Bucharest and subsequently departed for Ottoman-administered Constanța.|$|E
50|$|According to them, as {{the heir}} to the throne {{receives}} the crown by heredity, primogeniture and male collaterality, any designation is therefore unnecessary since the king is in any case the eldest of the Capetians. In this logic, any designation is void due to the <b>inalienability</b> of the crown: the Count of Chambord cannot dispose of, he could not appoint an heir, and if he did, it was both unnecessary and could only be a simple, personal opinion without legal effect.|$|E
50|$|Hence, at {{any point}} in time only one person has the {{potential}} of fulfilling all the conditions of French kingship — the chief of the Capetian dynasty. His non-fulfillment of the only remaining condition, Catholicism, will not necessarily exclude him, such being contrary to the <b>inalienability</b> principle. By not being a Catholic, what he actually does is to delay the full acquisition of his royal powers, which would be exercised by other persons, as happened during the Protestantism of Henry IV (1589-1593).|$|E
