In 2007, he received $60 million in his Swiss bank account through offshore companies under his name. He {{was reported to have}} estates in Surrey, West End of London, Normandy, Manhattan (a condominium in Belaire Apartments), and Dubai, as well as a 16th-century chateau in Normandy. In Britain, he used a common legal device—the purchase of property through nominees with no family link to the Bhuttos. His homes in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad are called Bilawal <b>House</b> <b>I,</b> Bilawal House II, and Zardari House respectively.|$|E

25|$|Wright's {{projects}} {{during this}} period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the Winslow House, combined Sullivanesque ornamentation {{with the emphasis on}} simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), Heller House (1896), Rollin Furbeck House (1897), and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the Dutch Colonial Revival style Bagley House (1894), Tudor Revival style Moore <b>House</b> <b>I</b> (1895), and Queen Anne style Charles E. Roberts House (1896).While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} <b>house</b> <b>I</b> thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the <b>House.</b> <b>I</b> admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E

He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E
500|$|In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On {{the subject}} of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, [...] "My father wrote her a formal letter {{inviting}} her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her <b>house</b> ... <b>I</b> was so nervous. In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on." [...] In 1958, when Rice was sixteen, her father moved the family to north Texas, purchasing their first home in Richardson. Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.|$|E
500|$|Rit {{struggled}} to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and [...] "the Georgia man" [...] came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, [...] "You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my <b>house,</b> <b>I</b> will split his head open." [...] Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.|$|E

In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming {{to bring back the}} flavour of Ian Fleming's original Bond novels. Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean <b>house,</b> <b>I</b> should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E

By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Anderson was by {{no means}} alone in her late {{emergence}} onto the literary stage: Geordie Williamson notes that several of Anderson's Australian female contemporaries including Elizabeth Jolley, Olga Masters, and Amy Witting did not begin publishing until they had reached retirement age. He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances, including [...] "the demands of family and work, lack of financial independence, an indifferent publishing environment." [...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When I was married, and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was the <b>house)</b> ... <b>I</b> never craved {{to be out in the}} workplace." [...] He suggests that, as well as adverse material circumstances, Anderson's career was delayed, and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain [...] "diffidence regarding her gifts." [...] In her own essay entitled [...] "Starting Too Late," [...] Anderson complains that [...] "they are unwilling servants, those skills we learn too late."

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day.

[...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
