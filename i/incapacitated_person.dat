40|$|The {{amount of}} medical {{research}} with persons who lack decision-making capacity is rapidly increasing, {{but in most}} states it takes place without clear legal authority. In addition to creating significant liability risks for researchers and persons who provide consent on behalf of incapacitated subjects, the lack of explicit legal standards means that few, if any, safeguards exist to protect <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> 2 ̆ 7 rights and welfare. Previous efforts {{to close the gap}} between clinical reality and legal requirements have failed in part because they have not provided a coherent or persuasive ethical justification for permitting this research. This Article seeks to fill that void by proposing a new way of thinking about the ethics of research with <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons,</b> grounded in a long-term, systemic approach to risk-benefit assessment. This approach explains why it is ultimately in <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> 2 ̆ 7 best interests to be governed by a policy that permits them to be enrolled in research without their personal authorization [...] even if such a policy puts them at risk of participating in studies that, when viewed in isolation, may involve more burdens than benefits. Unlike other approaches, the framework developed here does not depend on false analogies between participating in research and receiving medical treatment, or dubious claims about family members 2 ̆ 7 inherent authority or <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> 2 ̆ 7 obligations to society. Because the proposed framework directly responds to the criticism that research with <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> is a form of exploitation, it may increase the likelihood that proposals to authorize this research will actually be adopted. It also has important implications for both how laws governing research with <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> should be structured, and the roles and responsibilities of surrogate decision makers...|$|R

5000|$|This {{disability}} often {{arises from}} minority, mental incapacity, {{or lack of}} access to counsel. Consequently every application to the court on behalf of a minor, a mentally <b>incapacitated</b> <b>person,</b> or a person detained without access to an attorney, who does not have a legal guardian or someone authorized to act on his or her behalf with a power of attorney, must be made through a next friend (prochain ami, prochain amy, or proximus amicus). A minor frequently defends a suit not by a next friend but by a guardian ad litem, often appointed by the court with jurisdiction over the case or by a court with probate jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Such an {{approach}} {{differs from that}} taken with minors, where the other contracting party need not know {{they are dealing with}} a minor, in order to be bound. Whilst there is no absolute standard for a party to be deemed capable of contracting, they must at least know the principles of what they are contracting for, to legally bind themselves. As with minors however, an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>person</b> is bound by statute regarding contracts for necessaries. This obligation falls under Section 7 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, assuming the role of Section 3 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Those incapacitated may also choose to ratify a contract at a later date, if their mental incapacity ends.|$|E

This plays in with the [...] "suspicion" [...] system; a bar beside the health meter on the HUD represents how much suspicion 47 garners. There are multiple ways to blend in more effectively; for example, the player can make sure to carry an AK-47 assault rifle while disguised as a Russian soldier. Despite the usage of a uniform, being nearer to fellow guards will simply increase the suspicion as they would have an opportunity to more closely examine 47. Also, running, climbing and being in restricted places are other ways to garner concern.|$|E

50|$|A {{date rape}} drug, also {{referred}} to as a predator drug, is any drug that is an incapacitating agent which, when administered to another <b>person,</b> <b>incapacitates</b> the <b>person</b> and renders them vulnerable to a drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), including rape. The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim consumes a recreational drug such as alcohol administered surreptitiously. The most common form of DFSA is alcohol-related, with the victim in most cases consuming the alcohol voluntarily. Other date rape drugs include rohypnol, ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).|$|R
50|$|The legal {{guardianship}} {{of the person}} of the monarch (with the corresponding power to administer the private property of the sovereign) does not necessarily rest with the regent. However, if the none of the prospective guardians provided for in the statute exist, then, also according to the statute, the regent becomes the guardian of the sovereign. Accordingly, during a regency, the regent is the person invested with the royal authority, that discharges the royal functions on behalf of the monarch. The guardian, on the other hand, has the legal custody of the sovereign (who is either a minor or an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>person)</b> and the duty to care for the monarch's personal well being. The two roles {{may or may not be}} combined.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, however, {{deficiencies}} in [...] "second-generation" [...] advance directives were also soon noted. Primarily, individuals faced problems {{similar to those}} that handicapped living wills - knowing what to tell the proxy decision-maker about one's wishes in a meaningful way. Studies found most of what appointed proxies are told is too vague for meaningful interpretation. In the absence of meaningful information, family and physician [...] "guesswork" [...] is found to be inaccurate as much as 76% of the time. While a study comparing next-of-kin decisions on behalf of an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>person,</b> (who later recovered) found that these surrogates chose correctly 68% of the time overall. [...] This continuing problem {{led to the development of}} what might be called [...] "third generation" [...] advance directives.|$|E
5000|$|In law, a ward {{is someone}} {{placed under the}} {{protection}} of a legal guardian. The wardship jurisdiction is an ancient jurisdiction derived from the Crown's duty as parens patriae to protect his/her subject, and particularly those unable to look after themselves. In the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms, the Queen as parens patriae is mother for all the children in her realms [...] A court may take responsibility for the legal protection of an individual, usually either a child or <b>incapacitated</b> <b>person,</b> in which case the ward is known as a ward of the court or a ward of the state. However, the House of Lords in the case of Re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) held that the Queen has no parens patriae jurisdiction with regard to mentally handicapped adults.|$|E
40|$|What happens {{culturally}} when persons meet in profes-sional care contexts? In {{clinical and}} community settings, there is, at minimum, a professional nurse or {{other health care}} professional relating to a client who may be an individual, a family, or a community. Usually, there is an assumption that the nurse has care knowledge and skills that are needed by the client. In the best scenario, that conclusion should only be reached {{through the process of}} negotiation that includes the client (or a surrogate representative in the case of young chil-dren or <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons)</b> and the health care profession-als who are involved. The interface among the persons in the setting almost always will involve some cultural differences, unless the care receivers and caregivers share similar lifeways and worldviews.

40|$|There {{are some}} general {{approaches}} to assessment of economic losses associated with mortality and morbidity. However these methods are utilitarian and population is considered as labor forces. That is why <b>incapacitated</b> <b>persons</b> are not frequently included in such calculations. Authors offer to take Russian methodology {{as a basis}} and correct it taking into account a fact that population {{is not only a}} present day labor forces. In prospect an individual is able to renew labor forces. Other words not only future work but “future children” should be considered in economic assessment of losses associated with child mortality. Besides individuals not only “produce” but “consume”. Growth of consumption increases demand and leads to GDP growth. In the same time expenditures increase production volume more than amount of expenditures. Ripple effect activates – ability of expenditures to induce returns growth more than expenditures associated with this growth. ...|$|R
