40|$|The author {{examines}} some of {{the issues}} and controversies that arise when facilities with noxious environmental, social, or <b>economic</b> <b>qualities</b> (LULUs, or locally unwanted land uses) locate in communities. A taxonomy of LULUs, based on economic growth features, is developed and the effects of five specific kinds of LULUs: interstate highways; large dams; medium-security and maximum-security prisons; commercial nuclear power plants; and gambling casinos, are described. The author uses quasi-experimental control-group methods to assess the economic impacts of these facilities on US counties during the period 1972 – 94. It is shown that few real negative effects can in fact be attributed to LULUs. However, only interstate highways measurably stimulate aggregate employment. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Understanding the {{distribution}} characteristics of arable land in Yunnan Province is of significant importance to make scientific decisionsto use {{and improve the}} quality of arable land. In this study, {{the distribution}} characteristics of the arable land grade including 129 counties were analyzed based on the accomplishment of cultivated land classification in Yunnan Province. The results showed that the average <b>economic</b> <b>quality</b> composite grade was 2. 9, in a range of 1 to 13, which means that the <b>economic</b> <b>quality</b> of arable landof Yunnan Province is relatively lower. In excellent zone, the grade ranges from 1 to 10, and the average grade is 2. 4. In good zone, it ranges from 1 ~ 13, and the average grade is 3. 1. In medium zone, it ranges from 1 ~ 12, and the average value is 3. 2. In poor zone, it ranges from 1 ~ 11, and the average is 3. In worse zone, it ranges from 1 ~ 10, and the average is 2. 2. The middle and poor arable land has the largest area, which concentrated in the middle and poor zones and dominantly influenced the average grade in the whole province. This research will serve as a reference forarable landpolicy making in the future, especiallyon apace arrangement optimization, quality improvement and ecology environment protection in Yunnan Province...|$|E

40|$|Theoretically, a {{shortage}} of males in a local marriage market may influence the formation, quality, and trajectory of unmarried parent relationships. To test these hypotheses, I combine city-level sex ratio data from the U. S. census with microdata on unmarried couples who recently had a child from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. A shortage of men in a marriage market is associated with lower relationship quality for unmarried parents. Male shortages are associated with lower rates of marriage following a nonmarital birth, {{in part because of}} the mediating influence of relationship quality. A shortage of men is not significantly related to the <b>economic</b> <b>quality</b> of male, nonmarital childbearing partners...|$|E
