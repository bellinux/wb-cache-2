40|$|In {{order to}} improve the direct {{injection}} scheme of the Riken Nd-YAK-laser driven ion source into a RFQ rf-accelerator [1], several basic methods have been investigated and compared, in order to transform the initially divergent ion beam into a convergent one, needed for matching the high current (100 mA C 6 +) ion beam at an energy of 100 keV to a RFQ. From the point of power supplies and break down characteristics, the simplest solution is a decelerating electrostatic lens [2], with the <b>decelerating</b> <b>electrode</b> operated on ion source potential. Due to the strong divergence of the ion beam after acceleration, this lens will be filled to {{more than half of}} the aperture, which causes strong aberrations. Therefore, we also investigated the use of an accelerating potential on the lens electrode. This reduces significantly the filling of the lens and the emittance growth is only a factor of 3, as compared to the decelerating lens with a factor of 30 ! We have been looking also into a magnetic matching system, which can match the ion beam to the RFQ with virtually no emittance growth. By increasing the length of the magnetic solenoid and reducing the axial field strength, still good matching is obtained, however, at the expense of an emittance growth, which seems to be proportional to the length...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrostatic}} deceleration {{system was}} developed for the injection of the 60 -keV mass-separated ion beam at the ISOLDE facility at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) into a new segmented radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) ion guide at the ISOLTRAP experiment. A detailed computer simulation of the ion motion through the electrostatic <b>decelerating</b> and focusing <b>electrodes</b> into the RFQ ion guide was carried out. A complete decelerating structure was designed and built using the parameters extracted from the simulation, as was {{the first half of}} a segmented RFQ ion guide for capturing and cooling the decelerated beam. With experiments conducted partly with the ISOLTRAP apparatus at CERN and partly with our apparatus at McGill University, we were able to show that the decelerating structure can in fact inject a beam into the RFQ ion guide. The measured transmission rate of 15 to 30 percent is in agreement with the value that was predicted by the simulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} Ion beam associated with the operation of Field Emission Electric Propulsion thrusters Is presented. The objective oft be study Is to develop a computational tool capable of predicting the effects or thruster configuration parameters (geometry, voltage distribution between the electrodes) on thruster performance (beam divergence, ion exhaust velocity). A two-dimensional, steady model bas been adopted. The electric potential, electric field and the trajectories of the emitted particles are evaluated In a domain which extends from the emitter tip {{to a point where}} either beam neutralization takes place or the electric field becomes sufficiently low to assume that the trajectories can be reasonably approximated as straight lines. A simple emission model has been assumed, neglecting the detailed, microscopic description of the physical emission mechanism. The electric field Is evaluated by a finite element scheme; boundary conditions are provided by an auxUiary technique based on the placement of fictitious charges In proximity to the electrode surfaces. The beam Is simulated through a discrete number of charged particles; the effects or the associated space charge density distribution on the electric field Is also considered. The results of the simulations or typical thruster configurations are presented and discussed. The need to take the space charge effects Into account to attain a sufficiently accurate solution Is Indicated. Neutralization at a finite distance must be taken Into account to fully appreciate the effects or different voltage distributions between the electrodes, and It Is shown to Increase beam divergence. The capabUity or a thruster configuration with an additional, <b>decelerating</b> neutral <b>electrode</b> to focus the ion beam Is also Investigated...|$|R
