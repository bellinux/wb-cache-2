5|$|The {{relationship}} between Hague and Brandle started to <b>go</b> <b>bad</b> in late 1931, during construction of Jersey City Medical Center, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who {{was building a}} backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle's card-file system, by which he kept track of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan's workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved.|$|E

500|$|Little Mix co-wrote [...] "DNA" [...] with TMS and Iain James. TMS {{developed}} the song's guitar riff, drum beats and synths. It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel Aslet and Ben Collier. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, USA, and Tom Coyne {{was responsible for}} the song's mastering. [...] "DNA" [...] was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy. In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen, Perrie Edwards explained: [...] "When a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy. That's what 'DNA' is about." [...] The group wrote [...] "DNA" [...] as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love. It was also written as a song about obsession. Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, Leigh-Anne Pinnock mentioned: [...] "It's not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes when things <b>go</b> <b>bad</b> you do go like that, you stalk them on Facebook..." ...|$|E

Those officers, should things <b>go</b> <b>bad</b> for them, are vastly outnumbered by {{a group of people who}} have already voiced their unhappiness with the police." ...|$|E
2500|$|Credit/default: Default risk is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} borrower’s inability to meet interest payment obligations on time. [...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus. A key indicator of a particular security’s default risk is its credit rating. Different tranches within the ABS are rated differently, with senior classes of most issues receiving the highest rating, and subordinated classes receiving correspondingly lower credit ratings. Almost all mortgages, including reverse mortgages, and student loans, are now insured by the government, meaning that taxpayers are {{on the hook for}} any of these loans that <b>go</b> <b>bad</b> even if the asset is massively over-inflated. In other words, there are no limits or curbs on over-spending, or the liabilities to taxpayers.|$|E
