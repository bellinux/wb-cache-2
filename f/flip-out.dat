2500|$|Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) powered 60-foot Neoplan USA and {{diesel-electric}} hybrid New Flyer articulated buses are {{used on the}} SL4 and SL5 services for greater capacity than that provided by standard buses. Standard (40-foot, non-articulated) diesel and CNG buses are used at night and during snowstorms. As with SL1 and SL2, these buses are wheelchair ramp-equipped, using kneeling bus technology and a <b>flip-out</b> ramp. (See MBTA accessibility for more information.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The PG-70 was {{inserted}} into the muzzle of the launcher and fired using a simple percussion cap firing a [...] cartridge. Three ring-shaped stabilising fins were mounted on a tube that extended down the outside of barrel of the launcher, avoiding the need for <b>flip-out</b> fins or other solutions that would fit inside the barrel. The round was [...] long and weighed [...] It fired at a muzzle velocity of [...] and had a maximum effective range of about [...] A trained two-man crew could fire 4 to 6 rounds per minute.|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen also employs tapping harmonics. [...] He {{holds the}} pick between {{his thumb and}} middle finger, which leaves his index finger free for tapping, and also makes for easy {{transitions}} between picking and tapping. In support of his two-handed tapping techniques, Van Halen also holds a patent for a <b>flip-out</b> support device that attaches {{to the rear of}} the electric guitar. This device enables the user to play the guitar in a manner similar to the piano by orienting the face of the guitar upward instead of forward.|$|E

2500|$|From South Station to Silver Line Way the Neoplan USA AN460LF {{dual-mode}} 60 foot {{articulated buses}} on these services operate as trolleybuses, powered by overhead electrical wire, to avoid generating internal combustion fumes in the tunnel, and continue on thereafter on diesel power, which {{is converted to}} electrical power to run the same electric motors used when running on overhead power. These buses provide higher capacity than standard 40-foot buses. Both the rear and center wheels are powered by electric motors, which permits these buses to continue operation even through snow. These buses are wheelchair ramp–equipped, using kneeling bus technology and a <b>flip-out</b> ramp. (See MBTA accessibility for more information.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional <b>flip-out</b> windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline Six-cylinder , , three V8 engines ( [...] , a 1975-only option, a [...] and a [...] ) for 1976 only, were offered. Mated to a three-speed automatic, 3-speed manual or 4-speed – V8s only – Which remained the norm {{through the end of the}} decade (and the end of the rear-wheel drive X platform).|$|E

50|$|The TALD was an {{expendable}} glide {{vehicle with}} a square fuselage, <b>flip-out</b> wings, and three tail control surfaces. A digital {{flight control system}} could be programmed to conduct various speed or manoeuvering changes during flight. The missile could be launched from 12,200 metres (40,000 ft), at which height it had a range of up to 126 km - a low altitude range reduced this to 26 km.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 Lockheed started {{development}} of the Lockheed YF-12 interceptor, as a lower-cost replacement for the F-108. The GAR-9/ASG-18 were moved to this project. The F-12 would have featured four flip-open internal weapons bays on the chines behind the cockpit, one of these filled with electronics. The F-12B bays were {{too small for the}} GAR-9, so the GAR-9B was developed with <b>flip-out</b> fins to reduce its diameter. It weighed 365 kg.|$|E

50|$|As {{one of the}} originators of today's {{technical}} street-skating, Lotti brought several {{tricks to}} the forefront of skateboarding such as the frontside bluntside. He also invented the backside tailslide <b>flip-out</b> and the Bigspin. The Bigspin was done by skateboarders before Lotti but the catchy name caught on. The name was derived from a Californian lottery at the time with the name Bigspin. The person who named the trick the Bigspin saw Lotti do one and chose the name because his last name sounds like the word lottery.|$|E
50|$|The Pentax K-70 is a 24 {{megapixel}} compact APS-C digital SLR camera {{announced by}} Ricoh on June 8, 2016. In {{contrast to the}} previously introduced APS-C flagship K-3 II, it includes a flash, <b>flip-out</b> display and built-in WiFi. In common with that camera, the K-70 is capable of Pixel Shift Resolution images, which provide higher colour resolution and require the camera to be stationary.

5000|$|Released in {{the first}} wave of Transformers: Armada toys, Megatron was {{packaged}} with the Mini-Con Leader-1 (Barrel in Japan), who transformed into a missile truck and a laser-pistol that Megatron could wield. Packed with the largest number of action features and Mini-activated gimmicks in the entire line, Megatron featured multiple extending and <b>flip-out</b> platforms on his shoulders that the small robots could mount on and a ramp and claw to grab them and a [...] "prison cell" [...] in his legs. Plugging a Mini-Con into his turret activates a twin firing missile launcher with electronic sounds, while mounting the Mini-Con on the turrets other Powerlinx point activates machine gun noises. His left robot mode arm features a <b>flip-out</b> knife blade that does not require a Mini-Con to activate, and his main turret cannon fires pressure-activated missiles accompanied by electronic noises. His missiles and Leader-1 can also store in his shoulders in robot mode. Finally, Megatron features an additional transformation that involves rotating his tank turret around to the front of his robot mode; by cranking a hidden handle on his midriff, the turret spins and unleashes a stream of electronic noises, and even speech, as Megatron intones [...] "Decepticons, attack!" ...|$|E

The round was 425 mm long and weighed 1.6 kg. It fired at a muzzle velocity of 40 m/s and had a maximum effective range of about 75 m. A trained two-man crew could fire 4 to 6 rounds per minute.|$|E
5000|$|Gibson also {{produced}} Kalamazoo bass amplifiers. The tube-driven Bass 30 and Bass 50 were both {{equipped with a}} pair of 10" [...] Jensen speakers. These came in different confiurations over time: in one version the speakers were side by side with a <b>flip-out</b> control panel that became flush with the back of the cabinet when not in use; a vertical speaker configuration with a flip out panel; and a vertical configuration with a wood finish slanted panel like the guitar amps. The final models were simply labeled [...] "Bass" [...] without a number. The last run was apparently solid state instead of tube driven.|$|E
50|$|All models lacked {{memory card}} {{extension}} slots, though the Flip UltraHD(2 hr) could record to a storage device via FlipPort. Models could {{be connected to}} a computer with a <b>flip-out</b> USB connector, {{without the need for}} a USB cable. Flip Cameras recorded monaural sound, and used a simple clip-navigation interface with a D-pad and two control buttons which allowed for viewing of recorded videos, starting and stopping recording, and digital zoom. The third and final generation of Flip UltraHD cameras retailed for $149.99 and $199.99 for 4GB (1 hour) and 8GB (2 hour) models respectively, incorporated digital stabilization, and increased the frame rate from 30 to 60 frames per second. With FlipPort, users can plug in external accessories.|$|E
50|$|Home theater seating {{consists}} of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies {{in a home}} theater. Some home theater seats have a cup holder built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has movie-theater-style chairs like those seen in a movie cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with <b>flip-out</b> footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, tactile transducers for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home theater seating {{tends to be more}} comfortable than seats in a public cinema.|$|E
5000|$|The Hasbro/Tiger Electronics VCamNow is {{a digital}} tapeless {{camcorder}} targeted to children. It is {{designed as a}} complement to the VideoNow series of personal video players, and comes with editing software (the VideoNow Media Wizard) allowing users to create VideoNow videos on Microsoft Windows systems.

50|$|Coach Dana X. Bible {{thought that}} Jack (Jackrabbit) Crain helped lay the {{foundation}} for the University of Texas at Austin Longhorn's rise from mediocrity to preeminence in the late 1930s. In the game between the Longhorns and Razorbacks in October 1939, Crain an unknown sophomore, ran a quick kick back to help UT later score from seven yards out. Late in the game with only under 30 seconds to play, Crain caught a <b>flip-out</b> pass and ran 67 yards untouched and scored a touchdown to tie the game at 13-13. Finally, as the clock ran out Crain kicked the extra point himself for the 14-13 win. This game became known as the Renaissance Game in Texas football history and the win is credited for revitalizing the football program once again. At the University of Texas, Crain set records that still stand today.|$|E
