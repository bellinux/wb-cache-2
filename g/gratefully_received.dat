Haug's reconstruction had also other attractive aspects that seemed to make the religion more compatible with nineteenth-century Enlightenment, as he attributed to Zoroaster a rejection of rituals and of worship of entities other than the supreme deity.|$|E

40|$|The Botanic Gardens Micropropagation News is {{published}} by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in association with Botanic Gardens Conservation International. It was established in 1990 as {{it was felt that}} there was an absence of a suitable journal for publications relating to the micropropagation of rare and endangered species. Many of the species worked on in botanic gardens and similar institutes are not of interest to the general tissue-culture journals. In addition, shortage of material often makes replicated trials difficult. Information relating to the propagation of rare species is difficult to find, and the Newsletter has proved very useful in facilitating the exchange of ideas and protocols. Since it began, researchers from 18 countries have submitted over 40 articles on a diverse range of species. Shorter notices and announcements of meetings are also included, and the section on recent references has proved very popular. Approximately 300 copies are mailed worldwide in addition to being sent out with BGCI News. The last two issues have also been available on the World Wide Web at [URL] Any articles concerning micropropagation work on rare and endangered species would be very <b>gratefully</b> <b>receive...</b>|$|R

40|$|Compound strong {{gravitational}} lensing {{is a rare}} phenomenon, but {{a handful}} of such lensed systems are likely to be discovered in forthcoming surveys. In this work, we use a double SIS lens model to analytically understand how the properties of the system impact image multiplicity for the final source. We find that up to six images of a background source can form, but only if the second lens is multiply imaged by the first and the Einstein radius of the second lens is comparable to, but does not exceed that of the first. We then build a model of compound lensing masses in the Universe, using SIE lenses, and assess how the optical depth for multiple imaging by a galaxy-galaxy compound lens varies with source redshift. For a source redshift of 4, we find optical depths of 6 × 10 ^- 6 for multiple imaging and 5 × 10 ^- 8 for multiplicity of 6 or greater. We find that extreme magnifications are possible, with magnifications of 100 or more for 6 × 10 ^- 9 of z= 10 sources with 0. 1 kpc radii. We show some of the image configurations that can be generated by compound lenses, and demonstrate that they are qualitatively different to those generated by single-plane lenses; dedicated compound lens finders will be necessary if these systems are to be discovered in forthcoming surveys.

5000|$|Chamberlain was {{in charge}} of the war from his base in the Colonial Office. The Prime Minister rubber-stamped his decisions. [...] Boer regular army units outnumbered the British 3:1 on the front lines and quickly besieged the towns of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. Some ten {{thousand}} Cape Afrikaners joined the Boers. In mid-December 1899, during 'Black Week', the British Army suffered reverses at Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso. Chamberlain was critical privately of the British Army's military performance and was often vexed by the attitude of the War Office. When the Boers bombarded Ladysmith with Creusot ninety-four pounder siege guns, Chamberlain asked for the dispatch of comparable artillery to the war, but was exasperated by the Secretary of State for War, Lord Lansdowne's argument that such weapons required platforms that needed a year of preparation, even though the Boers operated their [...] "Long Tom" [...] without elaborate mountings. Chamberlain made a number of speeches to reassure the public, and worked to strengthen bonds between Britain and the self-governing colonies, <b>gratefully</b> <b>receiving</b> over 30,000 troops from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The slogan One Flag, One Queen, One Tongue expressed their loyalty to the Empire, although they each had some Opposition to the Second Boer War. In particular, the contributions of mounted men from these settler colonies helped fill the British Army's shortfall of mounted infantry, vital in fighting the mobile Boers (who were an entirely mounted force of skilled marksmen).|$|R

That she could alleviate this distress more now than ever before proved the adage that it was an ill wind that blew nobody good.

40|$|A {{notation}} system was previously presented which can notate any rational frequency in free Just Intonation. Transposition {{of music is}} carried out by multiplying each {{member of a set}} of frequencies by a single frequency. Transposition of JI notations up by a fixed amount requires multiplication to be defined for any two notations. Transposition down requires inversion to be defined for any notation, which allows division to also be defined for any two notations. Each notation splits into four components which in decreasing size order are octave, diatonic scale note, sharps or flats, rational comma adjustment. Multiplication can be defined {{for each of the four}} notation components. Since rational number multiplication is commutative, this leads to a definition of multiplication for frequencies and thus notations. Examples of notation inversion and multiplication are given. Examples of transposing melodies are given. These are checked for accuracy using the rational numbers which each notation represents. Calculation shortcuts are considered which make notation operations quicker to carry out by hand. A question regarding whether rational commas should be extended from 5 -rough rational numbers to all rational numbers is considered which would greatly simplify notation multiplication. This approach is rejected since it leads to confusion about octave number. The four component {{notation system}} is recommended instead. Extensions to computer notation systems and stave representations are briefly mentioned. Comment: This fourth draft has substantially rewritten the paper to focus on notation transposition only. The prime comma algorithm is now presented in a separate paper, and the previous approach of basing notation on a multiplicative function is dropped in favour of a hybrid notation.

Under the Provident head, certain small annuities are granted to old and hard-working subscribers. Under the Benevolent head, relief is afforded to temporary and proved distress.

Summary — The legacy of apartheid {{had much to do with}} the extraordinary levels of inequality and human insecurity found by the first ever nationally representative living standards survey undertaken in South Africa in 1993. Drawing on a 1998 re-survey of households in the 1993 study, this paper explores whether this legacy has been superseded, or whether apartheid’s end has been only one kind of freedom that has left households in a poverty trap from which they cannot escape. The evidence indicates that significant numbers of South African poor are trapped in chronic, structural poverty, lacking the assets and entitlements needed to successfully escape poverty over time...|$|R
