5000|$|Chiles: peppers of the Capsicum genus. The New Mexico chile {{is a local}} {{cultivar}} of the species, or subspecies of C. annuum. It is visually and genetically {{similar to}} Anaheim peppers, but usually hotter with a different flavor and texture. The large, flavorful New Mexican variety gives the regions cuisine much of its distinctive style, and used so extensively that it is known simply as [...] "chile". <b>Green</b> <b>chiles</b> {{are those that are}} picked unripe; they are fire-roasted, then peeled before further use. Unlike the ultra-mild canned supermarket <b>green</b> <b>chiles,</b> New Mexico <b>green</b> <b>chiles</b> can range from mild to hotter than jalapeños, and come in grades of spiciness at markets that cater to chile aficionados. The climate of New Mexico tends to increase the capsaicin levels in the chile compared to other areas. Red chiles are the ripe form of the same plant (though particular strains are bred for intended use as red or green chile). Generally more piquant than <b>green</b> <b>chiles,</b> they too can be roasted, but are usually dried; they can be added whole, to spice an entire stew, or more often are ground into powder or sometimes flakes. Freshly dried red chiles are sold in string-bound bundles called ristras, which are a common decorative sight on porches and in homes and businesses throughout the Southwest. Chiles may be referred to as chile peppers, especially if the sentence requires them to be distinguished from the chile sauce made from them. The bulk of, and allegedly the best of, New Mexico chiles are grown in and around Hatch, in southern New Mexico. Chimayo in northern New Mexico is also well known for its chile peppers.|$|E

5000|$|Chile or chile sauce: A sauce {{made from}} red or <b>green</b> <b>chiles</b> {{by a variety}} of recipes, and served hot over many (perhaps any) New Mexican dish. Chile does not use vinegar, unlike most salsas, picantes and other hot sauces. Green chile is made with chopped roasted chiles, while red chile is made with chiles dried and ground to a powder. Thickeners like flour, and various spices are often added, {{especially}} garlic and salt. Chile {{is one of the most}} definitive differences between New Mexican and other Mexican and Mexican-American cuisines (which often make a different green chile sauce from tomatillos). Mexican and Californian tend to use various specialized sauces for different dishes, while Tex-Mex leans toward the use of salsa picante and chili con carne (and even Cajun-style Louisiana hot sauce). New Mexican cuisine uses chile sauce as taco sauce, enchilada sauce, burrito sauce, etc. (though any given meal may use both red and green varieties for different dishes). A thicker version of green chile, with larger pieces of the plant, plus onions and other additions, is called green chile stew and is popular in Albuquerque-style New Mexican food; it is used the same way as green chile sauce, as a topping for virtually anything, including American dishes. The term [...] "Christmas" [...] is commonly used in New Mexico when both red and <b>green</b> <b>chiles</b> are used for one dish. The green chile sauce is usually hotter than its red counterpart.|$|E
