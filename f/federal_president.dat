25|$|Casey {{returned}} to Australia in 1946. He was <b>federal</b> <b>president</b> of the fledgling Liberal Party from 1947 to 1950, and re-entered parliament at the 1949 election.

He held various national development portfolios from 1949 to 1951, and then served as Minister for External Affairs {{until his retirement}} from politics in 1960.

25|$|Education Minister Simon Birmingham {{outlined}} the federal governments action {{in response to}} the Louden Review in a media statement. The Turnbull Liberal/National Coalition Government was quick to adopt changes to the program following the review. Some of the actions taken by the Turnbull Government were not recommended in the review. The imposed limits included changes to some materials, limiting access to secondary schools as some material was not easily understood by younger students, and requiring parent opt-ins. <b>Federal</b> <b>President</b> of the Australian Education Union Correna Haythorpe criticised the decision requiring parent body consent before a school could instigate the program saying that decision should be made by educators.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Casey {{returned}} to Australia {{in the hope}} of being elected to parliament in the 1946 election and becoming the leader of the new Liberal Party that Menzies had formed in 1944, as part of his reorganisation of conservative politics in Australia. Casey had turned down the offer of a British peerage to preserve his political chances. However, he was too late to organise his pre-selection for a seat. He was persuaded to become <b>Federal</b> <b>President</b> of the Liberal Party in September 1947 and proved to be a very effective fundraiser, {{partly as a result of}} his past social and business connections. Although Menzies still saw Casey as a rival, and although Casey undoubtedly saw himself as a future Prime Minister, they formed an effective partnership.|$|E
