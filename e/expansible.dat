Se identificaron seis grupos de suelos con características bien definidas. Los Ustipsamentes y Haplustoles de textura gruesa a media se encuentran principalmente en cordones arenosos, vías de drenaje y planicies del sector {{proximal}} del cono; los Argiustoles y Haplustalfes de texturas medias se desarrollan mayormente en las planicies estabilizadas del sector intermedio; mientras que los Haplustertes de textura fina son característicos de los ambientes de bañados del sector intermedio y distal. Los análisis mineralógicos se llevaron a cabo mediante difracción de rayos X (DRX) y medición de la Susceptibilidad Magnética (SM). La DRX del suelo total mostró variaciones en la proporción de cuarzo, feldespatos, muscovita y minerales accesorios entre los perfiles, reflejando la heterogeneidad de sus materiales parentales. La composición mineralógica de la fracción arcilla permitió diferenciar dos tipos de materiales originarios, posiblemente relacionados con distintas áreas de aporte: I) uno rico en esmectitas e illitas donde se desarrollan el Ustipsament, los Haplustoles y el Haplustert; y II) otro con menor proporción de minerales <b>expansibles</b> y dominancia de illita, correspondiente a los horizontes C del Argiustol y el Haplustalf. Por otra parte, las curvas de Susceptibilidad Magnética muestran tendencias opuestas del Vertisol respecto al Argiustol, el Haplustalf y el Haplustol típico, reflejando condiciones físico-químicas diferentes entre estos suelos, mientras que en el Entisol y los Haplustoles énticos, las curvas varían irregularmente de acuerdo con la heterogeneidad de las capas sedimentarias que los conforman. El presente trabajo resume nuevos resultados e interpretaciones acerca de la génesis, composición y distribución de los suelos para una región donde esta información es todavía escasa. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the soil-landscape relationships and the physico-chemical and mineralogical composition of different soils within the alluvial fan of Del Valle river, in the western part of the Chaco region in the Salta Province, Argentina. Six groups of soils with distinct characteristics were identified. Medium to coarse-textured Ustipsamments and Haplustolls were found on elongated gently convex sandy accumulations, drainage networks and plains of the proximal section of the alluvial fan. The medium-textured Argiustolls and Haplustalfs are mainly developed on stabilized plains in the intermediate section, while fine-textured Haplusterts characterize swamp environments between intermediate and distal sections of the fan. Mineralogical analyses were performed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) measurements. The XRD on total soils samples showed variations in the proportion of quartz, feldspars, muscovite and accessory minerals among the profiles, reflecting the heterogeneity of their parent materials. Moreover, according to the mineralogical composition of the clay fraction, two types of parent materials, possibly related to different source areas, were distinguished: I) one containing high proportions of smectite and illite, where Ustipsamments, Haplustolls and Haplusterts are developed; and II) another one with a lower proportion of expansive minerals and dominance of illite, corresponding to the C horizons of Argiustolls and Haplustalfs. The Magnetic Susceptibility of the Vertisol showed an opposite trend to that of the Argiustoll, Haplustalf and Typic Haplustoll, reflecting different physical-chemical conditions between those soil types, while the MS of the Entisol and Entic Haplustolls varied irregularly with depth in accordance to the heterogeneity of their sedimentary layers. This study summarizes new results and interpretations about the origin, composition and distribution of soils in a region where this information is still scarce...|$|R
