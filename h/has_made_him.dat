5|$|McCartney's {{enduring}} fame <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{a popular}} choice to open new venues. In 2009, he played to three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field—a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. These performances yielded the double live album Good Evening New York City later that year.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|In {{a quaint}} rural village, {{an elderly man}} {{receives}} a card in the mail from his youngest grandson, Yogesh (Harman Baweja). In Mumbai, Yogesh's family consults an astrologer to learn if their eldest son, Jitu (Dilip Joshi), a debtor, will go to jail, and also give him Yogesh's birthdate to learn his future. They are astonished to hear that Yogesh will inherit a fortune if he is married on the 20th of that month; the phone rings, and the family is overjoyed to hear that Yogesh's grandfather <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> his sole heir.|$|E
50|$|Jovkić's {{life as an}} {{itinerant}} worker <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a rebel and study <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a socialist. Much of his writing expressed the social protest reflected in this activity, notably Nestor Žučni (Nestor the Embittered), his first book of collected poems.|$|R

Again, if He <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> mortal, God {{would seem to}} be the cause of his death. Neither, then, immortal nor yet mortal did He make him, but, as we have said above, capable of both; so that if he should incline to the things of immortality, keeping the commandment of God, he should receive as reward from Him immortality, and should become God..." ...|$|R
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} ring in Ken's ears like peals of bells. In {{spite of his}} awkwardness Coach Arthurs <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a varsity man; {{in spite of his}} unpreparedness old Crab had given him a passing mark; in spite of his unworthiness President Halstead <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> famous.|$|R
5|$|On the surface, {{the novel}} is a love story between the protagonist Jake Barnes—a man whose war wound <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> impotent—and the {{promiscuous}} divorcée usually identified as Lady Brett Ashley. Barnes is an expatriate American journalist living in Paris, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman with bobbed hair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Robert Cohn causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-old matador Romero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards in Pamplona.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> feel better.|$|E
5|$|Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station's counselor, has {{concerns}} with Nog {{living in a}} fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains {{that he has a}} plan to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E

5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. This is where he was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that what he learned by following his uncle with the Bandits <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> better both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities as a goal scorer.|$|E

25|$|Heseltine’s {{ownership}} of Haymarket <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a large personal fortune. As of 2013 he was ranked 311th in The Sunday Times Rich List {{with an estimated}} wealth, including shareholdings held by members of his immediate family, of £264 million.|$|E
25|$|His {{style of}} {{leadership}} has given him {{the image of a}} seemingly aloof, withdrawn technocrat or intellectual and <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> seem {{out of touch with the}} street, and his seemingly hands-off leadership-by-delegation style made his governments, especially at cabinet level, seem dysfunctional.|$|E
60|$|The {{interview}} with Lady Montfort had been deeply interesting--had {{for a moment}} restored him to himself.

25|$|Davidson {{has been}} known to make {{offensive}} jokes about women, ethnic minorities, gay people and disabled people in his stand-up act, which <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a subject of negative media coverage and frequent criticism.

25|$|My last {{sight of}} Melbourne Cricket Ground was an impromptu little {{gathering}} on the outfield {{in front of}} the banner reading 'M.C.G. Fans Thank Colin – Six Tours.'
