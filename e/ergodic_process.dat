50|$|An <b>ergodic</b> <b>process</b> is {{one which}} {{conforms}} to the ergodic theorem. The theorem allows the time average of a conforming process to equal the ensemble average.

Although the measured process may be stationary in the long term, it is not appropriate to consider the sampled distribution to be the reflection of a single (ergodic) process: The ensemble average is meaningless.

50|$|Statically {{estimation}} is {{to determine}} the expected value(s) of statistical expected values of statistical quantities. Statistical estimation also tries to find the expected values. The expected values are those values that we expect among the random values, derived from samples of population in probability (group of subset). Because we have problem here, and in time series analysis, discrete data obtained as a function of time is usually available rather than samples of population or group of subsets taken simultaneously. The difficulty is commonly avoided by the process which is named <b>ergodic</b> <b>process,</b> that changes with time and probability gets involved with it, and it's not always periodic at all portions of time.|$|E
