Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out.

After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E

25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences {{at the end of the}} pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare.

Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.|$|E

The comic posits a [...] "what-if" [...] scenario wherein Ianto, [...] "who struggles with his feelings for Jack from the offset", sees a face from the future and embarks on a mission that could {{change the course of}} his life (from that of his eventual death in Children of Earth). David Lloyd comments that he [...] "knows [...] character implicitly".s Ianto Jones brought back to life}} In the first part, Ianto (originating from the timeframe of Season Two) is approached by Rhys and Captain John, both post-Children of Earth, who warn Ianto not to believe the offer made by a seductive, time-travelling woman; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> him that their mission is to preserve the timeline in which he dies. In part two, the woman, Mairwyn, informs Ianto of the events of [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] and Children of Earth, and of Jack's departure. Ianto tearfully watches the scene where Jack learns of Gwen's engagement, and sleeps with Mairwyn. After learning of the devastating consequences of assisting Mairwyn, he defeats her and later [...] "retcons" [...] himself. However, in a divergent timeline Ianto appears with Mairwyn, observing his funeral, saying [...] "I can't believe there's a reality where I said no."

2500|$|The {{rules of}} quantum {{mechanics}} are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space (crucially, that the space has an inner product) and that observables of that system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that spaceâ€”although they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately {{in order to obtain}} a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, which states that the predictions {{of quantum mechanics}} reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This [...] "high energy" [...] limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.|$|E
