5|$|For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller {{transferred}} to the VCA Colts, where he won the team's batting trophy for having the best average. At this stage, <b>his</b> <b>method</b> of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, he was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that <b>his</b> <b>method</b> could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on <b>his</b> <b>method</b> for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Invader is a {{graduate}} of the École des Beaux-Arts, a Parisian art school. Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played when he was growing up, particularly characters from Space Invaders, from which he derived his name. Games of the era were made with 8-bit graphics, and so lend themselves well to <b>his</b> <b>method</b> of each tile representing one pixel. Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s and then in 31 other cities in France.|$|E
5|$|James II's statue {{has stood}} in several {{locations}} {{since it was}} first erected. It originally stood in the Palace of Whitehall's Pebble Court, where it was installed on New Year's Day, 1686. It was situated behind the Banqueting House and faced the river, a position which attracted much satirical comment after James' flight from London during the Glorious Revolution of 1688; {{it was said that}} the statue's location indicated <b>his</b> <b>method</b> of escape.|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to.

5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. <b>His</b> <b>method</b> modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved.

Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but <b>his</b> <b>method</b> was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{modern era}} in {{steelmaking}} {{began with the}} introduction of Henry Bessemer's Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. <b>His</b> <b>method</b> let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic Bessemer process) was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained <b>his</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of <b>his</b> <b>method</b> {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows <b>his</b> <b>method</b> of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought <b>his</b> <b>method</b> of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and <b>his</b> <b>method,</b> by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
40|$|The Problem. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{teaching}} methodology of Jesus Christ in the context of His own time. A comparison of His methodology with current adult educational methodology was also made. The result of this study was a list of guiding principles for current adult religious educators. ^ The Procedure. Historical research was the research approach chosen for this study. The actual research was handled in three sections. The first section attempted to analyze the educational methodology from 40 B. C. to 40 A. D. This section answered the question, 2 ̆ 2 What was the standard educational methodology of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 lifetime? 2 ̆ 2 Lists of Greek, Roman, and Jewish methodologies were developed. ^ Section two contained the actual analysis of Jesus Christ 2 ̆ 7 s teaching methodologies. The question, 2 ̆ 2 What were <b>His</b> <b>methods,</b> 2 ̆ 2 was answered. A list of <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> was developed after an analysis of those methods in the specific teaching situations. ^ The last section analyzed current teaching methodologies and compared them to those of Jesus Christ. From this comparison a Methods Selection Chart and a list of ten principles were developed for the current religious educator. ^ Conclusions. As a result of this research the following principles were developed. (1) Jesus selected methods based on the ability of the pupil. (2) Jesus selected <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> based on the attitude on the student. (3) Jesus selected <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> based on the size of the class. (4) Jesus selected <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> based on the location of His teaching. (5) Jesus selected <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> based on the content He was trying to communicate. (6) Jesus selected <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> based on the purposes of His teaching. (7) Jesus used a variety of <b>methods</b> in <b>His</b> teaching, however His variety was purposeful. (8) Jesus never let the method overshadow the purpose or the content of the lesson. (9) Jesus based <b>His</b> <b>methods</b> in the practical, mundane lives of His students. (10) Jesus used <b>methods</b> of <b>His</b> day to their fullest potential. ...|$|R
