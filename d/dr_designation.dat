5000|$|In {{order to}} {{practice}} veterinary {{medicine in the}} UK, a veterinary surgeon must hold a current registration with the RCVS. This requires a qualifying degree, usually in veterinary science or veterinary medicine. From March 2015, veterinary surgeons registered with the RCVS in the UK may optionally use the courtesy title Dr. This makes it the third clinical degree in the UK, after medicine and dentistry, to allow {{the use of the}} title Dr. The origins of veterinary surgeons parallel to human surgery are reflected in human medicine where qualified surgeons also drop their <b>Dr</b> <b>designation</b> and revert to their original title.|$|E

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{staining}} for cluster designation 5 (CD 5) {{has been}} found to label a variety of non-lymphoid tumors. Methods:  A variety of eccrine, apocrine, follicular, epithelial, and pagetoid lesions were selected and stained with an anti-CD 5 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra Labs, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, clone 4 C 7) by immunohistochemistry. The intensity of positive cytoplasmic staining was graded semiquantitatively (1 + weak staining, 2 + strong staining). Additionally, the percentage of positive lesional cells was placed in one of four categories: > 75 %, 25 – 75 %, 1 – 25 %, and < 1 %. Results:  Within normal skin, CD 5 labeled lymphocytes, apocrine glands, deep dermal eccrine glands, and smooth muscle (weak). The majority of benign and malignant apocrine lesions demonstrated strong focal (36 %, n[*]=[*] 11) -to-diffuse (64 %, n[*]=[*] 16) staining. In contrast, labeling of benign eccrine tumors was more focal, tending to localize around ducts (79 %, n[*]=[*] 19). Microcystic adnexal carcinoma demonstrated focal staining of deeper ductal structures (71 %, n[*]=[*] 7), whereas desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and basal cell carcinoma showed only rare positive cells. All cases of mammary (n[*]=[*] 7) and extramammary (n[*]=[*] 8) Paget's disease labeled diffusely for CD 5. Pagetoid Bowen's disease (n[*]=[*] 6), intraepidermal sebaceous carcinoma (n[*]=[*] 3), nor melanoma in situ (n[*]=[*] 6) showed any CD 5 staining. Conclusions:  Immunohistochemical staining for CD 5 is extremely useful in the differential diagnosis of pagetoid epidermal lesions and will mark mammary and extramammary Paget's disease, but not pagetoid Bowen's disease, melanoma in situ, or sebaceous carcinoma.

40|$|Steven B. McMahon, PhD (Moderator) Steven McMahon is Professor of Cancer Biology in the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. He {{also serves}} as Jefferson’s first Associate Provost for Programmatic Research. In his role as Associate Provost, Dr. McMahon {{facilitates}} collaborative research projects among Jefferson faculty, {{as well as between}} our faculty and their regional, national and international colleagues. Dr. McMahon has also held a number of leadership roles within Jefferson’s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, including serving as Deputy Director during the most recent renewal of its National Cancer Institute <b>designation.</b> <b>Dr.</b> McMahon obtained his undergraduate degree from Albright College and his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. He conducted fellowship training at Princeton University and accepted his first faculty position at The Wistar Institute. Dr. McMahon joined Jefferson’s Department of Cancer Biology in 2006. His research program has focused on understanding how the deregulation of transcriptional programs contributes to human cancer. Much of this work has focused on biochemical and molecular genetic analyses of the MYC oncoprotein, the p 53 tumor suppressor and the epigenetic enzymes that they utilize to reprogram the transcriptome of incipient tumor cells. Dr. McMahon’s research has been recognized by awards from the ACS, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, AACR, V Foundation, and the Falk Medical Research Trust. Dr. McMahon has served on the editorial boards of a number of journals in the fields of Cancer and Biochemistry. Similarly he has served on advisory panels making research funding recommendations for the NIH, DOD, ACS and NCI in the US and for the national cancer agencies of Canada, Italy, Belgium, Finland, France, Austria and the United Kingdom. Isidore Rigoutsos, PhD Dr. Rigoutsos is the founding Director of the Computational Medicine Center at Jefferson. He is a Professor in the Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, and has joint appointments in the Department of Cancer Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He {{is also a member of}} Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. Prior to joining Jefferson in 2010, Dr. Rigoutsos spent 18 years at IBM 2 ̆ 7 s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he co-founded the Computational Biology Center in 1992. In parallel with his IBM tenure, Dr. Rigoutsos was a Visiting Faculty at MIT 2 ̆ 7 s Dept. of Chemical Engineering for a decade (2000 - 2010). He is a member of the Editorial Boards of several academic journals that focus on Genomics, Molecular Biology, and Computational Biology. He has authored or co-authored many peer-reviewed journal and conference articles in two fields (Computer Science and Biology/Medicine), and written many book chapters. He is named inventor or co-inventor on 27 US Patents. Since 2002, Dr. Rigoutsos has been studying the molecular biology of short non-coding RNAs with a particular emphasis on microRNAs (miRNAs), miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), transfer RNA (tRNA), and tRNA fragments (tRFs). His research activity focuses on discovering novel regulators and elucidating how they mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Over the years, Dr. Rigoutsos’ laboratory made several key contributions to the field. Central to Dr. Rigoutsos’ work is “transcriptomic heterogeneity” (TH), a concept that he introduced. In TH, disease is associated with differences in the RNA molecules that are produced from a given segment of DNA. This is unlike genomic heterogeneity where disease is associated with variations in the DNA template. Matthias J. Schnell, PhD Matthias Schnell studied Biology in Stuttgart-Hohenheim in Germany and completed his PhD thesis at the Federal Research Center for Virus Diseases of Animals in Tuebingen, Germany.
