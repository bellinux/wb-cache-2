5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a {{difficult}} situation. The opponents of Hugh Despenser {{and his father}} had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further {{half an hour before}} reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of secession, Stone <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> Washington writing his report on Sonora.

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{political}} isolation.

His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E

In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and {{had been on the}} field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E

He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of}} the Civil War.|$|E
