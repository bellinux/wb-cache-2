25|$|Taco Bell {{was founded}} by Glen Bell, who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1946 when he was 23 years old. In 1950, he opened Bell's <b>Hamburgers</b> <b>and</b> Hot Dogs in San Bernardino's West Side barrio. According to Gustavo Arellano, author of Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America, Bell watched long lines of {{customers}} at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which attracted a dedicated customer base for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell began eating there regularly, attempting to reverse-engineer the recipe, and eventually won {{the confidence of the}} proprietors such that they allowed him to see how the tacos and other foods were prepared. In late 1951 or early 1952, he took what he had learned and opened a new stand, this time selling tacos under the name of Taco-Tia.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, <b>hamburgers,</b> <b>and</b> hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E

In a game on February 3 against the Washington Capitals, Chris Kunitz set a career milestone for scoring four goals in one game and was then named NHL Second Star of the Week. With 18.7 {{seconds left in the}} second period in a game on February 13 against the Ottawa Senators, Matt Cooke went to finish a hit on Erik Karlsson when Cooke's skate blade caught Karlsson {{on the back of his}} left leg lacerating his left Achilles. Throughout the first four home games, as part of the special promotion following the lockout, the Penguins organization gave away 52,142 fountain drinks, 33,289 nachos, 26,633 pretzels, 22,258 hot dogs, 22,118 chicken sandwiches and 20,380 <b>hamburgers</b> <b>and</b> sold at half-price 8,680 jerseys, 18,950 T-shirts and 8,776 hats. In a game against the Florida Panthers on February 22, during the third period, Evgeni Malkin was skating toward the Panthers net when he got tangled up with Panthers defenceman Erik Gudbranson and then crashed violently into the boards. Malkin went on to miss the rest of the remaining three games of February and was diagnosed with a concussion suffering from short-term memory loss and retroactively was placed on IR effective the time of initial injury. Sidney Crosby was named NHL Second Star of the Month leading the NHL with 18 assists and 24 points in the 14 games during the month and had six three-point games while obtaining at least one point in eleven of fourteen games. The Penguins lost the last game of February against ex-Penguin Jordan Staal of the Carolina Hurricanes but still finished the month with nine wins and five losses leading the Atlantic Division and second place in the Eastern Conference with twenty-six points.|$|E

500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer is on death row and eats his last meal. The meal {{consists}} solely of junk food like <b>hamburgers</b> <b>and</b> fried chicken. The scene came from an article that the writers had read, in which it said that death sentenced prisoners often requested junk food as their last meal. On {{the way to the}} electric chair, Homer meets a man resembling Michael Clarke Duncan's character John Coffey in The Green Mile. While recording lines for the episode, the staff were told that Duncan was visiting the Fox studios. Having not recorded the lines for the character yet, the staff asked Duncan if he wanted to voice the character, but he declined. The music that plays during the scene is also from The Green Mile. The idea that Homer's execution was in fact a reality show on Fox was conceived by former staff writer George Meyer. According to fellow writer Matt Selman, the writing staff liked the idea since reality shows were [...] "really big" [...] at the time. The episode features American actress Frances Sternhagen as Mrs Bellamy, and glamour model Carmen Electra as herself. According to Jean, Electra's character is [...] "one of the most voluptuous figures" [...] they have ever had on The Simpsons.|$|E
