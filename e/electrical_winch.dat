5000|$|The Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle turns over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal. An <b>electrical</b> <b>winch</b> with a capacity of 5000 kg can be mounted {{at the front of}} the vehicle if required, and the windshield can be removed. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and two passenger seats to his right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. A full length skid pan protects the hull and allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Mitsubishi A-727 fully automatic with a torque converter, there are 3F and 1R gears - the Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle is in 4 x 4 drive all the time.

40|$|A {{leading cause}} of serious weight-training {{injuries}} and death among bodybuilders and weight-lifters is training with heavy barbells without {{the assistance of a}} human 'spotter ' or gym partner. A spotter can identify lack of progress or nearness of muscle failure and provide additional force to assist with the lift, so that the lift can progress slowly prior to complete muscle failure, allowing the maximum benefit to be gained from the exercise. This paper briefly describes the modeling, design and performance of a computer-controlled mechatronic system that automates the 'spotting ' process for horizontal barbell exercises, which includes exercises such as squats, bench press, overhead shoulder press, barbell triceps extensions and bicep curls. The system employs a unique pulley system attached to a strong structural frame, a solenoid-activated locking brake, optical position sensors and a low-cost embedded microcontroller system that drives a display screen, control panel, a geared <b>electrical</b> <b>winch</b> (motor) and cables attached to a standard barbell. Known as the ‘Smart Gym’, the basic system design, its different modes of operation and important safety features are described. This system also has the potential to save the lives of many people each year by preventing barbell suffocation (asphyxiation due to neck compression) and fatal injuries caused by heavy, free-falling barbells. Several fitness equipment manufacturers have already shown interest in using concepts described in this paper for implementation in current and future gym equipment.

40|$|Soundings {{were carried}} out on daily basis by using Vaisala tethersonde system DigiCORA TT 12 with maximum {{altitude}} of 2000 m. The instrumentation consisted of 7 m 3 helium filled balloon for lifting sondes, an <b>electrical</b> <b>winch,</b> three sondes suspended on the tether line below the balloon at approximately 20 m vertical intervals, and a ground station. Limited by the wind speed, however, soundings were not possible to perform every day. Each profile in dataset includes ascending and descending profiles of variables. Dataset presents raw data where no averaging over the sondes and heights is done. Yet, data is checked manually for errors. Some distinct obviously erroneous signals and spike values {{were removed from the}} data. More about the methods is described in ReadMe text file. The melt of snow and sea ice in Svalbard and its fjords is strongly controlled by the radiative and turbulent surface fluxes. The fluxes depend, among others, on the structure of and processes in the ABL. Over a complex topography, such as Svalbard mountains and fjords, the state of the ABL is not well known. It is affected by the synoptic-scale flow conditions, which vary between cases of advection of warm, marine air masses from open ocean and cold-air outbreaks from the north or east. Data of vertical profiles of atmospheric variables were collected {{as a part of the}} project "Atmospheric boundary layer and its interaction with snow and sea ice in Svalbard fjords". The principal objective of the project was to better understand and quantify the processes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over complex topography in Svalbard and their interaction with the snow and sea ice surface. Soundings archive consists 17 high-resolution vertical profiles of the measured atmospheric characteristics (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and air pressure) acquired from the tethersonde soundings campaign in Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard archipelago) between 21 March and 2 April in 2009.

40|$|A tethersonde {{system by}} Vaisala (DigiCORA TT 12) {{was applied to}} measure {{high-resolution}} vertical profiles of atmospheric variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and air pressure) up to 2000 meters. The instrumentation consisted of 7 m 3 helium filled balloon for lifting sondes, an <b>electrical</b> <b>winch,</b> two sondes suspended on the tether line below the balloon at approximately 10 m vertical intervals, and a ground station. Sondes were ascended as high as possible at every measurement. Depending on the cloud conditions, wind speed, and the buoyancy of the balloon, {{the height of the}} soundings varied, but was in average 1212 m. Each profile includes ascending and descending of the sonde. Sampling interval of the sondes was in average 5 - 6 seconds. Length of the soundings was variable depending of the weather conditions. Tethersonde system is wind sensitive and there were some temporal gaps in planned measurements when soundings could not be performed due to the strong winds and heavy snowfall. Since 17 th of October soundings were done in collaboration with University Centre in Svalbard. Measurements then were simultaneously carried out in Adventdalen fjord. These synchronized atmosphere soundings were aimed to study ABL at different places in a same time. Data is checked manually for errors but no averaging over the sondes and heights is done. Some distinct obviously erroneous signals and spike values were removed from the data. More about the methods is described in ReadMe text file. Arctic fjords are usually surrounded by a complex orography of mountains, valleys and glaciers, which complicates the dynamics of the air flow. Between different fjords in Svalbard temperature and wind regime can vary largely in space. Due to the combined effects of the complex orography and thermal heterogeneity of the fjord surface, the dynamic and thermodynamic processes affecting the state of the ABL are complex. Although several studies have addressed boundary-layer and mesoscale processes in the Svalbard region, there is still lack of thorough observational analysis on temperature and humidity inversions and low-level jets, based on an extensive dataset. The major challenges still remain in understanding several features in the stable boundary layer (SBL). The fieldwork campaign in Hornsund (Svalbard archipelago) was part of the project focusing on a vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and its possible changes in the Polar regions. Our study is motivated to better understand the ABL structure over fjords. There is need to improve numerical weather prediction and climate models and to improve the forecasting capabilities on near-surface weather. Gathering more in situ data would allow us to rise quality of analyses of ABL characteristics and aim better on these goals. Dataset consist 52 vertical profiles from tethersonde soundings. These soundings were carried out on a regular basis in Polish Polar Station in Hornsund between 7 October and 1 November 2014.
