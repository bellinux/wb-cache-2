Policy makers who need to pay attention to different aspects of poverty - incidence, intensity and severity - find in this study useful elements to both draw a detailed picture of the degree of poverty relative to student learning, and detect the grades of the educational system where outcomes are more critical. The analysis is accomplished by adopting both one-dimensional and multidimensional approaches to deprivation. In the latter case, this paper presents empirical results of a range of poverty measures by using some indicators of the class of multidimensional indexes proposed by Alkire and Foster (2011) and Bourguignon and Chakravarty (2003), applied {{for the first time in}} the analysis of cognitive skills.

40|$|Doctor EducationisThis study {{examined}} the three education poverty alleviation policies in relation to learners’ capabilities and was grounded in the Capability Approach as a conceptual framework pioneered by the economist and philosopher, Amartya Sen. The study posits {{the view that the}} policies investigated and evaluated are essential in terms of contributing to the well-being of learners, particularly those living in poverty, as well as offering opportunities for every child, irrespective of social and/or economic background. The theoretical framework which conceptualise the dimensions of poverty, re-imagines the South African case. A local investigation was undertaken to understand the poverty dynamics in the Quintile 1 schools in the Frances Baard District of the Northern Cape Province. The empirical research was done using a mixed methodology within the pragmatic paradigm. The investigations were based on and informed by the policies and the components of the Capability Approach. An investigation into the extent and processes of the implementation of these policies, and their impact on poverty alleviation in the schools, was considered necessary in order to provide information on the successes and limitations encountered in the implementation processes.

40|$|Since the Obama {{administration}} {{launched the}} Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, which offers temporary relief from deportation {{and the right}} to apply for work authorization for certain unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children, 55 percent of the 1. 2 million youth who immediately met the program's criteria have applied, according to MPI estimates. As the first two-year eligibility period draws to a close, early DACA beneficiaries have begun to apply for renewal, with nearly 25, 000 renewal applications submitted as of July 20, 2014. This report provides the most up-to-date estimates available for the size, countries of origin, educational attainment, employment, English proficiency, age, gender, and poverty rates for the DACA population nationally and for key states, based on an analysis of U. S. Census data. The report also offers DACA application rates nationally and in key states, as well as for particular national-origin groups. The MPI researchers find that slightly more than 2. 1 million unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children are potentially eligible for DACA [...] with 1. 2 million having immediately met the age, education, length of residence, and other criteria when the initiative launched in 2012. Two other groups could prospectively gain DACA status: 426, 000 youth who appeared to fulfill all but the education requirements as of the program's launch, and 473, 000 who were too young to apply but become eligible once they reach age 15 if they stay in school or obtain a high school degree or equivalent. The analysis provides a mixed picture of DACA's first two years. On the one hand, the sheer volume of applicants is impressive. On the other, hundreds of thousands of immigrant youth have not yet gained a status that can change their lives in measurable ways, allowing them improved job prospects, the ability to apply for driver's licenses, and more.

40|$|Concerning {{education}} we find contradictory developments. We observed {{an enormous}} educational expansion {{as well as}} we witness the emergence of <b>educational</b> <b>poverty</b> and social exclusion of people effected. Considering this background the aim is, to develop a concept that allows answering the research question, whether in the long run we can observe social progress or regress in the field of education. To give an answer a concept of social progress in education has to be developed first. Building upon theories of justice, equality of opportunity and progress I will work out 8 dimensions of social progress in education spanning from equity and capabilities to participation and recognition. The operationalisation of these dimensions consists of 26 indicators which all are calculated empirically and show the actual status and development over time. Besides that results for disadvantaged groups are calculated because the concept developed builds upon the hypothesis, that social progress can be observed, when social differences decrease. Many indicators cover besides Austria several European countries. The findings not only tell a story of educational success. Only a limited number of indicators show social progress others even social regress. For instance the odd ratio for belonging to the low achievers groups not only equals a five-time risk for pupils with a poor socioeconomic background but also grew over time. Even indicators showing social progress reveal a long way to go, since social disadvantages still are enormous. Dimensions focused on the educational system in many cases show progressive developments whereas the dimensions covering consequences of education in society point in a regressive direction. In international comparison developments work out differently for different countries. Besides booming countries starting from a low level of social progress also continuous improving countries starting from a high level can be found. On the other hand side countries are situated showing a decreasing trend either from a high or even from a low level of development. All together progressive and regressive elements are in balance and therefore do not allow a final judgement. But growing exclusion of migrants and low qualified people demand policy measures ensuring that also the most vulnerable find their place in the societal elevator and will not be left behind...|$|E

Results using mixed-effects models show that the increase in educational attainment between cohorts is associated with reductions in conviction rates for most offences (burglary, theft, criminal damage and drug related offences) but not for violent crime. Reductions in poverty are associated with decreasing conviction rates for violent crime, criminal damage and drug related offences whereas increasing unauthorised time away from school is associated with higher convictions rates for theft.

40|$|The {{process of}} development, in any society, should ideally be viewed and {{assessed}} {{in terms of}} what it does for an average individual.
