Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, however, {{where he}} is. All I {{know is what}} I have communicated to you--the {{contents}} of this letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm all right," [...] she replied. [...] "And you've come to--your wound's healed; but you've been sick. Fever, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> all <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I callated," [...] he cried, {{still holding}} Wetherell's {{hand in a}} mild, but persuasive grip. [...] "So <b>I</b> callated. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> you an injustice, Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lemuel {{knew that}} his hour had come, if ever it were to come, and he said hoarsely: [...] "I <b>guess</b> if <b>I</b> made you take cold that day, it wasn't all <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> worse than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> then," [...] said a sulky man, who was {{preparing}} to wheel away Marian's trunk. [...] "He's about to shift his billet to the Gran' Central." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson {{looked at}} him curiously. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I'd mix myself a good strong pick-me-up if I were you. You have had {{something}} on your mind the last day or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[Mollified--with a smile.] Well, I wouldn't blame you, at that. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> look rotten--yust {{out of the}} {{hospital}} two weeks. I'm going to have another 'ski. What d'you say? Have something on me? ...|$|E
6000|$|Grant smiled, {{more with}} his lips than his eyes. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> taught you to shoot {{as well as}} most men, Hetty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wouldn't {{go in the}} parlour, {{but come}} right out here in her fine clothes. I told her I didn't think she belonged in a kitchen--but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> her an injustice," [...] said Euphrasia, slowly.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true." [...] Mrs. Lander brightened and warmed again. [...] "I guess it's all right. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> right, and <b>I</b> {{got to be}} satisfied. I presume I {{could get}} the consul to make me a will any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be going to do now?" [...] Tom said. [...] "Some fresh piece of homage, I should <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish they would leave us alone. It is {{annoying}} enough {{to be treated as}} a god, without being disturbed by these constant worshippings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know him? jest <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> His name is Jim Haskett, {{and he used}} to be {{the mate}} of the Sunflower, a three-master from Penobscot. I sailed under him once, and he was the hardest man on {{shipboard}} I ever got next to. If he gets in the navy, he'll make everybody under him dance to his pipings, and worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I--er--I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that night," [...] {{answered}} Will Jackson in some confusion. [...] "Anyway, I'm a great potato eater," [...] {{he added}} lightly. Later on the others {{found out that}} Spud had a vivid imagination and {{did not hesitate to}} [...] "draw the long bow" [...] for the sake of telling a good story.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{the major}} motif," [...] he hurriedly explained, [...] "the big underrunning motif, the cosmic and {{universal}} thing. I {{tried to make it}} keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all. I was on the right scent, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it badly. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I'll learn in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What if I did?" [...] the man replied gruffly. [...] "I can't help {{where the}} bush rangers pay their visits. Yes, {{they came in}} here and said they wanted some supper; and you may <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not keep them waiting long, for they were not in a {{particularly}} good temper. From what they said, three of their men had been killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> like it! {{and cried}} {{because no one}} was ever so good to me before, and I couldn't help it. As for patronising, you may walk on me if you want to, and I won't mind," [...] said Phebe, {{in a burst of}} gratitude, for the words, [...] "we are sisters" [...] went {{straight}} to her lonely heart and nestled there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Nome, [...] "I {{knew all the}} Oz people, and you can <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love them. All during my wanderings I have brooded on how I can be revenged on them. Now that I've met you I can see a way to conquer the Land of Oz and be King there myself, which is better than being King of the Nomes." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[Deeply {{moved and}} troubled--forcing a {{trembling}} laugh.] So {{you told him}} that, Mat? No wonder he was mad. [Forcing out the words.] Well, maybe it's true, Mat. Maybe I do. I been thinking and thinking--I didn't want to, Mat, I'll own up to that--I tried to cut it out--but--[She laughs helplessly.] I guess I can't help it anyhow. So I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Mat. [Then with a sudden joyous defiance.] Sure I do! What's the use of kidding myself different? Sure I love you, Mat! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} <b>guessing</b> what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> {{if my mother}} had been {{anything}} but what she was, as from <b>guessing</b> what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> if <b>I</b> had a talent for music.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did. He {{slapped me}} in the face. That angered me so greatly that I pitched into him without {{thinking}} twice. It was all done in a few seconds. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'd <b>do</b> it again," [...] added Jack. [...] "I wouldn't let anybody slap me without getting back at him. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that I'd make a mighty poor soldier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,"--he {{took it from}} her--"the biggest {{that has}} been thrown into the arena for quite a while. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> with it for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must be that}} I do, though I {{never had}} such a thought. Wheat is so wonderful. No one can guess who does not know it!... The clean, plump grain, the sowing on fallow ground, the long wait, the first tender green, and the change day by day to the deep waving fields of gold--then the harvest, hot, noisy, smoky, full of dust and chaff, and the great combine-harvesters with thirty-four horses. Oh! I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love it all.... I worked in a Spokane flour-mill, too, just to learn how flour is made. There {{is nothing in the}} world so white, so clean, so pure as flour made from the wheat of these hills!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, dog-gone it, Miss Mason, you're right--in a way. I've built {{hundreds}} of houses up there, and I remember I was proud and {{glad to see}} them go up. I'm proud now, when I remember them. And there was Ophir--the most God-forsaken moose-pasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on. I made that into the big Ophir. Why, I ran the water in there from the Rinkabilly, eighty miles away. They all said I couldn't, but I did it, and I did it by myself. The dam and the flume cost me four million. But {{you should have seen}} that Ophir--power plants, electric lights, and {{hundreds of}} men on the pay-roll, working night and day. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing. I made Ophir, and by God, she was a sure hummer--I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to cuss. But that Ophir!--I sure am proud of her now, just as the last time I laid eyes on her." ...|$|E
5000|$|None of {{the teens}} showed any remorse or {{apologized for the}} murder. Paul Sweeney, the victim's father, {{addressed}} Domenic Coia, saying, [...] "Look at me, Domenic, with your evil eyes". Domenic Coia responded, [...] "I never thought I had evil eyes, but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> And I'm cool." [...] The judge, in denying defense counsel's motion for a sentence that could allow for parole, said: [...] "There is a level of inhumanity that exists in these facts. This was a totally depraved act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guess I do!" [...] was the snorted-out reply. [...] "They {{came around}} to my place yesterday, and stole my apples and pears, and talked sassy to my darter an' the hired man. I saw 'em, but they ran, away before I could git my hands on 'em. I vowed I take 'em down a peg when I met 'em, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> it," [...] added the old farmer, with evident satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|The King. He'll take no harm of it. I'll follow presently..... He's all his mother's now {{and none}} of mine-- Her very face on the bride-pillow. Yet I tricked her. But that was later--and she never <b>guessed.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think he sinned much--he's too young-- Much {{the same age as}} my Queen. God must not judge him Too hardly for such slips as youth may fall in. But I'll entreat that Throne.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} what I was thinking. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> sha'n't <b>do</b> it, though. <b>I</b> sh'd neva have the courage." [...] Clementina laughed and then fell rather seriously silent again.|$|R
5000|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Well, {{throughout}} my career I {{have turned to}} mythological figures, who went away from conformity and the collected {{to make up their}} own mind about stuff, to put it {{in a bit of a}} mundane way. It's more of a scenario and also very much an escape from conformity and the collected. Nietzsche has been a huge influence on me, in particular during the years that I've been doing my solo stuff. He was a hermit, he wrote about hermits and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this in a kind of hermit-like way myself. I am here in my hermit’s cave, a studio, doing my stuff alone. On different levels it just reflects aspects of the album itself and probably aspects of how I see things and how I work." ...|$|E
5000|$|Henderson {{adopted an}} exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter Jim Murray {{described}} Henderson's strike zone as being [...] "smaller than Hitler's heart". In 1982, {{he described his}} approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't {{have much of a}} strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, [...] "Stand up and hit like a man." [...] I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that to people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dark wig [...] . blue chin [...] . heavy eyebrows [...] . <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>do</b> {{better than}} my old Chicago Ed. make-up. Say, Jimmy, how am I {{to get to the}} kid?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Duchess. Thankee, miss. You see, thar's no one {{the boy has}} {{any claim}} on but me, and I ain't the proper person to bring him up. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> allow {{to send him to}} 'Frisco, last year; but when I heerd talk that a schoolma'am was comin' up, and you did, and he sorter tuk to ye natril from the first, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well to keep him yer. For, oh, miss, he loves ye so much; and, if you could hear him talk in his purty way, ye wouldn't refuse him anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it. But <b>I</b> haven't tramped {{that far}} for sixteen years. Most {{of the sports}} go by boat. But <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it if you say so--I guess." [...] Joe walked away in sadness.|$|R
