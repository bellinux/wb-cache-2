40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic utility of real-time elastography (RTE) in differentiating between reactive and metastatic cervical lymph nodes (LN) in patients with primary head and neck cancer in comparison with the conventional B mode and power Doppler parameters. Methods: A total of 127 lymph nodes in 78  patients with primary head and neck cancer were examined by B-mode sonography, power Doppler ultrasound and elastography. Elastographic patterns were determined on the distribution and percentage of the lymph node area with low elasticity (hard), with pattern 1 being an absent or very small <b>hard</b> <b>area</b> to pattern 5, a <b>hard</b> <b>area</b> occupying the entire lymph node. Patterns 3 – 5 were considered metastatic. Ultrasound guided aspiration cytology was done for 57 lymph nodes. Excision biopsy was done for 52 lymph nodes. Eighteen lymph nodes responded to conservative treatment, and were considered reactive. Results: The majority (85. 3 %) of the metastatic lymph nodes had elastography pattern 3 – 5. This finding was observed in only 5 % of the benign lymph nodes (P <  0. 001). The elastography pattern had sensitivity of 85. 3 %, specificity of 95. 5 %, PPV of 97. 2 %, NPV of 78. 1 % and overall accuracy of 88. 9 % in differentiation between benign and malignant lymph nodes. On the other hand, for the B mode criteria, the best accuracy was given to abnormal hilum (83 %). The accuracy of power Doppler ultrasound pattern was 70. 8 %. Conclusions: The accuracy of sonoelastography is higher than usual B mode and power Doppler ultrasound parameters in differentiation between benign and malignant nodes. The integration of lymph node sonoelastography in the follow up of patients with known head and neck cancer may reduce the number of biopsies...|$|E

40|$|We have {{modified}} and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) {{that allow}} the detection of cantilever bending as well as torsional vibrationsat ultrasonic frequencies. Oscillatingeither probe tip of sample vertically modulates the normal force about the setpoint force, acting between tip and sample. When the tip contacts the sample, the surface resists the oscillation and deformation of the sample is dependent of the local stiffness or elasticity. For a constant normal force, a soft area deforms more than a <b>hard</b> <b>area</b> and thus the cantilever deflection is less over a soft area. The variations in cantilever vertical oscillation {{is a measure of}} relative elasticity of the sample. Elasticity maps with a lateral resolution of better than 100 nm have been taken on alumina-based ceramic composite, and on two metal particle (MP) recording tapes. By vibrating the sample laterally, the shear forces are modulated. Detecting and analyzing the cantilever torsional behavior, we are able to characterize friction and viscosity of thin films used for lubrication of magnetic disks...|$|E

40|$|Finite element (FE) {{models of}} the vocal tracts {{corresponding}} to the vowels /i / and /u / joint with a FE model of the nasal tract are analyzed. Acoustic modal and transient analyses of the FE models are performed in frequency and time domains. The frequency response functions and time responses are calculated in the nodes near the lips and nostrils. Both FE models involve the effect of cleft palate. The numerical results are compared with acoustic measurements. 1. Finite element {{models of the}} vocal tract The FE models were created from MRI images using a direct transformation of MRI data into FE models. The FE model relevant to the nasal cavities {{was added to the}} models of vocal tract manually according to the anatomical literature. Both models involve effect of clefting of the soft palate for various the cleft sizes. Material properties: speed of sound c 0 = 353 m/s, air density ρ 0 = 1. 2 kg/m 3. Boundary conditions: zero acoustic pressure at the lips and nostrils, boundary areas of acoustic spaces acoustically hard and the absorption was modelled by the coefficient β = r/ρ 0 c. Figure 3 : Excitation pulses according to Titze et al [1]. A connection of the nasal and oral cavities was considered in the back area of the soft palate modelling the velofaryngeal insufficiency. Excitation pulses corresponding to the acoustic velocity of the airflow throw the glottis were used for the transient analysis of the FE models in time domain. 2.

40|$|A novel {{analysis}} method {{based on the}} theory described by Hertz {{was used to determine}} physical properties at micrometer scales in filled EPDM elastomers, having different degrees of crystallinity. The method relies on the proportionality between the contact area of the indentation and the stiffness. While the second (stiffness) can be calculated using an exponential fit to the unloading part of a force-distance curve, the contact area determination is a parameter difficult to estimate. In the past, a model for describing the tip shape, and consequently the contact area of the tip, which is mandatory for the E-modulus calculation, was used. In any AFM experimental set-up the tip shape of a cantilever is likely to suffer changes in its shape. Therefore any theoretical model of the shape of the cantilever tip becomes inaccurate for the calculation. In the present work the tip shape has been experimentally quantified in real time, therefore reducing the uncertainties that aroused from the tip shape. E-modulus values determined by AFM and DMA show a high degree of correlation. Nevertheless extrapolating the calculated values at zero force, similar moduli – deviating by only about 10 % – are obtained for both methods. In terms of micromechanical behavior AFM proved to be an adequate tool being able to distinguish between 3 phases from a polymer mixture: high stiffness (filler particle) very low stiffness (polymer) and intermediate stiffness (crystallite) caused by different cooling rates. The heterogeneous build up is higher in the slow cooled material, which leads to inhomogeneities in the material. The fast cooled shows a higher homogeneity. Nevertheless a correlation between the AFM and the NMR has been shown while investigating barrier materials obtained by a sol-gel process. The NMR-MOUSE measured the overall relaxation of the material as a function of depth. Using this technique, a gradient of relaxation times was observed in the material. Complementary to this method, AFM was able to investigate the micromechanical properties of the sample, differentiating between <b>hard</b> <b>area</b> near the surface and in the centre of the material. Overall these experiments show the capability of AFM of surveying local mechanical properties and studying heterogeneous samples. Such spatially resolved measurements cannot be achieved with any other technique...|$|E
