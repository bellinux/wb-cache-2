25|$|Although the Al-Hijr {{site was}} proclaimed as an archaeological {{treasure}} {{in the early}} 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. The prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has only resulted in minimal low-key archaeological activities. These conservative measures have started to <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations, {{as part of the}} government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Spending {{the winter}} in Gaul, Metellus Pius {{returned}} to Spain in 74 BC. He captured the towns of Bilbilis and Segobriga, before joining Pompey at the siege of Calagurris. They were forced to raise the siege when Sertorius approached, after which Pius returned to Gaul. Continued successes during 73 BC saw him <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> and allow Pompey to take {{the burden of the}} final phases of the war, with Sertorius’ murder in 72 BC. He imposed new taxes in Hispania Ulterior after the end of Sertorius’ rebellion. Pius’ governorship ended in 71 BC {{with the end of the}} war. He disbanded his army after crossing the Alps, and celebrated a triumph together with Pompey on December 30, 71 BC. Regardless of the triumph, during those eight years of resistance he was unable to conclusively defeat Sertorius, and it was only after Sertorius' assassination by his own men that the rebels were forced to cede to the military ability of Metellus Pius.|$|E

25|$|Taylor did {{not finish}} {{top of the}} Premier League {{for the first time}} this year. He won eight, drew four and lost four of his 16 matches to finish third in the table. He played Van Barneveld in the semi-finals who he had beaten 7–3 and drawn with 6–6 during the league stage. From 3–3, Taylor surged ahead to triumph 8–4 and book his spot in the final against Van Gerwen. Taylor started the better of the two as he led 5–3 at the break. However, he then lost four {{successive}} legs upon the resumption of play. In the 14th leg, Van Gerwen opted not to go for the bull when on 87 and Taylor stepped in to hit a 160 finish to level the match at 7–7. At 9–8 down, Taylor had left 40 after 12 darts. Nonetheless, Van Gerwen hit a 132 finish on the bull to seal a 10–8 win and the title. After the match, Taylor vowed to <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> on his schedule but increase his practice in order to play his best at the major events.|$|E
500|$|In The New York Times, {{conservative}} columnist William Safire {{wrote that}} Miami's gay activists had been justifiably defeated: [...] "In {{the eyes of}} the vast majority, homosexuality is an abnormality, a mental illness, even—to use an old-fashioned word—a sin. Homosexuality is not the 'alternative lifestyle' the gay activists profess; it may be tolerable, even acceptable—but not approvable." [...] Safire, however, tempered the column (titled [...] "Now <b>Ease</b> <b>Up,</b> Anita") cautioning against Bryant's promised nationwide crusade designed to lead to further repeal of homosexuals' [...] "legitimate civil rights".|$|E
500|$|Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ.ie {{wrote that}} [...] "Love Somebody" [...] {{alongside}} [...] "Daylight", [...] "The Man Who Never Lied" [...] and [...] "Lucky Strike" [...] are potential single releases. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse called the song [...] "earnest", while Cameron Adams of Herald Sun {{described it as}} Coldplay [...] "trying to be" [...] Katy Perry. Similarly as Adams, PopMatters' Evan Sawdey wrote that [...] "Love Somebody" [...] is the group's [...] "sky-scraping Coldplay moment". Jeremy Thomas of 411 Mania labeled the song {{as one of the}} more emotional tracks on Overexposed and a [...] "rare moment where the overhanging production tricks <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> just enough to make for an honest-to-God song with emotion and not just a laser scope aimed at the Billboard charts.|$|E

500|$|Once {{it enters}} Spring Valley (where {{it is known}} locally first as South Main Street, then as North Main Street after it crosses its very busy {{intersection}} with NY59), NY45 continues northward through the downtown business district. Traffic here tends to pile up many times a day. After NY45's intersection at Hillcrest with CR74 (the location of several small shopping centers), traffic tends to <b>ease</b> <b>up.</b> North of there, NY45 provides {{a link to the}} Hassidic Jewish community of New Square, although it never enters the village limits. At CR80, NY45 enters New Hempstead. Again the road becomes relatively quiet, but it begins to parallel the Palisades Interstate Parkway, until its intersection at exit12 in Pomona. NY45 quickly leaves Pomona and enters Mount Ivy. This is where NY45 comes to its northern terminus at US202. This area of US202 is in downtown Mount Ivy, and exit13 of the Palisades is just [...] west of NY45's northern terminus.|$|E
500|$|Taraki {{signed a}} Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union on 5 December 1978 which greatly {{expanded}} Soviet aid to his regime. Following the Herat uprising, Taraki contacted Alexei Kosygin, {{chairman of the}} USSR Council of Ministers, and asked for [...] "practical and technical assistance with men and armament". Kosygin was unfavorable to the proposal {{on the basis of}} the negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country, and he rejected all further attempts by Taraki to solicit Soviet military aid in Afghanistan. Following Kosygin's rejection Taraki requested aid from Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet head of state, who warned him that full Soviet intervention [...] "would only play into the hands of our enemies – both yours and ours". Brezhnev also advised Taraki to <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{featuring}} the alien rebels incinerating {{a group of}} Russian alien abductees was filmed without actual Russian cars. Picture car coordination Nigel Habgood noted, [...] "I couldn't get real Russian cars, so I decided to get creative and go seriously European. We burned a couple Saabs, and a BMW 2002. I'm sorry we couldn't get any Yugos." [...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder than it looks to create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> the shots. The tagline for this episode is [...] "Resist or Serve". The tagline was later used for The X-Files game, [...] {{as well as the}} official book covering the fifth season of the show. The list of victims viewed by Scully in her hospital room was made up of X-Files staffers.|$|E

50|$|The 1959 {{national}} championship used the car racing circuit at Monthléry. Anglade {{was in a}} leading group with five laps left. Louison Bobet was leading the chase. The commissaires had {{got as far as}} clearing following cars out of the way so that the chasers could regain the leaders. Anglade dropped {{to the back of his}} group, had something to eat, and set off alone when Bobet and the others were nearly on them. The others hesitated and the chasers <b>eased</b> <b>up</b> when the two groups came together. Anglade was convinced he'd won and <b>eased</b> <b>up</b> with 100m left to raise his hands in victory.|$|R
500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E

2500|$|... "Hegelianism {{promised to}} make {{absolute}} knowledge available {{by virtue of}} a science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical progression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel's logic would {{have access to the}} mind of God (which for Hegel was equivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard thought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of Babel, or a scala paradisi — a dialectical ladder by which humans can climb with <b>ease</b> <b>up</b> to heaven. Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader."
