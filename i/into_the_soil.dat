5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> to regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E
5|$|The bulb lies dormant {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has {{contractile}} roots that pull it down further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.|$|E
30|$|The {{detection}} of organophosphorus pesticides in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> samples suggests that cocoa {{farmers in the}} study area use organophosphate pesticides in significant quantities. These pesticides may have found their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> via spray drift during cocoa tree spraying, wash-off from treated cocoa trees and wrong disposal of left over spray solution, sprayer wash water and used pesticide containers.|$|R
40|$|When {{incubated}} with acid, alkaline, {{and neutral}} soils, {{a variety of}} synthetic sulfate esters representing the various classes of these compounds was hydrolyzed by enzymes, probably of microbial origin. The appearance of sulfate in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> water occurred immediately after introduction <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> with some esters, whereas with others it occurred only after lag periods. Heat treatment destroyed the hydrolytic acitivity in <b>the</b> <b>soils.</b> <b>The</b> ester sulfate groups present in humic acid extracted from <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> appeared to be resistant to hydrolysis {{by a variety of}} sulfohydrolases extracted from bacteria and other organisms...|$|R
50|$|Lichens may be {{important}} in contributing nitrogen to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting <b>the</b> nitrogen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils.</b> Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes. In deserts and semi-arid areas, lichens are part of extensive, living biological soil crusts, essential for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> structure. Lichens have a long fossil record in soils dating back 2.2 billion years.|$|R
5|$|A saprobe or parasite, O.nidiformis is nonspecific in its {{needs and}} is {{compatible}} {{with a wide variety}} of hosts. It has been recorded on native Banksia (including B.attenuata and B.menziesii), Hakea, Acacia, Nuytsia floribunda and various Myrtaceae, including Agonis flexuosa and Melaleuca species, and especially Eucalyptus, as well as Nothofagus, Casuarina species and Allocasuarina fraseriana, and even introduced trees such as Pinus or Platanus species. It plays an important role in breaking down wood and recycling nutrients <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5|$|However {{just before}} the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate {{announced}} that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> by rain or other natural processes, it mixes with the soil to create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E

On top of the rhizome, is the vestiges or remains of last seasons leaves, the maroon-brown fibres interweave, creating a spiral like effect. They also surround the base of the new leaves, as a sheath.|$|R
5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all species}} in the genus Lactarius, L.subflammeus is mycorrhizal, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with trees. The fungus and the plant forms structures called ectomycorrhizae, a specialized sheath of hyphae {{on the surface of}} the root from which hyphae extend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and into the outer cortical cells of the root. The fruit bodies of L.subflammeus grow scattered to grouped under conifers or in mixed conifer-hardwood forests near pine and spruce, from August to December. The fungus is widely distributed in the Pacific Northwest, where it is very common in conifer forests. The habitat of the type location was coastal sand dunes under pine. States from which the fungus has been collected include Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Colorado. The mushroom's range extends north into Canada, where it has been found near Victoria, British Columbia in coastal forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).|$|E

5|$|Suillus americanus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, a mutualistic relationship {{where the}} fungus forms a sheath {{on the surface}} of the root from which hyphae extend outward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis, while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil).</b> In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of the wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, {{and they}} were {{responsible}} for plowing the fields and trampling seed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> The slaughter of a fattened ox was also {{a central part of}} an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land. Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
