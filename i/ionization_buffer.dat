(1) and Nelson and Cohen (2) {{found that}} {{erythrocyte}} lithium con-centration and erythrocyte/plasma lithium ratio {{may be of}} greater diag-nostic significance than is serum lithium concentration. Lyttkens et al.

Our own clinical results are in harmony with this inter-pretation. Hisayasa et al. (4) proposed that atomic absorption spectrophotometry without internal standards be used for such analyses. Unfortunately, their use of a relatively hot (2600 K) air/acetylene flame and the lack of an <b>ionization</b> <b>buffer</b> and internal standards decrease the general usefulness of their proce-dure. In performing our routine erythrocyte lithium analyses we find that atomic absorption spectrophotometry is not necessary.

By exploring different Carbon doping profiles in the epi layers, the substrate buffer leakage is substantially reduced, which in turns results in lower dynamic Ron.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Statherin is a {{salivary protein}} that {{inhibits}} the nucleation {{and growth of}} hydroxyapatite crystals in the supersaturated environment of the oral cavity. The thermodynamics of adsorption of statherin onto hydroxyapatite crystals have been characterized here by isothermal titration calorimetry and equilibrium adsorption isotherm analysis. At 25 °C, statherin adsorption is characterized by an exothermic enthalpy of 3 kcal/mol that diminishes to zero at 25 % surface coverage. The initial heat of statherin adsorption increases with temperature, displaying a positive heat capacity change of 194 (7 cal K- 1 mol- 1 at 25 °C. The heat of adsorption during this initial phase {{is strongly dependent on}} the buffer species, and from the differential heats of <b>buffer</b> <b>ionization,</b> it can be calculated that approximately one proton is taken up by the crystal or protein upon adsorption. The free energy of adsorption is dominated at all coverages by a large positive entropy (g 23 cal K- 1 mol- 1), which may be partially due to the loss of organized water that hydrates the protein and the mineral surface prior to adsorption. These results are interpreted using a two-site model for adsorption of statherin onto the hydroxyapatite crystals. Organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for controlling inorganic mineral growth to make high-perfor-mance composite materials such as bone and teeth, and t...|$|R
40|$|The use of aqueous alkali for the {{titration}} of esterolytic activity {{when the}} esters are dissolved in alcoholic solutions, {{results in an}} error due {{to changes in the}} <b>ionization</b> of the <b>buffer.</b> This is corrected by titrating with alkali in the same solvent as the substrate. Alcohols and other substances which change the dielectric strength of water modify the rate of hydrolysis of BAEE 1 and TSAME by trypsin to an extent proportionate to their effect on the dielectric strength. The reaction rate increases with diminished dielectric strength and v/ce rersa. At low concentrations of substance {{there seems to be no}} specific effect other than that derived of the variation in dielectric strength. At higher concentrations, the enzyme might be denatured. In addition, it is probable that specific effects of each substance might intervene. The Coulombic and thermic energies of activation were calculated for the two esters in various solvents. The plot of the logarithm of rate constant rs. reciprocal of dielectric constant yields a straight line with positive slope. This behavior is similar to that of a non-enzymatic positive ion-dipole reaction. Trypsin reacts like a positive ion. The possible influence of the dielectric strength on the regulation of the equilibria involved in the interconversion of the various forms of trypsin in solution (active, inactive, denatured) is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with synthesis of carbon-based as well as metal-oxide thin films using highly ionized plasmas. The principal deposition method employed was high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). The investigations on plasma chemistry, plasma energetics, plasma-film interactions and its correlation to film growth and resulting film properties were made. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts: (i) HiPIMS-based deposition of carbon-based thin films and (ii) HiPIMS-based deposition of metal-oxide thin films. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, HiPIMS based strategies are presented that were developed to address the fundamental issues of low degree of carbon ionization and low deposition rates of carbon film growth in magnetron sputtering. In the first study, a new strategy was introduced for increasing the degree of ionization of sputtered carbon via increasing the electron temperature in the discharge by using a higher <b>ionization</b> potential <b>buffer</b> gas (Ne) in place of commonly used Ar. A direct consequence of enhanced electron temperatures was observed in the form of measured large fluxes of ionized carbon at the substrate position. Consequently, high mass densities of the resulting amorphous carbon (a-C) thin films reaching 2. 8 g/cm 3 were obtained. In another study, feasibility of HiPIMS-based high density discharges for high-rate synthesis of dense and hard a-C thin films was explored. A strategy was compiled and implemented that entailed coupling a hydrocarbon precursor gas (C 2 H 2) with high density discharges generated by the superposition of HiPIMS and direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS). Appropriate control of discharge density (by tuning HiPIMS/DCMS power ratio), gas phase composition and energy of the ionized depositing species lead to a route capable of providing ten-fold increase in the deposition rate of a-C film growth compared to that obtained using HiPIMS Ar discharge in the first study. The increased deposition rate was achieved without significant incorporation of H ( 25 GPa) and mass density (~ 2. 32 g/cm 3). The knowledge gained in this work was utilized in a subsequent work where the feasibility of adding high <b>ionization</b> potential <b>buffer</b> gas (Ne) to increase the electron temperature in an Ar/C 2 H 2 HiPIMS discharge was explored. It was found that the increased electron temperature lead to enhanced dissociation of hydrocarbon precursor and an increased H incorporation into the growing film. The resulting a-C thin films exhibited high hardness (~ 25 GPa), mass densities in the order of 2. 2 g/cm 3 and H content as low as about 11 %. The striking feature of the resulting films was low stress levels where the films exhibited compressive stresses in the order of 100 MPa. In the second part of the thesis, investigations on reactive HiPIMS discharge characteristics were made for technologically relevant metal-oxide systems. In the first study, the discharge characteristics of Ti-O and Al-O were investigated by studying the discharge current characteristics and measuring the ion flux composition. Both, Ti-O and Al-O discharges were dominated by large fluxes of ionized metallic as well as sputtering and reactive gases species. The generation of large ionized fluxes influenced the discharge characteristics consequently surpassing the changes in the secondary electron emission yields which, in the case of DCMS discharges entail contrasting behavior of the discharge voltage for the two material systems. The study also suggested that the source of oxygen ions in the case of reactive HiPIMS is both, the target surface (via sputtering) as well as gas phase. In a subsequent study, the knowledge gained from the studies on metal-oxide HiPIMS discharges was utilized for investigating the behavior of reactive HiPIMS discharges related to ternary compound thin film growth. In this work Al-Si-O system, which is a promising candidate for anti-reflective and solar thermal applications, was employed to carry out the investigations under varied target compositions (Al, Al 0. 5 Si 0. 5, and Al 0. 1 Si 0. 9). It was found that the discharge current behavior of metal and oxide modes of Al-Si-O HiPIMS discharges were similar to those of Al-O and were independent of the target composition. The influence of energy and composition of the ionized depositing fluxes on the film growth was also investigated. It was shown that stoichiometric Al-Si-O thin films exhibiting a refractive index below 1. 6 (which is desired for anti-reflective applications) can be grown. Furthermore, the refractive index and chemical composition of the resulting films were found to be unchanged with respect to the energy of the depositing species. The effect of ionized deposition fluxes that are generated in metal-oxide HiPIMS discharges was also investigated for the phase composition and optical properties of TiO 2 thin films. It was found that energetic and ionized sputtered flux in reactive HiPIMS can be used to tailor the phase formation of the TiO 2 films with high peak powers facilitating the rutile phase while the anatase phase can be obtained using low peak powers. It was also demonstrated that using HiPIMS, these phases can be obtained at room temperature without external substrate heating or  post-deposition annealing. The results on plasma and film properties were also compared with DCMS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe αβ T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) {{is responsible for}} recognizing peptides bound and “presented” by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. We recently reported that at 25 °C the A 6 TCR, which recognizes the Tax peptide presented by the class I MHC human leukocyte antigen-A* 0201 (HLA-A 2), binds with a weak ΔH°, a favorable ΔS°, and a moderately negative ΔCp. These observations were of interest given the unfavorable binding entropies and large heat capacity changes measured for many other TCR-ligand interactions, suggested to result from TCR conformational changes occurring upon binding. Here, we further investigated the A 6 -Tax/HLA-A 2 interaction using titration calorimetry. We found that binding results in a pKa shift, complicating interpretation of measured binding thermodynamics. To better characterize the interaction, we measured binding {{as a function of}} pH, temperature, and <b>buffer</b> <b>ionization</b> enthalpy. A global analysis of the resulting data allowed determination of both the intrinsic binding thermodynamics separated from the influence of protonation as well as the thermodynamics associated with the pKa shift. Our results indicate that intrinsically, A 6 binds Tax/HLA-A 2 with a very weak ΔH°, an even more favorable ΔS° than previously thought, and a relatively large negative ΔCp. Comparison of these energetics with the makeup of the protein-protein interface suggests that conformational adjustments are required for binding, but these {{are more likely to be}} structural shifts, rather than disorder-to-order transitions. The thermodynamics of the pKa shift suggest protonation may be linked to an additional process such as ion binding...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the viability of using plasmas formed by ionization of high Z, low ionization potential element rubidium (Rb) for beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The Rb vapor column confined by argon (Ar) buffer gas was used to reduce the expected limitation on the beam propagation length due to head erosion that was observed previously when a lower Z but higher ionization potential lithium vapor was used. However, injection of electrons into the wakefield due to <b>ionization</b> of Ar <b>buffer</b> gas and nonuniform ionization of Rb 1 + to Rb 2 + was a possible concern. In this paper we describe experimental results and the supporting simulations which indicate that such ionization of Ar and Rb 1 + {{in the presence of}} combined fields of the beam and the wakefield inside the wake does indeed occur. Some of this charge accumulates in the accelerating region of the wake leading to the reduction of the electric field—an effect known as beam loading. The beam-loading effect is quantified by determining the average transformer ratio ⟨R⟩ which is the maximum energy gained divided by the maximum energy lost by the electrons in the bunch used to produce the wake. ⟨R⟩ is shown to depend on the propagation length and the quantity of the accumulated charge, indicating that the distributed injection of secondary Rb electrons is the main cause of beam loading in this experiment. The average transformer ratio is reduced from 1. 5 to less than 1 as the excess charge from secondary ionization increased from 100 to 700  pC. The simulations show that while the decelerating field remains constant, the accelerating field is reduced from its unloaded value of 82 to 46 [*][*]GeV/m due to this distributed injection of dark current into the wake...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} of the electroneutral {{exchange of}} competing sodium and potassium with protons across the membrane of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were determined at two pH values when transport was {{induced by the}} simultaneous presence of (222) C 10 -cryptand and FCCP (proton carrier) at various temperatures. The aim of the present work was to quantify the pH-dependent enthalpies of an ionizable mobile carrier affinities for competing alkali cations, and {{to focus on the}} effects of pH and temperature on the competitive transport selectivity of the carrier for K+ over Na+ ions. At any given temperature and pH, the apparent pH-dependent affinity of (222) C 10 was higher for K+ than for Na+. The enthalpy of this affinity for K+ was significantly lower than that for Na+ whereas it varied similarly with the pH (ΔH(KmKpH) = 32. 8 and 37. 0 kJ/mol, and ΔH(KmNapH_ = 47. 9 and 52. 9 kJ/mol at pH 7. 8 and 8. 8, respectively). When using a kinetic model, the pH effect on these parameters was discriminated (ΔH(KmK) = 37. 9 kJ/mol and ΔH(KmNa) = 53. 9. kJ/mol). The pH-dependence of the ΔH(KmpH) of the actions could therefore theoretically be shown to arise from the temperature-induced changes in the <b>ionization</b> of the <b>buffer</b> dissolved in the aqueous phases and of the amine groups of the binding cavity of the carrier. The K/Na competitive transport selectivity (Sc(K/Na)) of (222) C 10 increased linearly with the K+ concentration. It decreased hyperbolically with increasing concentration of Na+ while being independent of pH at any given temperature. In equimolecular ionic mixtures, Sc(K/Na) varied from 2. 2 to 3. 0 when temperature rose from 20 °C to 35 °C (ΔH(Sc(K/Na)) = 15. 6 ± 0. 5 kJ/mol). The results are discussed in terms of the structural, physico-chemical and electrical characteristics of carriers and complexes...|$|R
