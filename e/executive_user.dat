To realize IDM, the traditional geomechanical infrastructural use case was defined and the process specific workflow (activities & data exchange) was determined by developing an infrastructural process map. In order to ensure correct data exchange between the involved processes various Exchange Requirements (ER) were specified. But to the effect an infrastructural product model like IFC is still not available, the data exchange {{as well as the}} ER specification was made by different formats.

40|$|Executives {{have long}} been {{regarded}} as the last {{group of people in}} an organization to use computers. There are several reasons for this: their work highly unstructured and non-repetitive; they rely on verbal communication more than any other type of communication; they already have support staff for their information needs; and it is difficult for system analysts to 2 ̆ 2 make them talk 2 ̆ 2 about their information requirements. Moreover, they are busy people who might not have time to acquire the skills needed to use computers. However, a new type of information system, known as Executive Information System (EIS), emerged in the 1980 s aimed at <b>executive</b> <b>users</b> and this has achieved some success. This research is an exploratory analysis of EIS implementations in the conditions of a Less Developed Country (LDC), namely Turkey. Although Turkish organizations are fairly computerized compared to many other LDCs, the concept of EIS is in its infancy in the country and there are very few EIS implementations. Four pioneering organizations were identified and extensive interviews were conducted with both the <b>executive</b> <b>users</b> and the support staff. The scarcity of EIS applications in the country required such a qualitative case study approach. By any measure EIS is a newly emerging type of IS (Information System) in the country, and only general observations rather than specific recommendations could be provided about its development, implementation and usage. This is true for not only Turkey, but almost all other developing countries. Like most types of IS, almost all research in this emerging field comes from western countries (mainly US) where conditions are very different from developing countries. The reasons for such differences in conditions are manifold: The maturity level of IT (Information Technologies) and the sociocultural environment are the most important ones. It is obvious that the cultural environment has very important implications for organizational and managerial practices {{as well as for the}} implementation of information technologies in a country. Hence, researchers in developing countries have the immediate task of establishing robust research practices to foster information technologies in the context of their own cultural settings...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of developing computer-based systems to support the understanding of information by <b>executive</b> level <b>users.</b> The approach taken {{is based on the}} use of prior knowledge in the form of knowledge (cognitive) structures to understand new information. The knowledge structures used are case, schemata, concepts, and semantic networks. A system architecture for supporting information understanding, the Understanding Support System (USS), was developed and was implemented on an Apple Mac using HyperCard software. The USS is implemented in an object-oriented architecture using hypertext organization methods to support the cognitive process of associative information development and retrieval. Node and link representation and associative schemes are used to store and represent cognitive structures in the form of networks of interlinked nodes of knowledge. These networks are treated as individual units by the USS. The current system supports a single user for: (1) building mental representations, (2) using prior knowledge in the form of knowledge nodes, knowledge structures, and case knowledge, (3) using knowledge structures for knowledge base access, and (4) navigation of the knowledge base through links that associate knowledge nodes in the cognitive structures. Eventually the USS can support use of a corporate knowledge base by many users. An evaluation of the USS based on human-computer research methodologies for systems development is discussed...|$|R

In keeping with its JCG(T&E) {{approved}} TECNET Project Management Plan (PMP), the TECNET Steering Committee adopted the following TECNET Vision Statement in 1991 : "To systematically migrate existing TECNET resources to a standards compliant, multi-level secure communications and processing capability which links DoD test and evaluation entities to a shared, but controlled user community information resource". TECNET GENERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: The life blood of ongoing TECNET operations is the continual improvements and user support provided by a leading University. This Research and Development contract directly contributes to the continued well being of TECNET. This contract sustains TECNET as {{a state of the}} art communication tool for its users who are continually increasing their capabilities. They expect their T&E network to keep pace. This is particularly true as more <b>executive</b> <b>users</b> adopt TECNET. PLANNED MULTI-LEVEL SECURE (MLS) EXPERIMENTS: Near term MLS experiments are designed to lay a foundation for longer term objectives. The foremost characteristic of the second generation TECNET is that host computers and all associated user nodes be eventually capable of processing information ranging in classification from UNCLASSIFIED through SECRET, depending upon the nature of the information requirements of the user. Specific components of the TECNET MLS plan include secure network devices and MLS accredited hardware running MLS accredited software. These characteristics will permit TECNET to operate in the requisite secure mode per COMSEC directives, support T&E program officials and T&E practitioners with timely and meaningful value added information concerning T&E, and permit near real time exchange of T&E data. MLS experiments are tri-service in nature. DATA DISTRIBUTION RESEARCH: The TECNET Distributed Data Plan calls for tri-service participation in building a T&E common data dictionary in 1992. The RCC agreement to form a common Range data Dictionary Group sets the stage for such a cooperative effort. One necessary and highly desired product of this process is a detailed catalog of all known and emerging T&E related data bases. TECNET plans to field and populate such a catalog of T&E data bases during 1992. Further, using the generic data extraction and conversion tool offered to TECNET, the demonstration of third party data base data population from the ranges will be accomplished. A significant effort has been undertaken to perform the necessary analysis to establish this tool to work with the RCC defined common data elements and the target data bases. Finally, TECNET proposes to develop specific training materials in print and computer based training media, as well as on site training support, for selected data bases of widespread value to the T&E community...|$|R

40|$|With the {{inception}} of the Legal Services Act 2007 following the Clementi Report on new ways of providing legal services in the UK, the Bar is moving to alter the way it practices. Traditionally, the Bar has been a referral profession relying on solicitors and other professionals to instruct barristers when legal opinions or advocacy is sought. In recent years the Bar has attempted to open the barristers' profession to more direct access from clients thus bypassing solicitors. This has had a mixed reaction among barristers and barristers' clerks. Some see it as the route to a modern diverse profession while others see it as potentially harming these traditional relationships between barrister and solicitor that have been built up over many years. Among solicitors this has been met by their own moves to become advocates in the higher courts. The report presents findings from research carried out among barristers, clerks, chambers chief <b>executives,</b> and <b>users.</b> Data were collected via interview, survey, and documentary sources. It shows that barristers represent value for money for clients because of lower overheads than solicitors. But the current rules in place that regulate how barristers carry out direct access work do more to hinder than encourage users. The report concludes that since the Legal Services Act will permit "alternative business structures" which will directly compete with barristers, and solicitors, an expansion of direct access work is one way of countering the effects of these changes...|$|R
