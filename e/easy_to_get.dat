5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the crest, but {{it was difficult to}} stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E

25|$|With a 455kHz IF it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{adequate}} {{front end}} selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600kHz, the local oscillator {{will be set}} to 600 + 455 = 1055kHz. But a station on 1510kHz could also potentially produce an IF of 455kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600kHz and 1510kHz are so far apart, {{it is easy to}} design the front end tuning to reject the 1510kHz frequency.|$|E

It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact.

25|$|According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas {{has one of}} {{the highest}} divorce rates. The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans {{themselves}} getting divorced. Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> Las Vegas {{has one of the}} highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see Las Vegas weddings).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{particularly}} high, these mountains are rugged {{and should not}} be underestimated. Severe weather conditions in the North Shore Mountains often contrast dramatically with mild conditions in nearby Vancouver. This is especially true in winter, but even in summer, large precipices are hidden very close to popular hiking trails and it is very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost, despite being in sight of the city. Those who venture into the North Shore Mountains for whatever reason should be well prepared at any time of year.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to end the shame and secrecy of infertility, Redbook in October 2011 {{launched}} a video campaign, The Truth About Trying, to start an open conversation about infertility, which strikes one in eight women in the United States. In a survey of couples having difficulty conceiving, conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck, 61 percent of respondents hid their infertility from family and friends. Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant, and there's no shame in that.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in November 1940, John Ashworth Ratcliffe {{was moved}} from the Air Ministry side of Bawdsey to start an AA gunnery school at Petersham {{on the west side}} of London. One problem that became {{immediately}} evident was that the inputs to the predictors, the analog computers that handled ballistics calculations, were very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> wrong. This information was fed back through the Army hierarchy, and again it was Bedford who produced the solution. This resulted in the building of several Trainers that were used at the AA school, allowing operators to hone their skills.|$|E
25|$|The park {{received}} an estimated 15 million visitors each year, and daily visits exceed 250,000. Sunday {{is the most}} popular day to visit because the museums are free, and visitors may spend the entire day in one or more sections viewing the attractions, picnicking, or grilling. Despite its local popularity, however, foreign visitors usually only see the small fraction of the park near the museums. The park is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to via public transportation. Metro Lines 1 and 7 have stations at park entrances to the east and south respectively. Several bus lines along Paseo de la Reforma.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} an important point appears: all the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the Coriolis force is the only factor is the parabolic turntable. A somewhat more complex situation is the idealized example of flight routes over long distances, where the centrifugal force of the path and aeronautical lift are countered by gravitational attraction.|$|E

25|$|The Miramichi River valley, {{received}} a significant Irish immigration {{in the years}} before the potato famine. These settlers tended to be better off and better educated than the later arrivals, who came out of desperation. Though coming after the Scottish and the French Acadians, they made their way in this new land, intermarrying with the Catholic Highland Scots, and to a lesser extent, with the Acadians. Some, like Martin Cranney, held elective office and became the natural leaders of their augmented Irish community after the arrival of the famine immigrants. The early Irish came to the Miramichi because it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to with lumber ships stopping in Ireland before returning to Chatham and Newcastle, and because it provided economic opportunities, especially in the lumber industry. They were commonly Irish speakers, and in the eighteen thirties and eighteen forties there were many Irish-speaking communities along the New Brunswick and Maine frontier.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Norway increased from 150,000 in 1500 to 900,000 in 1800. By 1500 most deserted farms were repossessed. The period under absolutism increased {{the ratio of}} self-owning farmers from twenty to fifty percent, largely through sales of crown land to finance the lost wars. Crofts became common in the absolutism period, especially in Eastern Norway and Trøndelag, with the smallholder living {{at the mercy of}} the farmer. There were 48,000 smallholders in 1800. Compared to Denmark, taxes were very low in Norway, typically at four to ten percent of the harvest, although the number of farms per legd decreased from four to two in the 1670s. Confirmation was introduced in 1736; as it required people to read, elementary education was introduced. The Norwegian economy improved with the introduction of the water-driven saw in the early 16th century. Norway had huge resources of timber but did not have the means to exploit much of it in the Middle Ages as only hand-tools were available. The new saw mills which sprang up in the fjords changed this. In 1544 a deal was struck with the Netherlands (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and the Dutch controlled the export of Norwegian timber for the next 150 years. Amsterdam was built on piles from Norway. Tree-felling was done in the winter when farm-work was impossible and it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the felled trees across the snow to the rivers. In the spring, the logs floated down the rivers to the saw mills by the sea. By the mid-16th century the power of the Hanseatic League in Bergen was broken; though German craftsmen remained, they had to accept Danish rule. Many Norwegians earned a living as sailors in foreign ships, especially Dutch ones. The crews in both sides of the Anglo-Dutch Wars contained Norwegians. Norway benefitted from the many European wars of the 18th century. As a neutral power it was able to expand its share of the shipping market. It also supplied timber to foreign navies.|$|E
