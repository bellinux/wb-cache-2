40|$|ABSTRACT. Fogger {{application}} of pesticide in greenhouses can reduce application time and applicator contact with equipment. Since fog applications use {{smaller and more}} concentrated droplets than typical wet spray applications, potential for inhalation and off-target transport hazards may be increased. This study investigated temporal characteristics of airborne pesticide after thermal fogging of a greenhouse. Droplet size spectra and concentration of airborne pesticide were measured. Volume median diameter of the suspended aerosol decreased from 14 to 2. 3 µm during 1. 5 h after application. Concentration of airborne pesticide decreased by 60 % in the first hour after application and by 95 % during 12 h after application. Implications for respiratory exposure were analytically developed from observed data. <b>Hand</b> <b>spraying</b> with high-pressure, high-volume systems {{is the most common}} technique of pesticide application in greenhouse culture. However, fog or aerosol applications are feasible and often-used alternatives for enclosed structures. The motivations for fog application are the potential to increase spray deposition; improve pest control efficacy; and reduce application times, rates of active ingredients, and applicator exposure. A common fogging procedure in greenhouse operations is to apply the fog in late afternoon or early evening. This practice allow...|$|E

Farmers were interviewed using questionnaires and 708 cattle examined. The mean farm size was 3. 2 hectares and {{average number of}} cattle per farm 20, with 66 % of the farms having 3 - 16 animals. This indicated that dairy-cattle farming is a smallholder concern in the district. The cattle were crossbreeds mainly of Hostein-Friesian and Ayrshire kept {{as a source of}} milk for domestic consumption and sale. High proportions of the farmers considered diseases (75 %), high cost of drugs (70 %), high cost of supplementary feeds (70 %) and inadequate pastures (60 %) as the main production constraints. East Coast Fever (ECF) was ranked as the most important disease. The majority (62 %) of farmers used acaricides, which were applied at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks on 75 % of the farms mostly through <b>hand</b> <b>spraying.</b> Forty percent of cattle were infested with ticks, indicating that tick borne diseases (TBDs) are a risk to cattle production.

40|$|We review recent {{research}} into the impact of bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata (DC.) Norl.) on coastal ecosystems which suggest this weed is having widespread impacts on ecosystem services, flora and fauna. Increased decomposition rates and altered nutrient cycling accompany changes in plant community structure and composition. Changes in invaded habitats influence invertebrate and bird assemblages. We summarize research that shows that the establishment phase of seedlings is the key phase where bitou bush out competes native species through both resource and interference competition mechanisms. Control of bitou bush at sites by <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> and/or hand pulling, and aerial spraying alone do not restore all species that were in uninvaded coastal communities, although these management techniques can reduce seed availability of bitou bush. We suggest that destruction of bitou bush seedlings should be specifically targeted in weed management strategies and that long term management plans are developed to ensure control of secondary weeds that {{are at risk of}} invading after bitou bush control. These activities should include using fire to encourage native seed germination and to potentially remove volatile allelopathic chemicals in the soil. Management strategies should also include replanting schemes to increase species richness of all plant structural groups to build ecosystem resilience. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Three {{issues are}} pointed out clearly in this paper. The first issue {{refers to the}} method and {{strategy}} and its related problems of reusing organic material for farmland {{as it is shown}} by Biomass Nippon. While the second issue based on a random survey points out the limits of organic material for reuse as manure in farmland, the third one emphasizes its potential as organic liquid fertilizer in paddy fields, based on a project on circular use of organic material run in Oki Town, Fukuoka Prefecture. The Biomass Nippon project regards the reuse as manure as the main method to apply organic material in farmland. However, the primer problem occurring for the agricultural sector in practice is related to labor for dispersing the manure. Because manure, on the one hand, has already been dispersed as a possible reuse of organic material and labor been used it is believed to be difficult to additionally expand the reuse of manure. However, on the other <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> liquid organic fertilizer by using the irrigation system is regarded as being less labor intensive when comparing with the dispersion of manure in paddy field farming. Therefore, the application of organic liquid fertilizer is considered one appropriate method and strategy for reusing organic material in farmland...|$|E
40|$|In annual crops, where {{disturbance}} intensities {{are generally}} high, numerous investigations demonstrated beneficial effects of organic and other extensive farming practices on biodiversity. It is however unclear if organic farming {{has the same}} beneficial effect in perennial crops (e. g. vineyards) because of a generally reduced background disturbance level. Moreover, the impact of farming practices on biodiversity may differ between trophic levels. We tested the effect of farming practices differing in disturbance intensity on the abundance, species richness and community composition of three trophic levels (plants, grasshoppers and spiders) in Swiss vineyards. Organic and conventional vineyards were compared, and within the latter different options of weed control (mowing vs. mulching) and pest management (<b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> vs. helicopter spraying) were investigated. In contrast to findings in annual crops, organic farming promoted neither diversity nor abundance at any trophic level. Grasshopper diversity was even significantly lower in organic compared to conventional vineyards. Weed control as well as pest management differed in their effects, depending on the trophic level. Within conventionally managed vineyards, spider and grasshopper diversity were enhanced by mulching, while plants benefited from the lower disturbance of mowing. The greater disturbance of fungicide spraying by hand than by helicopter was disadvantageous for grasshoppers, but did not affect spiders and plants. Thus, different taxa respond differently not only {{to an increase in}} disturbance but also to different types of disturbance and local site conditions. We conclude that disturbance in organically farmed vineyards appears to be too low to be beneficial for biodiversity...|$|E

However, <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> offers on advantage over hand removal of ticks in terms of saving labour. The main advantage of strategic spraying lies in more thorough removal of ticks and possibly prevention of dermatophilosis at a lower cost than year-round use of acaricide.

40|$|A {{participatory}} epidemiological (PE) {{study was}} conducted with livestock keepers in Moroto and Kotidodistricts, Karamoja Region, Uganda, between October and December 2013 to determine the management options and relative importance of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) amongst transhumant zebu cattle. Data collection involved 24 focus group discussions (each comprising 8 – 12 people) in 24 settlement areas (manyattas), key informant interviews (30), direct observation, a review of surveillance data, clinical examination, and laboratory confirmation of cases of TBDs. Methods used in group discussions includedsemi-structured interviews, simple ranking, pairwise ranking, matrix scoring, proportional piling andparticipatory mapping. The results of pairwise comparison showed the Ngakarimojong-named diseases, lokit (East Coast fever, ECF), lopid (anaplasmosis), loukoi (contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, CBPP), lokou (heartwater) and lokulam (babesiosis), were considered the most important cattle diseases in Moroto in that order, while ECF, anaplasmosis, trypanosomosis (ediit), CBPP and nonspecific diarrhoea (loleo) were most important in Kotido. Strong agreement between informant groups (Kendall’s coeffi-cient of concordance W = 0. 568 and 0. 682; p < 0. 001) in pairwise ranking indicated that the diseases werea common problem in selected districts. East Coast fever had the highest median score for incidence (18 %[range: 2, 33]) in Moroto, followed by anaplasmosis (17. 5 % [8, 32]) and CBPP (9 % [1, 21]). Most animalsthat suffered from ECF, anaplasmosis, heartwater and babesiosis died, as the respective median scoresfor case fatality rates (CFR) were 89. 5 % (42, 100), 82. 8 % (63, 100), 66. 7 % (20, 100) and 85. 7 % (0, 100). In Kotido, diseases with high incidence scores were ECF (21 % [6, 32]), anaplasmosis (17 % [10, 33]) andtrypanosomosis (8 % [2, 18]). The CFRs for ECF and anaplasmosis were 81. 7 % (44, 100) and 70. 7 % (48, 100),respectively. Matrix scoring revealed that disease indicators showed strong agreement (W = 0. 382 – 0. 659,p < 0. 05 –p < 0. 001) between informant groups. Inadequate knowledge, poor veterinary services and lim-ited availability of drugs were the main constraints that hindered the control of TBDs. Hand picking ofticks was done by all pastoralists while <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> with acaricides was irregular, often determined byavailability of drug supplies and money.

40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the operations of}} the Extended Malaria Control Program which utilizes residual DDT spraying of homes as a method of malaria control. The Extended Program, initiated by the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas, is now being administered by its successor, the Communicable Disease Center of the U. S. Public Health Service. DDT insecticide used as a residual spray in houses is a new weapon of attack against an old enemy [...] MALARIA. When solutions or emulsions of DDT are sprayed on walls and ceilings, an almost invisible residual deposit of DDT crystals is left on the surface. Malaria mosquitoes and other insects which come in contact with these crystals are poisoned. They die later if they have received a sufficient exposure. This method of killing insects is especially valuable in malaria control activities because mosquitoes inside houses are the ones which are most likely to bite malaria sufferers and thus become infected. These infected mosquitoes have ample opportunity to rest on treated surfaces in houses sprayed with DDT and be killed before they can spread the disease to uninfected persons. This is the basic principle of malaria control through residual spraying. DDT residual spraying is a new insecticidal technique. Before it could be put to extensive use in malaria control programs, it has been necessary to develop new formulas, make changes in spraying equipment, and devise new methods of spraying. This handbook supplies detailed information about formulas used for concentrates and spray mixtures, latest spraying methods, care and use of equipment, and safe practices in handling DDT in U. S. P. H. S. malaria control operations. Suggestions for dealing with the public are also given. The handbook is intended for use by project supervisors and as an aid in training spraying crews.

40|$|Tick borne {{diseases}} (TBDs) {{are responsible}} for huge economic losses in cattle production in most African countries {{where the majority of}} cattle owners are the resource poor communal farmers. Governments have initiated and co-ordinate tick control programs with farmers required to contribute funds for their sustenance. The success of these programs will hinge upon the involvement of communal farmers in their design, implementation and evaluation. To this end, 313 communal farmers (approximately 8. 4 % response rate) were interviewed and 3 focus group discussions were carried out in the southern low-veld part of Zimbabwe with the objectives of investigating communal farmers' perceptions on TBDs affecting cattle, level of participation in government initiated tick control programs, other tick control methods practiced, types of acaricides used and their perceived effectiveness. There was a general awareness of TBDs with 67. 7 % (n= 212) farmers being able to describe tick diseases with names or clinical and post-mortem signs. The diseases or problems frequently associated with ticks were cowdriosis (38 %, n= 119), mastitis (36. 7 %, n= 115), anaplasmosis (36. 1 %, n= 113), body damage (28. 4 %, n= 89), babesiosis (24. 6 %, n= 77) and poor body condition (16. 6 %, n= 52). Cattle mortalities due to TBDs were reported by 23. 8 % (n= 74) of the farmers. The plunge dip was consistently used by farmers (70. 3 %, n= 220) to control ticks. Other tick control methods practiced were the <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> (67. 4 %, n= 211), hand dressing (16. 6 %, n= 52), traditional methods (5. 4 %, n= 17), use of pour-ons (4. 5 %, n= 14) and smearing (2. 2 %, n= 7). The formamidines were the most common class of acaricide used (59. 4 %, n= 186), followed by synthetic pyrethroids (29. 1 %, n= 91), macro cyclic lactones (12. 8 %, n= 40) and organophosphates (4. 5 %, n= 14). Most farmers (75. 2 %, n= 231) perceived these acaricides to be effective in controlling ticks. The results of focus group discussions showed that a number of factors influenced the success of government initiated tick control programs and these included inconsistent supply of acaricides, unaffordable dipping fees, lack of water, long distance to the dip tank, lack of information on dipping procedures and lack of knowledge on strategies for delaying acaricide resistance. This study demonstrates that while farmers can be a valuable source of information with regards to the epidemiology of tick borne diseases affecting their cattle, there is still need for further training in understanding the TBDs and strategies for their control...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand the occurrence, diversity and epidemiology of tickborne diseases (TBDs) in a transhumant pastoral area of Karamoja Region, Uganda. We used participatory epidemiology (PE), involving focus group discussions (n = 24) with livestock keepers, 30 key informant interviews, review of previous surveillance data, clinical examinations, and laboratory confirmation of cases of TBDs, to define and prioritise cattle diseases, evaluate current control activities, and identify constraints to the control of TBDs. The livestock keepers regarded TBDs, particularly East Coast fever (ECF) and anaplasmosis, as the most important health problems in their cattle, based on morbidity and mortality rates, rates of transmission, treatment costs, difficulty in accessing the correct treatment, difficulty to control, and inadequate knowledge to manage the diseases. The main constraints to the control of TBDs were inadequate knowledge, inadequate veterinary services and limited availability of drugs. Hand picking of ticks was done by all pastoralists while <b>hand</b> <b>spraying</b> was done with under-strength acaricides, often at irregular intervals and with little acaricide wash. We determined the endemic status of TBDs in 20 randomly-selected cattle herds by estimating the proportion of annual ECF and anaplasmosis cases in different age groups of cattle using participatory approaches and clinical examinations, determining the diversity and abundance of ticks (161 cattle in 20 herds), and establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to Theileria parva and Anaplasma marginale among cattle (n = 397 in 20 herds). Clinical examinations and informant interviews showed that TBDs affected all age groups of cattle. Two-thirds of the cattle were infested with moderate (37. 3 %, 11 - 50 ticks) to abundant (28. 6 %, > 50 ticks) numbers of ticks. Out of the 10, 923 ticks collected, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (54. 4 %) was the most abundant species followed by R. decoloratus (17. 7 %), Amblyomma variegatum (12 %) and A. lepidum (11. 6 %). We collected tick species that are either rare in Uganda (A. lepidum, Hyalomma truncatum, A. gemma) or were not known to be present in the country (R. pulchellus). The true seroprevalence of antibodies to A. marginale was high (95. 1 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 91. 3 % - 98. 5 %), while that of T. parva was low (16. 5 %, 95 % CI 12. 9 % - 19. 6 %). We determined the presence of tick-borne haemoparasites among cattle and the prevalence of infections using reverse line blot (RLB) hybridisation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and characterised Theileria and Babesia species by sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the full-length 18 S rRNA gene. The RLB hybridisation assay demonstrated the presence of tick-borne haemoparasites in most cattle (99. 6 %), mostly as mixed infections (97. 5 %). The most frequently-detected species were Theileria mutans (88. 3 %, 95 % CI: 84. 6 - 92. 1 %), A. marginale (73. 8 %: 68. 3 - 79. 2 %), T. velifera (71. 3 %: 65. 8 - 76. 7 %) and Anaplasma sp. Omatjenne (63. 3 %: 57. 5 - 68. 8 %). Other virulent pathogens, namely Babesia bigemina (5. 0 %) and T. parva (2. 9 %), were also detected with RLB, but Ehrlichia ruminantium was not detected. The proportions of qPCR positive samples were 82. 9 % (A. marginale), 12. 1 % (A. centrale), 3. 3 % (T. parva), and 1. 7 % (E. ruminantium). Variations (5 to 9 nucleotides) in the 18 S rRNA gene sequences of B. bigemina were identified as compared with previously published sequences. We assessed the 16 S rRNA gene phylogeny of Anaplasma species from cattle and analysed the msp 1 α gene sequences of A. marginale to identify genotypes. There was genetic heterogeneity within A. marginale in cattle in the study area. Most A. marginale sequences (16 / 19) were closely related (99 - 100 % identities) and clustered with A. marginale strain Veld from cattle in South Africa, with strong bootstrap support, while three sequences clustered (100 % identity) with A. marginale strain from Virginia, USA. The A. centrale sequences were closely related (100 % identity) and clustered with the Israel vaccine strain. We found four different kinds of MSP 1 a tandem repeat sequences (UP 39 -F-M 2 - 3) that correspond to one A. marginale strain unique to Uganda. One tandem repeat (UP 39) was unique to Karamoja cattle. The findings from this study provide knowledge on the diversity and epidemiology of TBDs, which can be used to support diagnosis and strategic control of TBDs, and consequently improve cattle productivity and the livelihoods of pastoralists. More effective control and prevention measures against ticks and TBDs should urgently be implemented in the region. There is need to facilitate and promote immunisation of cattle against ECF. Given the scarcity of veterinarians in the region, the activities of community-based animal health workers [CAHWs] should be strengthened. The local governments in Karamoja Region should facilitate a more favourable business environment to attract private companies, who could scale-up veterinary drug supplies to the region. Pastoralists should be sensitised to improve their ecological knowledge of the seasonal activity of ticks for strategic tick control. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial {{contamination}} of raw processed poultry {{continues to be}} of concern to consumers as well as regulatory and health officials. For many years wings were considered a low-value product; therefore, shelf life of wings was not a major concern. Due to changes in consumer attitudes and increases in the fast-food market, wings are now a valuable commodity. Because wings have a shorter shelf life than most other raw poultry products, acceptable intervention to decrease the popula-tion of associated spoilage organisms and human entero-pathogens are needed. Safe 2 O Poultry Wash was evaluated as a postchill treatment to reduce microbial contamination and increase shelf life. Ninety-six carcasses were obtained from a local processor prior to final wash.
