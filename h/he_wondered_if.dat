25|$|In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond {{to write}} and record a theme song for the Scotland {{national}} football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met {{on the same day}} when working on Illuminatus! in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.|$|E
25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman {{could go to}} the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, {{as if he were trying}} to prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E

500|$|When it {{was decided}} that Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl would begin {{serialization}} in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh, Satoru Akahori wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of [...] "true love". Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi, the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ecchi or fan service.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} a colonel, Jackson {{considered}} resigning his commission. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had missed his chance for promotion to brigadier {{at the age of}} 44, and believed he might have [...] "reached [...] ceiling" [...] as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion. He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1989, after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper {{on the future of the}} Army and taking the Higher Command and Staff Course. He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade—a post he held until 1992, thus missing the Gulf War. He was promoted from Member to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{felt that}} the main story {{employed}} [...] "one of the show's most reliable running jokes". Furthermore, he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode, and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> [...] "this was a one-time thing, or if Michael's treatment of Toby will be softened, even a little." [...] Sepinwall also felt that Pam's story was the stronger of the two subplots, and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and called it [...] "pleasant". While he noted that each of the three stories [...] "weren't flat out funny", he wrote that they were all [...] "enjoyable". Furthermore, he positively commented on the main plot, noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun.|$|E

500|$|On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders {{were badly}} injured by {{a clash of}} heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the {{advertising}} and reporting of cricket after this game and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, [...] "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company {{was found to be}} insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of Orochimaru {{to the series}} was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors {{in order to improve}} the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted it to end normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advised and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] was one of his [...] "guiding principles," [...] and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a [...] "powerful aura." [...] When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is [...] "truly evil" [...] and that he is one of the several [...] "hopeless evil characters" [...] that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> that was really the way to go to make him sound strong. Then I started thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing.|$|E
500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E

500|$|Several celebrities did {{not abide}} by the rules and were banned from the club. Humphrey Bogart was banned after a {{prolonged}} [...] "shouting match" [...] with Billingsley. Milton Berle was officially barred for too much table-hopping, shouting, and doing handsprings in the club; Berle contended that the real reason was because of a Stork Club satire he had recently performed on his television program. Elliott Roosevelt, the so-called [...] "black sheep of the club", became unwelcome at the club through an apparent misunderstanding. [...] Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girlfriend, vocalist Gigi Durston, {{on the basis of}} the couple's friends' statements that they were going to be married. [...] Durston had once worked at the Stork Club as a singer and Roosevelt was a longtime customer of the club. [...] Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time. Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled. Jackie Gleason, who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters, was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957. Billingsley claimed that Gleason's conversation became loud and off-color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the Stork Club for life. [...] Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> the problem was because he was a member of the Musicians' Union, since the club's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell was {{struggling}} {{to set up a}} practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. [...] After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line. [...] When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. [...] The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant. [...] The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.|$|E

[...] However, he hoped that Carl would have redeeming qualities {{and that he would}} not be [...] "a total arch-villain". He also compared Carl to William Shakespeare's Iago (from Othello), and said Carl is a film fan who would compare himself to Al Pacino in films such as Scarface and The Godfather. He also said Carl presents [...] "different fronts to different people" [...] and opined that there is [...] "a bit of nice in him", but he likes to dominate, make money and have influence, and would not be good until he achieves that. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> Carl would be capable of settling down and starting a family. On playing a villain, Coonan said, [...] "It is good fun playing the bad guys. They are the always the best to play. They do not care how people perceive them. They do not have the normal social restrictions." [...] He said that Carl is [...] "slightly psychotic" [...] and is [...] "the sort of person who finds it genuinely heartwarming to see people suffer". In October 2013, Coonan said that Carl had been [...] "an absolute bastard" [...] during his six months in the show.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{team were}} the first not to travel to Australia entirely by ship. Instead they flew to Aden and boarded the luxury liner Canberra on its maiden voyage to Australia, which became an 11-day {{cocktail}} party, with Tom Graveney {{in charge of the}} bar and Graveney, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington, Colin Cowdrey, Ray Illingworth and Fred Trueman forming the Marylebone Calypso Club, much to the amusement of the other passengers. Dexter found that the British Olympic long distance runner Gordon Pirie was on board (the Commonwealth Games were being held in Perth, Western Australia in November 1962) and got him to arrange keep fit classes for the team and runs around the deck in return for a first class berth. Trueman first avoided these by dodging down a corridor as short-cut and when was discovered threatening to throw Pirie overboard. He complained to the assistant-manager Alec Bedser that he had just bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire, was the best fast-bowler in the world and did not need extra training, Bedser agreed and Trueman was excused. The team also needed to sign autographs for an hour each day, but Trueman's occasionally fell out of a porthole. The Canberra docked at Colombo for a one-day game, where David Sheppard made 73 and Ray Illingworth took 5/59. The Duke of Norfolk joined them here with three of his daughters [...] "You may dance with my daughters. You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that is all you may do", though Colin Cowdrey later married Lady Anne Elizabeth Fitzalan-Howard. The team arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia on 9 October, where they met Brian Statham, who had flown in the day before. Pirie wrote a press article to the effect that the England team were lazy, unfit and overweight; Dexter wrote an article in response, announcing that he hoped that his team would make 60 runs an hour and bowl 15 overs an hour on the tour, an ambitious target and one that he would fail to meet, though the England run rate of 39 runs per 100 balls was the highest since the war (Australia managed 41 per 100 balls). Dexter donated the fee from his article to a team kitty, to be shared amongst the players. Trueman's inflammatory remarks to The Sydney Morning Herald (<b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> they would be playing under Jockey Club rules - referring to the Duke of Norfolk's interest in horse-racing - or going on a Church Mission - because the Reverend David Sheppard was on the tour) went down badly with the MCC. As the most colourful of the England players Trueman was offered eight times his tour fee of £250 to give after-dinner speeches and endorse products. On being told that if he did he would have to give the money to the kitty, he turned down the offer, annoyed by the fact that Susan Dexter was supposedly earning more from her modelling work than any of the cricketers. Though Trueman struck up a friendship with the Duke, Bedser was a stickler for team discipline and Trueman would be docked his £50 good conduct bonus {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E
