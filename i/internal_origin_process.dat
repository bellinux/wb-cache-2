The main purpose is to investigate the mechanism of such late-time flares based on the <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> assumption. In the hyper-accreting black hole (BH) scenario, we study the possibility of two well-known mechanisms as the central engine to power such X-ray flares, i. e., the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation and the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. Our {{results show that the}} annihilation luminosity is far below the observational data. Thus, the annihilation mechanism cannot account for such late-time flares. For the BZ process, if the role of outflows is taken into consideration, the inflow mass rate near the horizon will be quite low such that the magnetic field will probably be too weak to power the observed X-ray flares. We therefore argue that, for the late-time flares with <b>internal</b> <b>origin,</b> the central engine is unlikely to be associated with BHs. On the contrary, a fast rotating neutron star with strong bipolar magnetic fields may be responsible for such flares. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{availability}} of multi-wavelength data revealed {{the presence of}} large reservoirs of warm and cold gas and dust in the innermost regions {{of the majority of}} massive elliptical galaxies. To prove an <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> of cold and warm gas, the investigation of the spatially distributed cooling process which occurs because of non-linear density perturbations and subsequent thermal instabilities is of crucial importance. The first goal of this work of thesis is to investigate the <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> of warm and cold phases. Numerical simulations are the powerful tool of analysis. The way in which a spatially distributed cooling process originates has been examined and the off-centre amount of gas mass which cools when different and differently characterized AGN feedback mechanisms operate has been quantified. This thesis demonstrates that the aforementioned non-linear density perturbations originate and develop from AGN feedback mechanisms in a natural fashion. An <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> of the warm phase from the once hot gas is shown to be possible. Computed velocity dispersions of ionized and hot gas are similar. The cold gas as well can originate from the cooling process: indeed, {{it has been estimated that}} the surrounding stellar radiation, which is one of the most feasible sources of ionization of the warm gas, does not manage to keep ionized all the gas at 10 ^ 4 K. Therefore, cooled gas does undergo a further cooling which can lead the warm phase to lower temperatures. However, the gas which has cooled from the hot phase is expected to be dustless; nonetheless, a large fraction of early type galaxies has detectable dust in their cores, both concentrated in filamentary and disky structures and spread over larger regions. Therefore a regularly rotating disk of cold and dusty gas has been included in the simulations. A new quantitative investigation of the spatially distributed cooling process has therefore been essential: the contribution of the included amount of dust which is embedded in the cold gas does have a role in promoting and enhancing the cooling. The fate of dust which was at first embedded in cold gas has been investigated. The role of AGN feedback mechanisms in dragging (if able) cold and dusty gas from the core of massive ellipticals up to large radii has been studied. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Earth’s {{magnetic}} field is mainly produced within the Earth’s liquid and electrically conductingcore, {{as a result}} of a process known as the geodynamo. Many other sources alsocontribute to the magnetic signal accessible to observation at the Earth’s surface, partly obscuringthe main core {{magnetic field}} signal. Thanks to a series of very successful satellites andto advances in magnetic field modelling techniques, considerable progress has, however, beenmade in the recent years toward better identifying the signal of each of these sources. In particular,temporal changes in the field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> happen to be detectable now in sphericalharmonic degrees up to, perhaps, 16. All of these changes are usually attributed to changesin the core field itself, the secular variation, on the ground that the lithospheric magnetizationcannot produce such signals. It has, however, been pointed out, on empirical grounds, thattemporal changes in the field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> produced by the induced part of the lithosphericmagnetization could dominate the core field signal beyond degree 22. This short note revisitsthis issue by taking advantage of our improved knowledge of the small-scale field changes andof the likely sources of the lithospheric field. We rely on a simple extrapolation of the observedspatial spectrum of the field changes beyond degree 16 and use a forward approach based on arecent geological model of lithospheric magnetization. This leads us to confirm that the maincause of the observed changes in the field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin</b> up to some critical degree, NC,is indeed likely to be the secular variation of the core field, but that the signal produced bythe time-varying lithospheric field is bound to dominate and conceal the time-varying coresignal beyond that critical degree, in very much the same way the permanent component of thelithospheric field dominates and conceals the permanent component of the core field beyonddegree 14. All uncertainties taken into account, we estimate NC to lie between 22 and 24. We, however, also note that in practice, the main limitation to the observation of the corefield small-scale secular variation is not so much its concealing by the field of lithosphericorigin but its fast changing nature and small magnitude. This leads us to conclude that whereascumulative small-scale lithospheric field changes might be detected some day, detection ofcore-field secular variation beyond degree 18 is likely to remain a severe challenge for sometim...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of tracing along magnetic field lines {{is widely used}} in magnetospheric physics to provide a "magnetic frame of reference' that facilitates both the planning of experiments and the interpretation of observations. The precision of any such magnetic frame of reference depends critically on the accurate representation of the various sources of magnetic field in the magnetosphere. In order to consider this important problem systematically, a study is initiated to estimate first the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing in the magnetosphere that arise solely from the published (standard) errors in the specification of the geomagnetic field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin.</b> Because of the complexity in computing these uncertainties for the complete geomagnetic field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin,</b> attention is focused in this preliminary paper on the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing that result from the standard errors in just the axisymmetric part of the internal geomagnetic field. An exact analytic equation exists for the magnetic field lines of an arbitrary linear combination of axisymmetric multipoles. This equation is used to derive numerical estimates of the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing that are due to the published standard errors in the axisymmetric spherical harmonic coefficients (i. e. g n 0 ± δg n 0). Numerical results determined from the analytic equation are compared with computational results based on stepwise numerical integration along magnetic field lines. Excellent agreement is obtained between the analytical and computational methods in the axisymmetric case, which provides great confidence in {{the accuracy of the}} computer program used for stepwise numerical integration along magnetic field lines. This computer program is then used in the following paper to estimate the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing in the magnetosphere that arise from the published standard errors in the full set of spherical harmonic coefficients, which define the complete (non-axisymmetric) geomagnetic field of <b>internal</b> <b>origin.</b> Numerical estimates of the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing in the magnetosphere, calculated here for the axisymmetric part of the internal geomagnetic field, should be regarded as "first approximations' in the sense that such estimates are only as accurate as the published standard errors in the set of axisymmetric spherical harmonic coefficients. However, all procedures developed in this preliminary paper {{can be applied to the}} derivation of more realistic estimates of the uncertainties in magnetic-field-line tracing in the magnetosphere, following further progress in the determination of more accurate standard errors in the spherical harmonic coefficients...|$|R
