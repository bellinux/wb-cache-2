5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the <b>fingerboard</b> of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} Hyattstown, MD355 crosses into Frederick County, where it becomes Urbana Pike. Here, it passes some {{businesses}} before intersecting MD 75 (Green Valley Road). Past this intersection, the road continues {{into a more}} rural setting consisting of farmland, woods, and some residential areas and businesses. The route reaches Urbana, where it heads onto a four lane divided bypass called Worthington Boulevard {{to the east of}} the community, while the former alignment of MD355 continues through Urbana as MD 355 Bus. MD355 intersects MD 80 (<b>Fingerboard</b> Road) and passes through residential areas in the Villages of Urbana subdivision, encountering two roundabouts. Upon leaving Urbana, the route intersects MD 355 Bus. again and returns to its original alignment on two-lane undivided Urbana Pike as it continues north through areas of woods and farms with some rural residences. The road passes Monocacy National Battlefield, the site of the Battle of Monocacy Junction in the American Civil War fought on July 9, 1864. Past the battlefield, the road crosses the Monocacy River and a CSX railroad line.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic violins may be {{used with}} an add-on {{piezoelectric}} bridge or body pickup, or a magnetic pickup attached to the <b>fingerboard</b> end. Alternatively, an electrodynamic pickup can be installed under an acoustic violin's <b>fingerboard</b> avoiding interference with any tone-producing parts of the violin, and therefore keeping its acoustic resonances and tone intact.|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} guitars {{that were made}} {{completely}} in shop were SG- or Les-Paul-shaped, featured 24-fret <b>fingerboards,</b> and a black or white finish. At first, the <b>fingerboards</b> were Brazilian rosewood, but eventually the expensive and rare Brazilian Rosewood was replaced with more plentiful and cheap maple <b>fingerboards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Classical <b>fingerboards</b> are {{normally}} flat and without inlaid fret markers, or just have dot inlays {{on the side}} of the neck - steel string <b>fingerboards</b> usually have a slight radius and inlays.|$|R
50|$|Classical guitars, some 12-string guitars, banjos, dobros, pedal steel, {{and a few}} steel {{stringed}} acoustic guitars have flat <b>fingerboards.</b> Almost {{all other}} guitars have at least some curvature. However some recent five and six string electric basses have flat <b>fingerboards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Intertwined {{with the}} Neapolitan style is the Roman style mandolin, which has {{influenced}} it. The Roman mandolin had a <b>fingerboard</b> {{that was more}} curved and narrow. The <b>fingerboard</b> was lengthened over the sound hole for the E strings, the high pitched strings. The shape {{of the back of}} the neck was different, less rounded with an edge, the bridge was curved making the G strings higher. The Roman mandolin had mechanical tuning gears before the Neapolitan.|$|E
25|$|All fourths tuning E2–A2–D3–G3–C4–F4 {{keeps the}} lowest four strings of {{standard}} tuning, changing the major third {{to a perfect}} fourth. Jazzmusician StanleyJordan stated that all-fourths tuning “simplifies the <b>fingerboard,</b> making it logical”.|$|E
25|$|Sul ponticello ("on the bridge") {{refers to}} bowing {{closer to the}} bridge, while sul tasto ("on the fingerboard") calls for bowing nearer {{the end of the}} <b>fingerboard.</b> Sul tasto {{produces}} a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.|$|E

25|$|Psychobilly bassists {{often use}} gut strings, {{to get the}} deep, low 1950s tone. Like rockabilly bassists, psychobilly bassists often use both a bridge pickup and a <b>fingerboard</b> pickup, with the latter being used to pick up {{slapping}} and percussive sounds. Psychobilly bassists often decorate their basses by painting them with retro pin-up style images or designs or by putting stickers on them.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Carvin {{worked with}} Becker {{to design the}} JB200C Jason Becker Tribute, a guitar that is modeled after the {{original}} DC200 guitar he used toward {{the latter part of}} his career. The guitar features an Alder body with flamed maple top, maple neck with a flamed maple <b>fingerboard,</b> a Floyd Rose tremolo, jumbo frets, 2 humbuckers, active electronics, and comes standard in a transparent blue finish.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>fingerboarding</b> was {{a novelty}} within the skateboarding {{industry}} for years, as skateboarding reached enormous and widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s, the folks at toymaker Spin Master realized {{the potential for the}} toys, and specifically for products bearing the logos and branding of real skateboarding brands. Their Tech Deck brand caught on during this period and has grown into a widely recognized brand itself in the toy business. Toy <b>fingerboards</b> like the ones Tech Deck manufactures are now available as inexpensive novelty toys as well as high-end collectibles, complete with accessories one would find in use with standard-size skateboards. <b>Fingerboards</b> are also used by skateboarders as 3-D model visual aids to understand potential tricks and maneuvers; many users make videos to document their efforts.|$|R
25|$|He was a {{representative}} of the playing tradition stopping the strings along the neck but without frets. Veresay's instrument had six single unstopped strings mounted along the treble side of the instrument and six stoppable strings strung along the neck. The strings strung along the neck and side are plucked by the right hand with the left hand stopping the strings on the <b>fingerboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dragonetti {{was known}} for his {{formidable}} strength and stamina. It was particularly important {{at a time when the}} role of the double bass in the orchestra was to assist the concertmaster in maintaining the cohesion and establishing the tempo. He had huge hands with strong, broad fingers, which allowed him to play with a taller bridge and strings twice as far from the <b>fingerboard</b> as the other bassists.|$|E
25|$|Other American-made {{variants}} {{include the}} mandolinetto or Howe-Orme guitar-shaped mandolin (manufactured by the Elias Howe Company between 1897 and roughly 1920), which featured a cylindrical bulge {{along the top}} from <b>fingerboard</b> end to tailpiece and the Vega mando-lute (more commonly called a cylinder-back mandolin manufactured by the Vega Company between 1913 and roughly 1927), which had a similar longitudinal bulge but on the back rather than {{the front of the}} instrument.|$|E
50|$|Wechter builds many guitars {{with his}} Pathmaker design, an {{acoustic}} guitar {{with a double}} cutaway. Some of his guitars have drone strings and scalloped <b>fingerboards.</b> In 1976, he collaborated with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin to create the Shakti guitar, which was used by McLaughlin in his band Shakti. The Shakti guitar is a customized Gibson J-200 with drone strings transversely across the soundhole. He also made him a guitar with scalloped <b>fingerboards.</b>|$|R

25|$|Cantrell {{has been}} most famously seen playing a G Guitars' Rampage model. The two models most closely {{identified}} with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s. They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony <b>fingerboard.</b> The bridge is a Kahler Tremolo {{as opposed to a}} Floyd Rose tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s. The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker wired to a volume pickup.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the oud {{belongs to}} the family of short scale lutes. The widest interval that can be stopped between the open string {{and the end of the}} <b>fingerboard</b> is a fifth (quint); though it is possible to play wider intervals on the same string by stopping tones on the top of the corpus. Although Bashir has not invented this slightly unorthodox technique, he has integrated it into his style in an exemplary manner.|$|E
25|$|The neck (Sap) is a mince (only 4-4.5cm in diameter) 100–110cm long D-section <b>fingerboard</b> made {{of light}} wood and carries catgut frets {{adjusted}} to give 36 intervals in an octave. Catgut frets are {{fixed on the}} neck by means of minute nails. The main bridge is trapezoidal and mobile, and since the shell lacks braces to support the soundboard, the latter slightly yields in under the bridge. The smaller upper bridge between the pegbox and the neck is traditionally made of bone.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Gibson did {{a limited}} run of 1957 reissue Customs (both 2 and 3 pickup models) with ebony <b>fingerboards.</b> These {{were the only}} Customs since 2011 to feature ebony <b>fingerboards,</b> and came with white {{handling}} gloves, a 20th anniversary toggle switch control cover, a special COA and a Gibson Custom case. In 2012, Gibson reintroduced the original brown and pink [...] "California girl" [...] case for its Custom Shop models, largely replacing the black and red case {{that had been in}} use for years.|$|R
50|$|Several musical {{instrument}} makers employ wenge in their products. Alembic Guitars {{have used this}} wood on numerous occasions for custom instruments. Mosrite used it for bodies of their Brass Rail models. Ibanez and Cort use it for the five-piece necks {{of some of their}} electric basses. Warwick electric basses use FSC sourced wenge for <b>fingerboards</b> and necks as of 2013. Conklin Guitars and Basses makes use of wenge for bodies, <b>fingerboards</b> and necks. Crush drums use it on their limited reserve wenge drum kit. It is also used by Yamaha as the center ply of their Absolute Hybrid Maple drums.|$|R
25|$|Strings run between {{mechanical}} tuning machines {{at the top}} of the neck to a tailpiece that anchors the other end of the strings. The strings are suspended over the neck and soundboard and pass over a floating bridge. The bridge is kept in contact with the soundboard by the downward pressure from the strings. The neck is either flat or has a slight radius, and is covered with a <b>fingerboard</b> with frets. The action of the strings on the bridge causes the soundboard to vibrate, producing sound.|$|E
25|$|A {{polyphonic}} {{member of}} the guitar family, the Chapman Stick is an electric musical instrument used for music recordings to play various parts such as bass, lead, chords, and textures. The Chapman Stick looks like a wide version of the fretboard of an electric guitar, but having 8, 10 or 12 strings. The player will use both hands to sound notes by striking the strings against the <b>fingerboard</b> just behind the appropriate frets for the desired notes. The Chapman Stick was invented in 1969 by American jazz musician Emmett Chapman.|$|E
25|$|The modern five-string banjo is a {{variation}} on Sweeney's original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three quarters {{the length of the}} other strings. This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a reentrant tuning—the string pitches don't proceed lowest to highest across the <b>fingerboard.</b> Instead, the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is highest.|$|E
50|$|Hangboards {{are usually}} mounted above a doorway, or {{anywhere}} {{that allows the}} user's body to hang freely, {{one of the best}} available attachment areas is to roof beams. They are also called <b>fingerboards.</b>|$|R
