5|$|After her death, 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur {{became the}} oldest {{recognized}} living person. Both {{before and after}} Calment's death, {{there have been several}} claims to have surpassed <b>her</b> <b>age</b> (see Unverified longevity claims), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> most important women's roles were out of <b>her</b> <b>age</b> range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
5|$|In 1240, {{she married}} Raoul of Nesle {{who was about}} half of <b>her</b> <b>age</b> at the time. The High Court of Jerusalem proclaimed Alice and her husband regents for Conrad in 1243, but their power was only nominal. Raoul of Nesle left the kingdom, and Alice, {{before the end of}} the year. Alice {{retained}} the title of regent until her death in 1246.|$|E

5|$|In {{her early}} teens, Mina was a {{competitive}} swimmer for the Canottieri Baldesio sports club in Cremona, attended by the elite of the Cremonese bourgeoisie at the time.

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Alkin until 1645; because of {{comments}} of <b>her</b> <b>age</b> made later in life, her date of birth is taken to be around 1600. She was the wife of Francis Alkin, a spy for the Parliamentarians who was hanged early in the English Civil War by royalist forces for his activities. She {{was the mother of}} three children.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many women}} of her era, Stanton was {{formally}} educated. She attended Johnstown Academy {{until the age}} of 16, where she studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, religion, science, French, and writing. At the Academy, she enjoyed being in co-educational classes where she could compete intellectually and academically with boys <b>her</b> <b>age</b> and older.

5|$|When Min was 13, {{she lied}} about <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> {{saying she was}} 14, {{to get a job}} at McDonald's. In middle school and at Heritage High School, she contributed to the schools' student newspapers. Min worked at a {{clothing}} store in a local mall, became a cashier at Target, and sold cosmetics at Foley's during a summer break in college. She interned one summer at MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} {{in about two}} minutes. The ship was in poor {{condition}} at the time due to <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. The destruction of the ship caught the Allies by surprise; her loss came {{during the height of}} the bombardment. Torpedo boats and other smaller vessels rushed to pick up survivors, but they rescued only a handful of men. From her complement of 710 men, some 660 were killed in the sinking.|$|E

5|$|Brennus {{continued}} {{on in the}} Reserve Squadron through 1907, during which time she was again the flagship of Vice Admiral Fournier. Fournier was {{the commander in chief}} of the annual summer maneuvers, which began in late June and concluded on 4 August 1907. The following year, the Mediterranean Fleet was reorganized into three squadrons; Brennus again repeated her role as flagship, of the Third Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Germinet. Due to <b>her</b> <b>age</b> and condition by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Brennus was not mobilized and did not see action. Brennus was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1919 and sold for scrapping in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian route. In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route. In 1928, though, Suevic was showing <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling factory ship. She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E

She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not because she wanted to be on TV.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the skull plates come together placed <b>her</b> <b>age</b> at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
5|$|In {{relations}} with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Gillard represented Australia at the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in London in April 2011 and hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth in October of that year. The Perth CHOGM saw the historic announcement, by Gillard and British Prime Minister David Cameron, of changes to the succession laws regarding to thrones of the Commonwealth realms, overturning rules privileging male over female heirs {{to the line of}} succession and removing a ban on Roman Catholic consorts. At the CHOGM, Gillard also hosted Queen Elizabeth II, for what was suggested to be the Monarch's final visit to Australia, due to <b>her</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E

5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (<b>her</b> <b>age</b> is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for <b>her</b> <b>age</b> group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was {{admitted}} to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day.
