30|$|Experimentally, {{only one}} {{combination}} produced maximum calorific value (Table  3). From the curve, {{it is found}} that several combinations of NaCl concentrations and chloroform are likely to produce the same line. It can be observed that an extremely smaller portion on the curve in right corner consists of <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value (9260  kcal/kg) zones and smaller lower calorific value (9120  kcal/kg) zone at the left corner. It is found that a <b>higher</b> <b>calorific</b> value zone could be obtained using a NaCl concentrations range of 0.76 – 0.80  % and chloroform range of 196 – 198  ml, while a lower calorific value zone resulted from a NaCl concentrations range of 0.78 – 0.80  % and chloroform range of 120 – 130  ml.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of energetic {{characteristics such as}} <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value (on ash-free dry weight basis), ash, carbon, nitrogen, and moisture content of 12 indigenous tree and shrub species of Southern Italy (Basilicata Region) was carried out. The studied species are the most abundant in this area: Quercus cerris L., Quercus pubescens Willd., Fraxinus ornus L., Populus canescens (Aiton) Smith, Salix alba L., Alnus cordata L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Olea europaea L., Spartium junceum L., Rubus hirtus W., Onopordum illirium L., Arundo donax L. For Q. cerris, Q. pubescens and O. europaea L., the energetic characteristics were measured by separating the wood components from the leaves. Q. cerris leaves contained the greatest <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value. F. ornus leaves had a greater ash content than the other samples while the lowest values were measured for S. junceum, Q. pubescens and R. pseudoacacia. The highest content of Carbon was in O. europaea leaves. A. donax and O. illirium had the lower level of <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value and Carbon {{than all the other}} species.

50|$|This is {{complicated}} by the fact that there are two different ways to measure the fuel energy input—LCV = Lower Calorific Value, which is the same as NCV = Net Calorific Value, or, HCV = <b>Higher</b> <b>Calorific</b> Value which is the same as GCV, Gross Calorific Value.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of biomass}} {{briquettes}} {{has been steadily}} increasing as industries realize the benefits of decreasing pollution {{through the use of}} biomass briquettes. Briquettes provide <b>higher</b> <b>calorific</b> value per dollar than coal when used for firing industrial boilers. Along with <b>higher</b> <b>calorific</b> value, biomass briquettes on average saved 30-40% of boiler fuel cost. But other sources suggest that cofiring is more expensive due to the widespread availability of coal and its low cost. However, in the long run, briquettes can only limit the use of coal to a small extent, but it is increasingly being pursued by industries and factories all over the world. Both raw materials can be produced or mined domestically in the United States, creating a fuel source that is free from foreign dependence and less polluting than raw fossil fuel incineration.|$|R
40|$|The calorific, ash, {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} content, length and dry weight were determined for the hyperiid Parathemisto gaudichaudi (Guerin). Regression equations {{for all these}} variables were determined {{so that they can}} be estimated by calculation from measurements of length of the hyperiid. Mean values for total nitrogen and carbon were 7. 79 ± 0. 85 % and 36. 80 ± 4. 18 % of the dry weight, respectively. The carbon to calorific equivalent for P. gaudichaudi was 10. 37 kcal g- 1 carbon (9. 13 kcal g- 1 when corrected for nitrogen). The calorific value for ash-free adult P. gaudichaudi was 5. 138 kcal g- 1 ± 1. 309 (4. 510 kcal g- 1 when corrected for nitrogen). This large variation in the <b>calorific</b> content (<b>coefficient</b> of variation of 25. 84 %) can be accounted for largely by variation in the ash content (coefficient of variation of 21. 84 %). The calorific value determined for P. gaudichaudi is similar to that measured for other carnivorous crustaceans and adds support to the hypothesis that animals with <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> content have a low fecundity and an energy-rich store which can be used as a buffer during unfavourable periods in their life...|$|R

40|$|When {{galvanized}} steel scrap is recycled, zinc containing EAF dusts are produced. The dominant recycling route for these dusts is the Waelz process, which produces a Zn rich dust suitable for Zn metal recovery.

Limited {{work has been done}} however on the recovery of iron from the slag and the use of <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value wastes to also include energy recovery. The aim of the current project is to investigate the potential in developing a pyrometallurgical treatment of EAF dusts making use of wastes with a <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> value and generating a ZnO material suitable for Zn recovery, liquid metallic iron and a slag to be used in a high value application. nrpages: 134 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Pre-treatments of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{are common}} in all {{developed}} countries.

The purpose of this work is to study some geotechnical and biochemical aspects of four final fractions resulting from MBT of MSW, in order to outline waste managing strategies in relation to typology and impact of the pretreatments. After a trade analysis, tests were performed on compressibility, biological stability and leachability of the main contaminants.

40|$|Abstract: Ignition {{sensitivity}} {{is one of}} {{the factors}} defining the characteristics of <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> mixture with low emission of gaseous product. It was found that Zr-BaCrO 4 mixture is sensitive to ignition by electric spark energy of 0. 82 J, whereas activation of Fe-KClO 4 mixture depends on the iron powder employed and the composition of its surface oxide layers. Energy required for the activation of <b>high</b> <b>calorific</b> mixture in form of powder designated as FeK, FeR or FeE is equal to 0. 08, 0. 59 and 1. 1 J, while in the form of pellet 6. 92, 10. 2 and 14. 1 J.
