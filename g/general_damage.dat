5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests. As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In <b>general,</b> <b>damage</b> from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year. Madagascar's National Emergency Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In <b>general,</b> <b>damage</b> occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E
25|$|In November 1943 Bomber Command began {{what became}} known as the Battle of Berlin: a series of massive raids on Berlin that lasted until March 1944. Harris sought to {{duplicate}} the victory at Hamburg, but Berlin proved to be a far more difficult target. Although severe <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> was inflicted, the city was much better prepared than Hamburg, and no firestorm was ever ignited. Anti-aircraft defences were also extremely effective and bomber losses were high; during this time the British lost 1,047 bombers, with a further 1,682 damaged, culminating in the disastrous raid on Nuremberg on 30 March 1944, when 94 bombers were shot down and 71 damaged, out of 795 aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} results of a {{comprehensive}} quantitative analysis of <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> awards issued by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario from 2000 to 2015. From the results, the authors argue that <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> awards continue to be too low to reflect the importance of the equality rights protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code. While many expected that <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> awards would increase as a result of amendments to the Code that took effect in 2008, the data reveals that the range of the vast majority of <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> awards has remained relatively unchanged following the legislative reforms. After adjusting for inflation, the data reveals that the range has decreased in real terms. The authors consider what steps the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, the Human Rights Legal Support Centre, the courts and the legislature might take to increase the size of <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> awards. The authors also argue that <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> need to be increased to reflect the magnitude of discriminatory harms and to promote a culture of human rights compliance...|$|R
50|$|Damages are {{categorized}} as either special or general. In torts, special damages are measurable costs {{which can be}} itemized such as medical expenses, lost earnings, and property <b>damages</b> whereas <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> include less measurable costs such as pain and suffering, loss of consortium, the effects of defamation, and emotional distress. Personal injury torts may result in claims for both special and <b>general</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|R

500|$|In <b>general,</b> <b>damage</b> from Tropical Storm Carrie and its extratropical {{remnants}} was light. Total monetary {{damage was}} estimated at $1,780,000 in 1972 terms, of which $1,200,000 in losses was inflicted on Massachusetts. Losses totaled $350,000 in Rhode Island, $200,000 in Maine, and $30,000 in New Hampshire. Four fatalities were attributed to the storm: two {{in the aftermath of}} boating accidents in Massachusetts, and two due to rough surf along the coast of Maine. In the aftermath, a local disaster area was declared for the town of Plymouth. The weakening remnants of Carrie produced strong winds throughout New Brunswick on September 5 and 6, peaking at [...] In Saint John, where wind gusts reached , there were reports of downed telephone wires and trees. Widespread power outages occurred throughout communities in the province. Only light rain fell in Saint John, and no flooding was evident. The storm damaged or destroyed numerous boats in Charlo, New Brunswick.|$|E
60|$|But Peter Winn was a {{very busy}} man, with such large plans {{in his head and}} with so many reins in his hands that he quickly forgot the incident. Three nights later the left wing of his country house was blown up. It was not a heavy explosion, and nobody was hurt, though the wing itself was ruined.

Lastly, where the plaintiff proves only minimal loss or damage, or the court or jury is unable to quantify the losses, the court or jury may award nominal damages.|$|E

50|$|High heating {{efficiencies}} on closed appliances {{can only}} be attained by controlling the supply of air to the fire chamber (operating the air control correctly). It is not recommended to leave the air control fully open, except when helping the chimney/flue heat up initially. A fully open air control {{will lead to more}} heat being sent straight up the chimney rather than into the room (which reduces efficiency). The biggest problem with leaving the air control fully open is “overfiring”. Overfiring is caused when too much heat is generated within the fire chamber, which will lead to warping, buckling and <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> to the stove and its internal components. Individual stoves will have their own quirks, so it is necessary to learn each new stove's settings.|$|E

25|$|<b>Damages</b> may be <b>general</b> or consequential. <b>General</b> <b>damages</b> {{are those}} damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. <b>General</b> <b>damages</b> would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|R
50|$|Cox {{also tried}} to assert {{immunity}} under Oregon's retraction statutes, which state that <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> for defamation could only be awarded if the plaintiffs had sought a retraction, which Padrick had not.
