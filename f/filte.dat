40|$|Filtering {{methods of}} {{ensemble}} data assimilation {{have been tested}} using two numerical models of different complexity: a simple Lorenz L 96 model and a complicated numerical weather prediction model COAMPS in twin-experiments set-up. Ensemble data assimilation systems transform a forecast ensemble into an analysis ensemble with appriopriate statistics. We applied a deterministic analysis ensemble update, which is a Monte Carlo implementation of Kalman square root filters. Ensemble square-root <b>filtes</b> generate the analysis ensemble by adding an analysis ensemble of perturbations to the analysis ensemble mean. The ensemble of analysis perturbations Xa is a square root of the scaled analysis covariance matrix (k – 1) Pa. Errors can be introduced at each step of data assimilation algorithms. In the following paragraphs the COAMPS forecast model set-up and details of a reference simulation are described together with some information on features of the filter used and results of the control experiment runs. Finally, after briefly discussing the sources of errors in ensemble filters we concentrated {{on the problem of}} sampling errors in the relationship between the observations and model state variables.
