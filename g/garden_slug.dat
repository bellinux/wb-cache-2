They occupied the fifth floor of the Gotham Theatre on West Forty-second Street. As there was no lift in the building except the small private one used by the two members of the firm, Jill walked up the stairs, and found signs of a thriving business beginning to present themselves as early as the third floor, where half a dozen patient persons of either sex had draped themselves like roosting fowls upon the banisters. There were more on the fourth floor, and the landing of the fifth, which served the firm as a waiting-room, was quite full. It is the custom of New York theatrical managers--the lowest order of intelligence, {{with the possible exception of}} the limax maximus or <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> known to science--to omit from their calculations the fact that they are likely every day to receive a large number of visitors, whom they will be obliged to keep waiting; and that these people will require somewhere to wait. Such considerations never occur to them. Messrs. Goble and Cohn had provided for those who called to see them one small bench on the landing, conveniently situated at the intersecting point of three draughts, and had let it go at that.|$|E

5000|$|According to an 1896 {{paper by}} Charles Sedgwick Minot of the Harvard Medical School, {{the origin of}} the author-date style is {{attributed}} to a paper by Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey professor of anatomy and director of the zoological laboratory at Harvard University, who may have copied it from the cataloguing system used then and now by the library of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1881 Mark wrote a paper on the embryogenesis of the <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> in which he included an author-date citation in parentheses on page 194, the first known instance of such a reference. Until then, according to Eli Chernin writing in the British Medical Journal, references had appeared in inconsistent styles in footnotes, referred to in the text using a variety of printers' symbols, including asterisks and daggers. Chernin writes that a 1903 festschrift dedicated to Mark by 140 students, including Theodore Roosevelt, confirms that the author-date system is attributable to Mark. The festschrift pays tribute to Mark's 1881 paper, writing that it [...] "introduced into zoology a proper fullness and accuracy of citation and a convenient and uniform method of referring from text to bibliography." [...] According to an editorial note in the British Medical Journal in 1945, an unconfirmed anecdote is that the term [...] "Harvard system" [...] was introduced by an English visitor to Harvard University library, who was impressed by the citation system and dubbed it [...] "Harvard system" [...] upon his return to England.|$|E

In this study, we {{examined}} the nature of latex in Lactarius Pers. 1797 spp. to clarify the role on fungivorous predation. In the field, we compared the degree of predation on taxonomically closely related latex-exuding Lactarius spp. and latex-non-exuding Russula Pers. 1796 spp. (Russulaceae) at developmental stages of sporocarps. We clarified that Russula spp. suffered more infestation than did Lactarius spp. at young and mature developmental stages, whereas Lactarius spp. did only at decaying stages. We measured the amount of latex exuded varied according to developmental stage and sporocarps parts in Lactarius spp. : mature sporocarps exuded more latex than did younger ones, while decaying sporocarps exuded the least, and the same patterns were observed at sporocarps parts: the amount of latex was more intense at hymenophore and cap than at stripe.

40|$|Parched {{and ground}} whole <b>garden</b> <b>slugs</b> are claimed in rural Jamaican {{folklore}} practices to have useful {{effects in the}} treatment of bronchial asthma. Since this claim may be associated with respiratory dysfunction due to histamine from allergic sensitization, the authors investigated the effects of a semi-pure alcoholic extract (AST- 1) on histamine-induced contraction of the guinea pig in vitro tracheal muscle preparation and cutaneous allergic responses in ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs. Chemical analysis of AST- 1 by column chromatography and thin layer chromatography indicated two compounds in the composition, but the molecular structures were not determined. Pharmacological evaluation of AST- 1 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine-induced contraction of the guinea pig tracheal muscle preparation. AST- 1 also inhibited contraction of the tracheal muscle produced by selective H 1 receptor stimulation with HTMT dimaleate. H 2 receptors were not involved, as indicated by the absence of contraction with dimaprit hydrochloride, a selective H 2 agonist. Also, in ovalbumin sensitized guinea pigs, AST- 1 and diphenhydramine, a selective H 1 antagonist, inhibited the cutaneous responses due to intradermal injection of histamine and ovalbumin. These results suggest that AST- 1 has H 1 anti-histamine properties which can inhibit histamine-induced tracheobronchial muscle contraction and cutaneous responses due to allergy...|$|R

50|$|Diatomite {{is used as}} an insecticide, due to its {{abrasive}} and physico-sorptive properties. The fine powder absorbs lipids {{from the}} waxy outer layer of insects' exoskeletons, causing them to dehydrate. Arthropods die {{as a result of}} the water pressure deficiency, based on Fick's law of diffusion. This also works against gastropods and is commonly employed in <b>gardening</b> to defeat <b>slugs.</b> However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. It is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness. The shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the absorption of liquids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, do work best when a particular shaped diatom is used. For example, in the case of slugs and snails large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo ecdysis in shedding cuticle, such as arthropods or nematodes. It may have some effect also on lophotrochozoans, such as mollusks or annelids.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Understanding the {{physiological}} basis of environmental regulation of reproduction at the cellular level {{has been difficult}} or unfeasible in vertebrate species because of the highly complex and diffuse nature of vertebrate neuroendocrine systems. This {{is not the case}} with the simple nervous system of mollusks in which reproductive neuroendocrine cells are often readily identifiable in living tissue. Given that there are mollusks that are seasonal breeders, that the neuroendocrine cells controlling reproduction have been identified in several molluskan species, that these neurons are conducive to cell physiological analysis, and that basic features of cell biology have been highly conserved between mammals and mollusks, it seems that the mollusk would provide an excellent model system to investigate cell-physiological events that mediate effects of environmental signals on reproduction. The purpose of this review is to explore this idea in three species in which the topic of the neural basis of seasonal reproduction has been studied: the giant <b>garden</b> <b>slug</b> Limax maximus, the freshwater pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, and the marine snail Aplysia californica...|$|E
40|$|Moraxella osloensis, a gram-negative bacterium, is {{associated}} with Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a nematode parasite of slugs. This bacterium-feeding nematode has potential for the biological control of slugs, especially the grey <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum. Infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita invade the shell cavity of the slug, develop into self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and produce progeny, resulting in host death. However, {{the role of the}} associated bacterium in the pathogenicity of the nematode to the slug is unknown. We discovered that M. osloensis alone is pathogenic to D. reticulatum after injection into the shell cavity or hemocoel of the slug. The bacteria from 60 -h cultures were more pathogenic than the bacteria from 40 -h cultures, as indicated by the higher and more rapid mortality of the slugs injected with the former. Coinjection of penicillin and streptomycin with the 60 -h bacterial culture reduced its pathogenicity to the slug. Further work suggested that the reduction and loss of pathogenicity of the aged infective juveniles of P. hermaphrodita to D. reticulatum result from the loss of M. osloensis from the aged nematodes. Also, axenic J 1 /J 2 nematodes were nonpathogenic after injection into the shell cavity. Therefore, we conclude that the bacterium is the sole killing agent of D. reticulatum in the nematode-bacterium complex and that P. hermaphrodita acts only as a vector to transport the bacterium into the shell cavity of the slug. The identification of the toxic metabolites produced by M. osloensis is being pursued...|$|E
40|$|Slugs {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} animals called Mollusks that {{includes}} clams, oysters, squid, octopus, and snails- slugs closest relative. Snails cause similar damage as slugs, but usually are not as serious a pest in the Pacific Northwest. Outside the garden, slugs and snails actually do good things. They recycle organic matter, which helps to build soils, and {{are an important part of}} the foodchain. Inside the garden and landscape, however, slugs and snails can do considerable damage and often must be controlled. The most common slug species are the Gray <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum, and the European slug, Arion ater. The native Yellow green banana slug, Ariolimax columbianus, is most often found in wooded areas. Slugs vary in length, depending on species and age, from 1 / 4 inch to as much as 10 inches. They move or glide on a “foot”, which produces the slime that helps them move. Their eyes are at the end of stalks, which can be drawn back into their head at the sign of danger. Slugs are active largely at night. They feed during the night and on cool, cloudy days. If the weather is hot and dry, slugs hide beneath stones, flower boxes, boards, and dense plant cover such as ivy. Slugs avoid dry, dusty areas. Slugs have both male and female reproductive systems.

40|$|Moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} associated with Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, a slug-parasitic nematode that has prospects for biological control of mollusk pests, especially the grey <b>garden</b> <b>slug,</b> Deroceras reticulatum. This bacterium-feeding nematode {{acts as a}} vector that transports M. osloensis into the shell cavity of the slug, and the bacterium is the killing agent in the nematode-bacterium complex. We discovered that M. osloensis produces an endotoxin(s), which is tolerant to heat and protease treatments and kills the slug after injection into the shell cavity. Washed or broken cells treated with penicillin and streptomycin from 3 -day M. osloensis cultures were more pathogenic than similar cells from 2 -day M. osloensis cultures. However, heat and protease treatments and 2 days of storage at 22 °C increased the endotoxin activity of the young broken cells but not the endotoxin activity of the young washed cells treated with the antibiotics. This suggests {{that there may be}} a proteinaceous substance(s) that is structurally associated with the endotoxin(s) and masks its toxicity in the young bacterial cells. Moreover, 2 days of storage of the young washed bacterial cells at 22 °C enhanced their endotoxin activity if they were not treated with the antibiotics. Furthermore, purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the 3 -day M. osloensis cultures was toxic to slugs, with an estimated 50 % lethal dose of 48 μg per slug, thus demonstrating that the LPS of M. osloensis is an endotoxin that is active against D. reticulatum. This appears to be the first report of a biological toxin that is active against mollusks...|$|E
