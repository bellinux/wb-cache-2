5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E

On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> At the same time thousands of devotees also jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> After the holy bath, the procession goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians.

5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
