40|$|Gingival {{recession}} is a multifaceted problem, for which several treatment options are available. Both epithelized and subepithelial connective tissue grafts offer predictable {{solutions for the}} treatment of gingival recession. The case report involved a 30 -year-old man with gingival recession of 8 mm on 41 (Miller′s class II recession). Before surgery, <b>full</b> mouth <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> were performed. Recession height, width, probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), and width of the attached gingiva (WAG) were measured at the baseline, two months postoperatively, and six months postoperatively. Four weeks after scaling, the first step of increasing the width of the attached gingiva was carried out, using a free gingival graft. Two months after this step, the subepithelial connective tissue was harvested from the palate and placed in relation to 41, to cover the residual defect. Two months postoperatively, there was a 3 mm gain in WAG and 35 % root coverage. Six months postoperatively there was a significant increase in WAG, CAL; and reduction in height and width of recession (root coverage achieved was 75 %). These results suggested that this two-stage surgical procedure could be successful for root coverage in case of deep recession and lack of attached gingiva in the mandibular anterior region...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To investigate, within general dental practice, patients' and {{vocational}} dental practitioners' (VDP) attitudes towards {{the benefits and}} costs of a simple <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> <b>and</b> to compare the experience of using manual versus ultrasonic instruments to scale teeth. Methods 28 VDPs and 420 patients participated. Patients were randomly allocated to either group. Patients' and VDPs' attitudes towards, and experience of, the <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> were elicited by means of self-administered questionnaires. Results The majority of patients (99 %) believed a <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> was beneficial.

Study {{selection}} Randomised controlled trials (excluding split mouth) {{of routine}} <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatments with <b>and</b> without OHI in healthy dentate adults without severe periodontitis Data extraction and synthesis Study assessment, data extraction {{and risk of}} bias assessment were carried out independently by two reviewers. Mean and standardised mean differences were calculated when different scales were reported. Fixed effects models were used as {{there were only a}} small number of studies. Results Three studies involving a total of 837 patients, and all considered to be at unclear risk of bias were included. No studies reported any adverse effects. Only one trial (conducted in general practice) provided data comparing <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> versus no <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish.</b> It found no evidence to claim or refute benefit for <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatments for the outcomes of gingivitis, calculus and plaque. Two studies, both at unclear risk of bias, compared routine <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> provided at different time intervals. When comparing six with 12 months there was insufficient evidence to determine a difference for gingivitis at 24 months. There were some statistically significant differences in favour of <b>scaling</b> <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> provided at more frequent intervals, in particular between three and 12 months for the outcome of gingivitis at 24 months, with OHI, MD − 0. 14 (95 % CI − 0. 23 to − 0. 05; P value = 0. 003) and without OHI MD − 0. 21 (95 % CI − 0. 30 to − 0. 12; P value < 0. 001) (mean per patient measured on 0 - 3 scale), based on one study. There was some evidence of a reduction in calculus. This body of evidence was assessed as of low quality. One study provided data for the comparison of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatment with <b>and</b> without OHI. There was a reduction in gingivitis for the 12 -month <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatment when assessed at 24 months MD − 0. 14 (95 % CI − 0. 22 to − 0. 06) in favour of including OHI. There were also significant reductions in plaque for both three <b>and</b> 12 -month <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatments when OHI was included. The body of evidence was once again assessed as of low quality. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of routine <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> treatments.

40|$|Background: Practice-based general dental {{practitioners}} routinely provide “scale <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> ” or “oral prophylaxis” to patients attending their practices. Despite its routine provision, {{there is no}} evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of single-visit <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish,</b> nor the frequency at which it should be provided. A recent systematic review recommended that future trials investigating <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> should involve dental practice patients. Methods: A practice-based parallel randomised controlled trial with 24 -month follow-up was conducted. Healthy adults (Basic Periodontal Examination [BPE] codes < 3) were randomly assigned to 3 groups (6 -month, 12 -month, or 24 -month interval between <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish).</b> The primary outcome was gingival bleeding with the hypothesis that 6 -monthly <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> would result in lower prevalence than 12 -month or 24 -month frequency. Follow-up measurements were recorded by examiners blinded to the allocation. 125, 122 and 122 participants were randomised to the 6 -month, 12 -month and 24 -month groups respectively. Complete data set analyses were conducted for 307 participants: 107, 100, and 100 in the 6 -month, 12 -month and 24 -month groups respectively. Chi-square test and ANOVA were used to compare treatment groups at follow-up. Logistic regression and ANCOVA were used to estimate the relationship between outcome and treatment group, adjusted for baseline values.

Methods A practice-based parallel randomised controlled trial with 24 -month follow-up was conducted. Healthy adults (Basic Periodontal Examination [BPE] codes Results Prevalence of gingival bleeding at follow-up was 78. 5 % (6 -month), 78 % (12 -month) and 82 % (24 -month) (p = 0. 746). There were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to follow-up prevalence of plaque and calculus. Statistically significant differences detected in the amount (millimetres) of calculus were too small to be clinically significant. Seventeen (4. 6 %) participants were withdrawn from the trial to receive additional treatment. Conclusions This trial could not identify any differences in outcomes for single-visit <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> provided at 6, 12 and 24 month frequencies for healthy patients (with no significant periodontal disease). However, this is the first trial of <b>scale</b> <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> which has been conducted in a general practice setting and the results are not conclusive.

Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study of students from Federal School of Dental Therapy and Technology Enugu, Nigeria was conducted using self-administered questionnaire to obtain information on demography, self-reported oral health status, knowledge of impact of oral health on daily life activity, dental attendance and perceived dental need. Results: The perception of oral health status and treatment need {{of the two groups}} of dental auxiliaries was the same. Fewer respondents (27. 3 %) rated their oral health as excellent, while 50. 4 % rated their oral health as good. Majority (95. 5 %) agreed that oral health is a part of general health and 94. 6 % agreed that oral health has a role in daily life.
