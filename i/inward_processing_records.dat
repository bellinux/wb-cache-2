Thereby, it distinguishes between size, relative factor endowment, (other) cost factors and infrastructure variables. Using a large panel of bilateral processing trade flows of the EU 12 countries at the aggregate level over the period 1988 – 1999, we find that infrastructure variables, relative factor endowments and other cost variables are important determinants for the EU's outward processing trade. Costs also {{play a key role}} for the EU's <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> trade...|$|R

40|$|With an {{increasing}} international trade, a {{more and more}} significant expansion was experienced by combined commercial operations, also including goods processing transactions. The expansion of these international economic affairs had as motivation the multiple direct and indirect positive effects they produce both at micro and macro level, such as: obtaining a significant commercial profit and on this basis, increasing the currency contribution, increasing the general indicator of the international trade volume, relieving the balance of external payments of certain payments in currency, making optimum use of production capacity and labour force etc. Given {{the complexity of the}} combined commercial operations of foreign trade, in this article we shall address the commercial transactions of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods in terms of accounting models specific for conducting these transactions. In this regard, after the theoretical delimitation of these operations we shall emphasize the benefits of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods but also without forgetting the limitations of these international commercial operations. To develop accounting models we shall first clarify the tax matters that affect the entry in the accounts of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods, then we shall proceed to their reflection in accounting starting from a case study, if the recipient of such operations is based in the extra-community or community area. Thus {{we will be able to}} identify the conditions that the entities must meet in order to use as little cash money, the affecting fiscal conditions and the reflection in accounting of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impacts of an export {{promotion}} policy, namely the <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime, on Turkish trade, employment and competitiveness. Several trade indices as well as descriptive statistics are {{used to assess the}} effects of the regime for the period of 2002 - 2014. It is concluded that its implementation has not been effective more than the average progress in trade flows, employment and competitiveness. There is no clear evidence that Turkish exporters use the regime in order to avoid customs taxes and trade remedies. By reducing the cost of imported inputs with world prices and providing them in a timely manner, the regime places Turkish exporters on an equal footing with others in third countries. In addition, thanks to this regime Turkish businesses, in order to sell good quality products to the world, can reach raw materials, semi-manufactured products or high technology equipment that cannot be provided from the domestic market and that are necessary for an ambitious manufacturing process. Therefore, the application of <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime should be continued as a complementary part of the global supply chain. <b>Inward</b> <b>Processing</b> Regime; Export Incentives; Competitiveness; Competitiveness Indice...|$|R

40|$|Context {{variability}} can {{be defined}} as the number of preexperimental contexts in which a given concept appears. Following M. Steyvers and K. J.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to demonstrate that low context variability confers its memorial advantage because of stronger item-to-list context associations as compared with high context variability. Three experiments that use environmental context changes from study to test demonstrate that the low context variability advantage is eliminated when item-to-list context associations are not available because of environmental changes at test. In addition, the low context variability advantage is eliminated when <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> at study prevents the formation of item-to-list context associations...|$|R

The data was obtained from 26 vegetable oil producer and exporter enterprises by using survey method. Frequency tables, indices, and percentage calculating were used to analyse Data. Also, SWOT analysis was used to determine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the sector, and relationship among some variables were examined with correlation coefficient. According to research findings, 25 of the enterprises (96 %) utilised the IPR. Since the enterprises started to use that system; availability of cheap raw material, rate of capacity utilisation, market share, and export value all have increased. In addition, raw material was found as an important expense item, and the most important problems were qualified as raw material inadequacy and high input prices...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fragmentation and}} globalisation {{in the context}} of the electronics industry in Ireland. Fragmentation refers to the breaking-up of vertically integrated production processes into various components. We find empirical evidence of fragmentation in a number of data sources. Data on <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> trade indicate that production in the Irish electronics industry is globally fragmented, and that the scale of such fragmented production is growing. Furthermore, Ireland’s share of fragmentation is rising faster than that in the EU generally, especially in the electronics industry. Other firm survey data show that the scale of local fragmentation has risen relative to global fragmentation as firms in different Irish intermediate goods producing sectors trade increasingly on the local Irish market. Looking more specifically at the computer manufacturing sector, we find evidence of fragmented production in this sector in that the ratio of bought-in materials to total sales has risen significantly over the past decade.
