5|$|By 1892, Mogadishu {{was under}} the <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar. The Geledi Sultans were {{at the height of}} their power. They {{dominated}} the southern ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland. The Omani Sultans' authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal. When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi. This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not the land itself, which was Somali owned.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway through it to Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging.|$|E
5|$|Nationalism in Soviet Georgia gained {{momentum}} in 1989 with {{the weakening of}} the Soviet Union. The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement. On 11 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, responding to South Ossetia's attempt at secession, abolished the region's autonomy. Georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 April 1991, thus becoming the first non-Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so. A military conflict, which had broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991, lasted until June 1992. The separatists were aided by the former Soviet military units now under Russian command. By June 1992, {{the possibility of a}} full-scale war between Russia and Georgia increased as bombing of Georgian capital Tbilisi in support of South Ossetian separatists was promised by Russian authorities. In order to prevent the escalation between Russia and Georgia, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 24 June 1992. Georgian, South Ossetian, Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the <b>Joint</b> <b>Control</b> Commission's (JCC) mandate. Some, mostly ethnically Georgian parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control. The Tskhinvali-based separatist authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia were in control of one third of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast before the 2008 war.|$|E

25|$|On 25 March 1957, Macmillan acceded to Eisenhower's {{request to}} base 60 Thor IRBMs in England under <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> {{to replace the}} nuclear bombers of the Strategic Air Command, which had been {{stationed}} under <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> since 1948 and were approaching obsolescence. Partly {{as a consequence of}} this favour, in late October 1957 the US McMahon Act was eased to facilitate nuclear co-operation between the two governments, initially with a view to producing cleaner weapons and reducing the need for duplicate testing. The Mutual Defence Agreement followed on 3 July 1958, speeding up British ballistic missile development, notwithstanding unease expressed at the time about the impetus co-operation might give to atomic proliferation by arousing the jealousy of France and other allies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} gain {{switching}} algorithm for <b>joint</b> position <b>control</b> of a hydraulic humanoid robot. Accurate position {{control of the}} lower body is a {{one of the basic}} requirements for robust balance and walking control. In general, it is more difficult to perform <b>joint</b> position <b>control</b> of hydraulic humanoid robots than electric humanoid robots because of a slower actuator time constant and the backdrivability of hydraulic joints. Because of the backdrivability, external forces and torques have a large effect on the position of the joints, and external ground reaction forces prevent a simple PD joint controller from realizing accurate <b>joint</b> position <b>control.</b> We propose a state feedback controller for <b>joint</b> position <b>control</b> of the lower body, define three modes of state feedback gains, and switch the gains effectively according to the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) using linear interpolation. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with a dynamic simulation of a hydraulic humanoid...|$|R

This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.|$|E
