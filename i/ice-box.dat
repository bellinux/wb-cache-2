60|$|Elizabeth's first act, {{when he had}} gone, was {{to fetch}} a banana from the <b>ice-box.</b> Her {{knowledge}} of monkeys was slight, but she fancied they looked with favour on bananas. It was her intention to conciliate Eustace.|$|E
6000|$|And, such is {{the irony}} of fate, next day, when the wreck ahead was cleared, the Swede and I pulled out of Evanston in the <b>ice-boxes</b> of an [...] "orange special," [...] a fast freight laden with fruit from sunny California. Of course, the <b>ice-boxes</b> were empty {{on account of the}} cold weather, but that didn't make them any warmer for us. We entered them through {{hatchways}} {{in the top of the}} car; the boxes were constructed of galvanized iron, and in that biting weather were not pleasant to the touch. We lay there, shivered and shook, and with chattering teeth held a council wherein we decided that we'd stay by the <b>ice-boxes</b> day and night till we got out of the inhospitable plateau region and down into the Mississippi Valley.|$|R
60|$|He gloated on fly-rods and {{gorgeous}} rubber hip-boots, on tents with celluloid windows and folding chairs and <b>ice-boxes.</b> He simple-heartedly {{wanted to buy}} all of them. It was the Paul whom he was always vaguely protecting who kept him from his drunken desires.|$|R
50|$|As the {{new century}} began, {{residential}} growth in the city continued to move eastward, particularly {{with the development of}} the Bayard Park Neighborhood, Washington Avenue and Lincolnshire. Manufacturing also took off, particularly in the automobile and refrigeration industries. Chrysler began making Plymouths on the city's north side, while Seeger, Sunbeam, and Servel made <b>ice-boxes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Kelvinator was a home {{appliance}} manufacturer {{that is now}} a {{brand name}} owned by Electrolux. It {{takes its name from}} William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who developed the concept of absolute zero and for whom the Kelvin temperature scale is named. The name was thought appropriate for a company that manufactured <b>ice-boxes</b> and domestic refrigerators.|$|R
60|$|That was all. There was no discussion. And {{when that}} orange special pulled out, I {{was in the}} <b>ice-boxes.</b> I thought my feet would freeze before morning, and the last twenty miles into Laramie I stood upright in the {{hatchway}} and danced up and down. The snow was too thick for the shacks to see me, and I didn't care if they did.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} quality index method (QIM) scheme for whole <b>ice-boxed</b> {{refrigerated}} blackspot seabream and to perform shelf-life evaluations, using sensory analysis, GR Torrymeter measurements and bacterial counts of specific spoilage organisms (SSO) during chilled storage. A QIM scheme based on a total of 30 demerit points was developed. Sensory, physical and microbiological data were integrated and used to determine the rejection point. Results indicated that the shelf-life of blackspot seabream is around 12 – 13 days...|$|R
60|$|An {{examination}} of the premises showed that all the tableware of value had disappeared, along with two rings which Laura had left on the mantelpiece in the living-room.

60|$|She saw a dozen camping devices {{unknown to}} the East: trailers, which by day bobbed along behind the car like coffins on two wheels, but at night opened into tents with beds, an <b>ice-box,</b> a table; tents {{covering}} a bed whose head rested on the running-board; beds made-up in the car, with the cushions as mattresses.|$|E
5000|$|Gibson {{was founded}} by Joshua Hall in Belding, Michigan, in 1877 as the Belding-Hall Company selling {{cabinets}} that housed blocks of ice (<b>ice-boxes).</b> The area around Belding, Michigan, had a skilled workforce of Danish craftsman and a good supply of hardwoods including ash. The company was purchased by Frank Gibson, a competing manufacturer of [...] "ice refrigerators" [...] in the early 1900s. It was the largest in its industry at the time. In 1932, the company began making electric refrigerators.|$|R

6000|$|Snow was {{beginning}} to fall. A cold night was coming on. After dark I hunted around in the railroad yards until I found an empty refrigerator car. In I climbed--not into the <b>ice-boxes,</b> but into the car itself. I swung the heavy doors shut, and their edges, covered with strips of rubber, sealed the car air-tight. The walls were thick. There was no way for the outside cold to get in. But the inside was just as cold as the outside. How to raise the temperature was the problem. But trust a [...] "profesh" [...] for that. Out of my pockets I dug up three or four newspapers. These I burned, one at a time, {{on the floor of}} the car. The smoke rose to the top. Not a bit of the heat could escape, and, comfortable and warm, I passed a beautiful night. I didn't wake up once.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{got out of}} bed, {{wrapped her}} small body in a pink kimono, thrust her small feet {{into a pair of}} blue slippers, yawned again, and went downstairs. Having taken last night's milk from the <b>ice-box,</b> she went to the back door, and, having filled James's saucer, stood on the grass beside it, {{sniffing}} the morning air.|$|E
60|$|He was {{viewing the}} kitchen upon the {{occasion}} of an intimate Sunday evening supper {{to which he had}} been yearningly invited by Mrs. Gilson. The maids were all out. The Gilsons and Claire, Milt and Jeff Saxton, shoutingly prepared their own supper. While Mrs. Gilson scrambled eggs and made coffee, the others set the table, and brought cold ham and a bowl of salad from the <b>ice-box.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{went to the}} <b>ice-box,</b> and {{produced}} milk and sardines. There was nothing finicky or affected about her guest. He was a good trencherman, {{and he did not}} care who knew it. He concentrated himself on the restoration of his tissues with the purposeful air of one whose last meal is a dim memory. Elizabeth, brooding over him like a Providence, wrinkled her forehead in thought.|$|E
30|$|A {{total number}} of 250 {{groundwater}} samples (shallow and deep bore hand-pumps, India Mark-II) were collected from the study area. 125 samples were collected during pre-monsoon (PRE-M) (May, 2011) and the same number were collected during post-monsoon (POST-M) (November, 2011) season. The groundwater samples were collected from hand-pump after flushing water for 10 – 15  min. The samples were collected in new pre-washed 1 : 1 HDPE bottles with dilute hydrochloric acid and rinsed 3 – 4 times with distilled water and dried before use. The water samples for heavy metal analysis were collected in 500  mL acid washed polyethylene bottles preserved by nitric acid addition at the site (pH <  2). All the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory under low temperature conditions in <b>ice-boxes.</b> The samples were stored in the laboratory at 4  °C until processed/analyzed. For collection, preservation {{and analysis of the}} samples, the standard analytical procedures as recommended by the American Public Health Association (APHA) (2005) were employed.|$|R
40|$|The Perequê and Penedo rivers {{flow through}} the plains of Praia de Leste and fall into the sea between the {{municipalities}} of Pontal do Sul and Ponta do Poço. Both of these rivers belong to the sub-basin of Paranaguá Bay, and are constituent parts of the hydrographic basin of the Atlantic Ocean (State of Paraná). Four sites along the Perequê River (Stations 1 - 4) and one along the Penedo River (Station 5) were monitorated for water pollution over a 12 -month period. During the period of December 1995 to November 1996, three water samples were collected from each site, placed in sterilized bottles and transported to the laboratory in <b>ice-boxes.</b> They were analyzed for the occurrence of total and fecal coliforms, temperature and pH. Fecal pollution was detected throughout the period of study. Coliform contamination was smaller in Station 1 and 5 {{than in any other}} sites, probably due to lesser influence from urbanized areas. Water at Station 4 was strongly contaminated due to its close proximity to a sewage canal. This study demonstrated that the Pequerê and Penedo rivers, freshwater shrimps habitats, were heavily contaminated with fecal indicator bacteria, and this occurrence was not related with temperature or pH...|$|R

When Claire came over to see how they fared, Pinky removed himself, with smirking humility, and firmly joined himself to Jeff and Mr. Boltwood.

60|$|It {{were well}} {{not to forget}} Mrs. McFee. She took a cabin passage on the first steamer going out. She also took with her a theory which she had {{achieved}} in the silent watches of the long dark nights; and it is her conviction that the Northland is unregenerate {{because it is so}} cold there. Fear of hell-fire cannot be bred in an <b>ice-box.</b> This may appear dogmatic, but it is Mrs. McFee's theory.|$|E
60|$|John {{dragged the}} cold mutton from the <b>ice-box,</b> made coffee {{and sat down}} to a lonely meal {{face to face with the}} {{strawberry}} marmalade's shameless certificate of purity. Bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing. His home was dismantled. A quinzied mother-in-law had knocked his lares and penates sky-high. After his solitary meal John sat at a front window.|$|E

60|$|Not till Una {{had promised}} {{that she would}} not summon the doctor was her mother quieted, though Una made the promise with reservations. She {{relieved}} the pain in her mother's side with ice compresses--the ice chipped from the pitiful little cake in their tiny <b>ice-box.</b> She freshened pillows, she smoothed sheets; she made hot broth and bathed her mother's shoulders with tepid water and rubbed her temples with menthol. But the fever increased, and at times Mrs. Golden broke through her shallow slumber with meaningless sentences, like the beginning of delirium.|$|E

They went out to rifle the <b>ice-box.</b> Babbitt gloated, [...] "If your mother caught us at this, we'd certainly get our come-uppance!" [...] and Eunice became maternal, scrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the ear, and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, [...] "It beats the devil why feminists like me still go on nursing these men!" ...|$|E
60|$|George did not struggle. His brain, {{working with}} the cool rapidity of a buzz-saw in an <b>ice-box,</b> had planned a line of action. Few things are more {{difficult}} in this world {{for a young man}} than the securing of an introduction to the right girl under just the right conditions. When he is looking his best he is presented to her {{in the midst of a}} crowd, and is swept away after a rapid hand-shake. When there is no crowd he has toothache, or the sun has just begun to make his nose peel. Thousands of young lives have been saddened in this manner.|$|E
60|$|Two hours later, Scott, {{with a clear}} conscience, laid {{himself down}} to rest on a string cot in a bare room. Two worn bullock-trunks, a leather water-bottle, a tin <b>ice-box,</b> and his pet saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door, and the Club secretary's receipt for last month's bill was under his pillow. His orders came next morning, and with them an {{unofficial}} telegram from Sir James Hawkins, who did not forget good men, bidding him report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south, for the famine was sore in the land, and white men were needed.|$|E

60|$|There {{is indeed}} a {{considerable}} trade in the transplantation of these American jokes to England just now. They generally pine and die in our climate, or they are dead before their arrival; but we cannot be certain that they were never alive. There {{is a sort of}} unending frieze or scroll of decorative designs unrolled ceaselessly before the British public, about a hen-pecked husband, which is indistinguishable to the eye from an actual self-repeating pattern like that of the Greek Key, but which is imported as if it were as precious and irreplaceable as the Elgin Marbles. Advertisement and syndication make mountains out of the most funny little mole-hills; but no doubt the mole-hills are picturesque enough in their own landscape. In any case there is nothing so national as humour; and many things, like many people, can be humorous enough when they are at home. But these American jokes are boomed as solemnly as American religions; and their supporters gravely testify that they are funny, without seeing the fun of it for a moment. This is partly perhaps the spirit of spontaneous institutionalism in American democracy, breaking out in the wrong place. They make humour an institution; and a man will be set to tell an anecdote as if to play the violin. But when the story is told in America it really is amusing; and when these jokes are reprinted in England they are often not even intelligible. With all the stupidity of the millionaire and the monopolist, the enterprising proprietor prints jokes in England which are necessarily unintelligible to nearly every English person; jokes referring to domestic and local conditions quite peculiar to America. I saw one of these narrative caricatures the other day in which the whole of the joke (what there was of it) turned on the astonishment of a housewife at the absurd notion of not having an <b>ice-box.</b> It is perfectly true that nearly every ordinary American housewife possesses an <b>ice-box.</b> An ordinary English housewife would no more expect to possess an <b>ice-box</b> than to possess an iceberg. And it would be about as sensible to tow an iceberg to an English port {{all the way from the}} North Pole, as to trail that one pale and frigid joke to Fleet Street all the way from the New York papers. It is the same with a hundred other advertisements and adaptations. I have already confessed that I took a considerable delight in the dancing illuminations of Broadway--in Broadway. Everything there is suitable to them, the vast interminable thoroughfare, the toppling houses, the dizzy and restless spirit of the whole city. It is a city of dissolving views, and one may almost say a city in everlasting dissolution. But I do not especially admire a burning fragment of Broadway stuck up opposite the old Georgian curve of Regent Street. I would as soon express sympathy with the Republic of Switzerland by erecting a small Alp, with imitation snow, in the middle of St. James's Park.|$|E
6000|$|But we must eat, and {{we decided}} that at the next {{division}} we would throw our feet for grub and make a rush back to our ice-boxes. We arrived {{in the town of}} Green River late in the afternoon, but too early for supper. Before meal-time is the worst time for [...] "battering" [...] back-doors; but we put on our nerve, swung off the side-ladders as the freight pulled into the yards, and made a run for the houses. We were quickly separated; but we had agreed to meet in the ice-boxes. I had bad luck at first; but in the end, with a couple of [...] "hand-outs" [...] poked into my shirt, I chased for the train. It was pulling out and going fast. The particular refrigerator-car in which we were to meet had already gone by, and half a dozen cars down the train from it I swung on to the side-ladders, went up on top hurriedly, and dropped down into an <b>ice-box.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{pink and}} fattish youth {{arrived in the}} red-hot noonday, whimpering a little at fate and famines, which never allowed any one three months' peace. He was Scott's successor--another cog in the machinery, moved forward behind his fellow, whose services, as the {{official}} announcement ran, 'were placed {{at the disposal of}} the Madras Government for famine duty until further orders.' Scott handed over the funds in his charge, showed him the coolest corner in the office, warned him against excess of zeal, and, as twilight fell, departed from the Club in a hired carriage, with his faithful body servant, Faiz Ullah, and a mound of disordered baggage atop, to catch the Southern Mail at the loopholed and bastioned railway-station. The heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face {{as if it had been}} a hot towel, and he reflected that there were at least five nights and four days of travel before him. Faiz Ullah, used to the chances of service, plunged into the crowd on the stone platform, while Scott, a black cheroot between his teeth, waited till his compartment should be set away. A dozen native policemen, with their rifles and bundles, shouldered into the press of Punjabi farmers, Sikh craftsmen, and greasy-locked Afreedee pedlars, escorting with all pomp Martyn's uniform case, water-bottles, <b>ice-box,</b> and bedding-roll. They saw Faiz Ullah's lifted hand, and steered for it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March {{took the}} {{vertebrate}} {{with her to}} the Vienna Coffee-House, where they went to breakfast next morning. She made March buy her the Herald and the World, and she added to its spiny convolutions from them. She read the new advertisements aloud with ardor and with faith to believe that the apartments described in them were every one truthfully represented, and that any one of them was richly responsive to their needs. [...] "Elegant, light, large, single and outside flats" [...] were offered with [...] "all improvements--bath, <b>ice-box,</b> etc."--for twenty-five to thirty dollars a month. The cheapness was amazing. The Wagram, the Esmeralda, the Jacinth, advertised them for forty dollars and sixty dollars, [...] "with steam heat and elevator," [...] rent free till November. Others, attractive from their air of conscientious scruple, announced [...] "first-class flats; good order; reasonable rents." [...] The Helena asked the reader if she had seen the [...] "cabinet finish, hard-wood floors, and frescoed ceilings" [...] of its fifty-dollar flats; the Asteroid affirmed that such apartments, with [...] "six light rooms and bath, porcelain wash-tubs, electric bells, and hall-boy," [...] as it offered for seventy-five dollars were unapproached by competition. There was a sameness in the jargon which tended to confusion. Mrs. March got several flats on her list which promised neither steam heat nor elevators; she forgot herself so far as to include two or three as remote from the down-town region of her choice as Harlem. But after she had rejected these the nondescript vertebrate was still voluminous enough to sustain her buoyant hopes.|$|E
