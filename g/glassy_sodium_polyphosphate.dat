40|$|AbstractQuantum dots of {{cadmium sulfide}} have been {{synthesized}} {{in a series}} of aqueous solutions of two stabilizers: a fixed concentration of polyvinyl alcohol polymer with a variable amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>polyphosphate.</b> Optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements have been performed in order to assess the optical properties of the colloidal solutions.

The results obtained from the spectroscopic techniques reveal two different behaviors as the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is increased in the samples. The photoluminescence of quantum dots in a polyvinyl alcohol solution without <b>sodium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is quenched. The addition of this co-stabilizer activates the luminescence, being more intense and blue-shifted as the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is increased. However, further addition of this product beyond a organic polymer-co-stabilizer weight ratio of 1 : 6. 25 ⋅ 10 − 3 leads to the inverse behavior: a decreasing luminescence intensity and a red shift of the emission peaks are found.

The increasing content of polyphosphate (up to 50 %) in the binary mixture of polyphosphate and orthophosphate or polyphosphate and diphosphate caused the increase of firmness of model samples.

In the current study, the presence of phosphates in the samples of drinking water was determined using a spectrophotometric method with ammonium molybdate.

Methods In each phase, 12 volunteers wore appliances containing 4 enamel specimens, which were {{submitted to a}} 5 -day erosion-remineralization phase that consisted of 2 h of salivary pellicle formation with the appliance in situ, followed by 2 min extra-oral immersion in 1 % citric acid (pH 2. 4), 6 x/day, with 90 min of exposure to saliva in situ between the challenges. Treatment with the test solutions was performed extra-orally for 2 [*]min, 2 x/day. At {{the end of the}} experiment, surface loss (SL, in μm) was evaluated by optical profilometry. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05). The surface of additional specimens was evaluated by x-ray diffraction after treatments (n = 3). Results C (mean SL ± standard-deviation: 5. 97 ± 1. 70) and F (5. 36 ± 1. 59) showed the highest SL, with no significant difference between them (p > 0. 05).
