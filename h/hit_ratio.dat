A total of eleven were launched with five hitting the target. This {{was similar to the}} German <b>hit</b> <b>ratio,</b> and demonstrated the unreliability of the V-2. In 1947, Korolev's group began working on more advanced designs, with improvements in range and throw weight. The R-2 doubled the range of the V-2, and was the first design to utilize a separate warhead. This was followed by the R-3, which had a range of , and thus could target England. The Soviets continued to utilize the expertise of the Germans on V-2 technology for some time; but, to preserve secrecy surrounding the ballistic missile program, Gr√∂ttrup and his team had no access to classified work of their Russian colleagues on new rocket technology including production and testing facilities. This negatively affected the morale of the German team and limited their technical contributions. The Ministry of Defence decided to dissolve the German team in 1950 and repatriated the German engineers and their families between December 1951 and November 1953.|$|E

50|$|Hit rate {{measurements}} are typically performed on benchmark applications. The actual <b>hit</b> <b>ratio</b> varies widely from one application to another.

Even worse, many cache algorithms (in particular, LRU) allow this streaming data to fill the cache, pushing out of the cache information that will be used again soon (cache pollution).|$|E

By exercising cache cooperation between mobile nodes, cooperative caching schemes can improve data accessibility and system performance. Seeing that the cache <b>hit</b> <b>ratios</b> tend to degrade due to high node mobility, restricted battery energy and limited wireless bandwidth in a MANET, we introduce a new cooperative caching scheme, the Regionally Maintained Cooperative Caching (RMCC) scheme, to solve the problem. RMCC allows one node in a region to cache a data item while the other nodes in the same region to cache {{the path to the}} node when to acquire the same item. Such a design helps generate more cache space and wider cached data variety for nodes in one region, and as a result attains higher cache <b>hit</b> <b>ratios</b> as well as lower data access latency. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed RMCC outperforms other schemes in terms of cache <b>hit</b> <b>ratios,</b> in-cache ratios and amounts of required file packets...|$|R

We then use a trace of over seven million queries submitted to the search engine AltaVista to evaluate PDC, as well as traditional LRU and SLRU based caching schemes. The trace driven simulations show that PDC outperforms the other policies. We also examine the prefetching of search results, and demonstrate that prefetching can increase cache <b>hit</b> <b>ratios</b> by 50 % for large caches, and can double the <b>hit</b> <b>ratios</b> of small caches.

Between these two extremes, the cache <b>hit</b> <b>ratios</b> fall more steeply compared to the corresponding scenarios considered for split caches as shown in Figure 12. The rate of performance drops as P 1 is raised from 0.1 to 0.9 is due to limited space on L 1, which is divided up between the two sets of cached content.|$|R

50|$|When {{the cache}} client (a CPU, web browser, {{operating}} system) needs to access data presumed {{to exist in}} the backing store, it first checks the cache. If an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired data, the data in the entry is used instead. This situation is known as a cache hit. So, for example, a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular URL. In this example, the URL is the tag, and the contents of the web page is the data. The percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the hit rate or <b>hit</b> <b>ratio</b> of the cache.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{how to improve}} the performance of file caching by allowing user-level control over file cache replacement decisions.
