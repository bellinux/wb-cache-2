40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that populations exposed to chronic levels of genotoxins for many generations in situ will accumulate latent <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> leading {{to increases in}} mutational load and decreased population fitness. Common pulmonate snails (Lymnaea stagnalis) were collected from three sites that differed in pollution level [Manitoulin Island (reference), Beauharnois (moderate pollution), and Varennes (highly polluted) ]. These organisms have a rapid generation time and are capable of self-fertilization. Fitness indicators were clutch size, survival (hatching to day 30) and growth (length from hatching to day 90). Recessive deleterious mutations that have accumulated through time are masked as snails preferentially outcrossed, but are expressed when snails self-fertilize. Results obtained by comparing fitness components of snails derived from selfing and outcrossing experiments showed that in sites {{with higher levels of}} pollution inbreeding depression increased for clutch size and survival. Results for growth rate were similar to those for clutch size and survival in the two least polluted sites, but not for the most polluted site, due possibly to biased mortality of smaller snails at this site. After correction for size biased mortality, the growth estimates showed patterns similar for the two polluted sites when compared to the reference site. This study suggests that long-term in situ exposure to genotoxic pollution may effect population fitness due to the accumulation of latent <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{objective}} of heritable mutagenesis studies is to evaluate some toxic chemical's potential to induce <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> {{that leads to}} disorders in offspring of test subjects, i. e., transmissible <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> induced in the subjects' germ cells (Maxwell and Newell, 1973; Russell and Kelly, 1982; Shelby, 1988; Shelby, et al., 1993). Typically, laboratory animals are employed as test subjects. For example, in a common design, male (or female) rodents are administered the agent of interest, mated with untreated partners, and their offspring are examined {{to determine whether or}} not chemically-related <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> effects are observed. A number of different assays are available for studying such heritable damage, each of which centers its attention on a different type of genetic toxicity (Russell and Shelby, 1985). These assays include the dominant lethal test (Generoso, 1973; Generoso and Piegorsch, 1993; Green and Springer, 1973), the her...|$|R

A redirection in emphasis from nonanimal systems to relevant animal assays and population monitoring will help to reestablish the credibility of this field. An analysis of the various steps in the carcinogenic process indicates the biological responses occurring during these stages can be utilized for early detection of environmental carcinogens. Emphasis {{should be placed on}} using the earliest significant response that indicates <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> (e. g., gene mutations and chromosome alterations). Assays that detect pregenomic damage (e. g., adduct formation), without evidence of subsequent <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> alterations, may produce misleading results for risk assessment and should not be considered as stand-alone monitoring procedures. Late biological responses may occur in tissues or organs where <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> may be difficult to measure, and the opportunity for intervention diminishes as we approach the clinical outcome. For example, analyzing localized cells that contain activated protooncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressor genes, although they further document adverse response from exposure to carcinogens, may be of greater value for indicating clinical outcome than for genetic monitoring. With few notable exceptions, the window of opportunity for genetic monitoring is the period after exposure where <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> is evident and where circulating lymphocytes can faithfully record this damage. An ongoing study of butadiene-exposed workers illustrates an optimum protocol, where multiple assays can be carried out and correlated with both external and internal measurements of exposure. Population monitoring studies integrating the total effects of multiple chemical exposure are especially suited for monitoring communities near waste disposal sites or industrial plants.

However, few efforts have been made in distinguishing the main pathway of organism <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> by heavy metals related to mining activities. Therefore, we investigated the <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> of Leymus chinensis leaf cells, the air particulate matter (PM) contents, and concentrations of the main heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg) in soil and foliar dust samples collected from seven experiment points at the core mining area and one control point 20 kilometers away from the core mining area in Inner Mongolia in 2013. Comet assay was used to test the <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> of the Leymus chinensis leaf cells; the Tail DNA% and Tail Moment were used to characterize the <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> degree of the plant cells. The comet assay results showed that the cell <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> ratio was up to 77. 0 % in experiment points but was only 35. 0 % in control point. The control point also had the slight Tail DNA% and Tail Moment values than other experiment groups. The cell damage degree of the control group was 0. 935 and experiment groups were 1. 299 - 1. 815. The geo-accumulation index and comperehensive pollution index(CPI) were used to characterize heavy metal pollution in foliar dust samples, and single factor pollution index and CPI were used to characterize the heavy metal pollution in soil samples. The CPIfoliar dust of control group was 0. 36 and experiment groups were 1. 45 - 2. 57; the CPIsoil of control group was 0. 04 and experiment groups were 0. 07 - 0. 12. The results of correlation analyze showed that Air Quality Index (AQI) -CPIfoliar dust(r = 0. 955 **) >Damage degree-CPIfoliar dust(r = 0. 923 **) >Damage degree-AQI(r = 0. 908 **) >Damage degree-CPIsoil (r = 0. 824 *). The present research proved that mining activity had a high level of positive correlation with organism <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> caused by heavy metals through comparing with the control point; soil and atmosphere were both the important action pathway for heavy metal induced <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> in mining area. Furthermore, heavy metal contents in foliar dust showed a higher positive correlation with <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> than when compared with soil. This means the heavy metal contents that L. chinensis absorbed through respiration from the atmosphere could make more serious <b>genetic</b> <b>damage</b> than when absorbed by root systems from soil in the mining area.

40|$|Less than {{a quarter}} of {{reintroduction}} programs have succeeded in re-establishing a self-sustaining population of an extirpated species. Optimal source population selection, based on an evolutionary perspective, could increase the fitness of translocated individuals, thereby improving the success rate of restoring extirpated populations. Here, using three source populations of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar (LaHave River, Sebago Lake, and Lac Saint-Jean), that are being used for reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario, I examined two optimal source population selection approaches: environment matching and adaptive potential. For environment matching, source populations from locations containing similar key environment features as the reintroduction location should contain adaptations to these features. For adaptive potential, source populations with high <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation should have the potential to adapt to new selection pressures, such as the key environment features in the reintroduction location. I tested environment matching using experimental settings by exposing the three source populations to two key environment features that are likely impediments to a successful reintroduction of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario: the presence of non-native salmonids and a high thiaminase diet that can lead to a thiamine (vitamin B 1) deficiency. I also quantified the amount of within-population <b>heritable</b> (additive) <b>genetic</b> variation for early-life history traits to assess the adaptive potential of the source populations. Although the average amount of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation was the highest for early-life history traits of the Sebago population, the amount was low, suggesting that the traits have a limited potential to adapt to any new selection pressures in Lake Ontario. Overall, the Sebago population (a match to both key environment features) had the highest performance, followed by the Saint-Jean population (match to a high thiaminase diet but not non-native salmonids), and finally the LaHave population (not a match to either feature). The pattern of overall performance and the low amount of <b>heritable</b> <b>genetic</b> variation of the three source populations generally supports environment matching over adaptive potential; however, further population comparisons are required over the entire life-cycle and in a fully natural setting to make more robust recommendations for large scale reintroduction efforts of Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario...|$|R
