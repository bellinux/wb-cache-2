40|$|This study {{examines}} growth alterations <b>in</b> liver <b>foci</b> and tumor developmen t {{as a basis}} for the different susceptibility in hepatocarcinogenesi s found among different strains of mice. Male C 57, B 6 C 3 F 1, and C 3 H mice treated with a single dose (1 mg/kg) of N,N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at 15 days of age and followed up to 12 months displayed a strain-dependen t (C 3 H> B 6 C 3 F 1 > C 57) increase in incidence, number, volume fraction, and size of foci and macroscopic lesions (masses). DEN-treated mice exhibited a time-dependent increase <b>in</b> <b>foci</b> size but not <b>in</b> <b>foci</b> number. Phenobarbital (PB) treatment (500 ppm) in the drinking water starting 2 weeks after DEN-initiation did not affect the incidence or number of masses and <b>foci.</b> <b>In</b> all 3 strains, the bromodeoxyuridin e labeling index <b>in</b> <b>foci</b> correlated with foci growth, supporting the major role of cell proliferation <b>in</b> <b>foci</b> growth. Measurements of apoptosis by morphologica l criteria with H&E staining suggest that intrafocal apoptosis may be a late event preventing foci growth and possibly also promoting focal cell selection, whereas extrafocal apoptosis may facilitate clonal growth by removing adjacent normal cells. The onset of conversion of foci to masses also correlated with strain susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|R

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear <b>in</b> <b>focus,</b> visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

50|$|A primary aspect {{in regards}} to the human visual system is blur {{perception}}. It plays a vital role <b>in</b> ocular <b>focusing</b> <b>in</b> order for one to attain clarity central to retinal-imagery.Visual perception is a complex system in which blur perception plays a key role <b>in</b> <b>focusing</b> on near or far objects. Retinal focus patterns are critical in blur perception. These patterns are composed of distal and proximal retinal defocus. Depending on the object’s distance and motion from the individual viewing it, these patterns contain a balance and an imbalance of <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> both directions.|$|R
5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their ancient}} history, all living Andalusians trace {{to a small}} number of horses bred by {{religious}} orders in the 18th and 19thcenturies. An influx of heavy horse blood beginning in the 16th century, resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines; only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian. During the 19th century, the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime, including the War of the Oranges, the Peninsular War and the three Carlist Wars. Napoleon's invading army also stole many horses. One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however, and subsequently used to renew the breed. In 1822, breeders began to add Norman blood into Spanish bloodlines, as well as further infusions of Arabian blood. This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs within the military called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages. In 1832, an epidemic seriously affected Spain's horse population, from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in Cartuja. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European breeders, especially the Germans, changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and Neapolitan horses (an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of chivalry), to an emphasis on the breeding of Thoroughbreds and warmbloods, further depleting the stock of Andalusians. Despite this change <b>in</b> <b>focus,</b> Andalusian breeding slowly recovered, and in 1869, the Seville Horse Fair (originally begun by the Romans), played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses. In the early 20th century, Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds, particularly draft breeds, Arabians, Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds, as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian. The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military, and their numbers decreased significantly.|$|E

40|$|Y-family DNA polymerases {{carry out}} translesion {{synthesis}} past damaged DNA. DNA polymerases (pol) {{and are usually}} uniformly distributed through the nucleus but accumulate <b>in</b> replication <b>foci</b> during S phase. DNA-damaging treatments result {{in an increase in}} S phase cells containing polymerase foci. Using photobleaching techniques, we show that pol is highly mobile in human fibroblasts. Even when localized <b>in</b> replication <b>foci,</b> it is only transiently immobi-lized. Although ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is not required for the localization of pol <b>in</b> <b>foci,</b> it results <b>in</b> an increased residence time <b>in</b> <b>foci.</b> pol is even more mobile than pol, both when uniformly distributed and when localized <b>in</b> <b>foci.</b> Kinetic modeling suggests that both pol and pol diffuse through the cell but that they are transiently immobilized for 150 ms, with a larger proportion of pol than pol immobilized at any time. Treatment of cells with DRAQ 5, which results in temporary opening of the chromatin structure, causes a dramatic immobilization of pol but not pol. Our data are consistent with a model in which the polymerases are transiently probing the DNA/ chromatin. When DNA is exposed at replication forks, the polymerase residence times increase, and this is further facilitated by the ubiquitination of PCNA...|$|R
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model <b>in</b> <b>focus,</b> multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E
