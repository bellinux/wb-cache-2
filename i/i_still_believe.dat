He made his Watford debut a day after joining the club, coming on as a 76th-minute {{substitute}} in a 0–0 draw away at Hull City. Walker also came on as a late substitute in three more games in September 2010, including in Watford's 3–1 victory against his former employers, Middlesbrough.

500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E

500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|After further {{discussion}} and study, he briefly adopted a new date—April 18, 1844—one {{based on the}} Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ's return. In the Advent Herald of April 24, Joshua Himes wrote that all the [...] "expected and published time" [...] had passed and admitted {{that they had been}} [...] "mistaken in the precise time of the termination of the prophetic period". [...] Josiah Litch surmised that the Adventists were probably [...] "only in error relative to the event which marked its close". Miller published a letter [...] "To Second Advent Believers," [...] writing, [...] "I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|While no {{specific}} date {{is given in}} official belief statements, many Adventists hold October 22, 1844 as the starting date for the investigative judgment. Originally Miller set {{the end of the}} 2300 days between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844. In mid-1844, Miller stated [...] "I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment: Yet <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that the day of the Lord is near." [...] In February, 1844, Samuel S. Snow began preaching the end of the 2300 days to be in the Fall of 1844. He soon settled on October 22. In an August camp meeting, October 22 took hold of the Adventists in New England. Miller {{was one of the last}} to accept the date. W. W. Prescott suggested that the investigative judgment occurred in the spring, and not autumn, but his view was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{personally}} set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. [...] However, in response to their urgings, he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the Jewish year beginning in the Gregorian year 1843, stating: [...] "My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844." [...] March 21, 1844, passed without incident, and further discussion and study resulted in the brief adoption of a new date (April 18, 1844) based on the Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ's return.

And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it.

2500|$|During {{the race}} for the seat on the SBOE, the nonprofit {{watchdog}} group Texas Freedom Network (TFN), which first brought Bruner's posts to public attention, warned that the SBOE has a history of mixing culture wars with public education and criticized many of Bruner's public statements immediately prior to her primary election. While some of Bruner's posts were later deleted, TFN and journalists of numerous Texas and national publications made screen shots of the posts and began reporting on them, questioning her fitness to hold public office. When asked about her public statements, Bruner defended them, saying [...] "I don't intend to apologize for my opinions because <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> my statements were accurate." [...] After Bruner's defeat, TPN president Kathy Miller issued a statement saying: [...] "Texas escaped an education train wreck tonight. If Bruner had ultimately won election to the board, she would have instantly become the most embarrassingly uninformed and divisive member on a board that already too often puts politics ahead of making sure our kids get a sound education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foreman {{became ill}} in his {{dressing}} room after the fight. He {{was suffering from}} exhaustion and heatstroke and stated he had a near-death experience. He spoke {{of being in a}} hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and realized {{that he was in the}} midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, [...] "I don't care if this is death – <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> there is a God", he felt a hand pull him out and sensed that he was also suffering stigmata. After this experience, Foreman became a born-again Christian, dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Houston and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center that bears his name. Foreman continues to share his conversion experience on Christian television broadcasts such as The 700 Club and the Trinity Broadcasting Network and later joked that Young had knocked the devil out of him.|$|E

2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and no one seemed to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E
