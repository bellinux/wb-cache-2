40|$|As the {{population}} ages, {{an increasing number}} of vulnerable older people are choosing to live in some sort of home, including sheltered housing, extra care sheltered housing and residential care homes. The needs of older people are constantly changing and there is need for long term support.

Effective sharing of knowledge between supporting housing providers and adult social services can be established through knowledge sharing initiatives.

40|$|In recent years, the {{offshore}} wind industry has experienced significant growth with {{the installation of}} offshore wind farms in shallow water (such as in Denmark). However, almost all of offshore wind turbines to date are mounted on fixed-bottom support structures in water depths of less than 50 m, which are not feasible off the coasts of the United States, China, Japan, Norway and Spain, among others. As a potential solution, wind turbines can be mounted on <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> structures anchored to the seabed through the mooring lines to restrain the global movement of the platform against the effects of wind, waves and currents. Usually, the mooring systems of floaters can be designed such that the system's natural periods fall outside the range of common wave periods. However, due to nonlinearity in the wave to force transformation, oscillating forces can still arise in period ranges that will cause resonance in the structure. In general, the dynamic loads should be studied for the primary components of the wind turbine (blades, drivetrain, nacelle and tower), and also for the mooring systems in <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> structures. One of the main challenges {{is to reduce the}} fatigue of a floating offshore wind turbine so as to guarantee its proper functioning under the constraints imposed by the <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> structures subject to a greater range of motion than that of the fixed-bottom support structures. This paper will analyze the loads and dynamic response of <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> structures together with the mooring systems and will address the structural control issues on the mitigation of the dynamic wind and wave loads on floating wind turbines.

40|$|AbstractSince December 2015, a {{new steel}} bridge spans the Danube River in Bratislava {{in place of}} the Old Bridge which was {{disassembled}} in 2014. A detail design and construction of the bridge is described in the article. The bridge carries trams, pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge has also been designed for future use of tram-trains. It crosses the Danube River with a navigation clearance of 100 m by 10 m and both embankments. The bridge has spans 32. 56 + 106. 68 + 137. 16 + 75. 6 + 75. 92 + 32. 56 m. The superstructure is formed by two steel lattice girders of the total height of 11. 285 m in the distance of 11 m. The rails rests on longitudinal stringers supported by truss cross girders which are overhanging outside the main girders in order to support pedestrians and cycle path as well. The standard deck width of 22. 25 m is enlarged above river piers by observatory platforms to the total width of 33. 25 m. Old piers 2, 5, 6, 7 dated from 1890 have been reconstructed. They are formed by original stone masonry walls with concrete core. Piers 3 and 4 were completely demolished and have been replaced by a new pier 34. The superstructure was incrementally launched into its final position supported by piers and a temporary <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> which was used for the main spans of 106. 68 and 137. 16 m in the Danube River. The movement of the <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> was provided by the launched bridge. An interaction between the bridge and the <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> was taken into account in the analysis and is described in the article. During the launching, both the bridge and the <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> were carefully monitored. A comparison of theoretical assumptions and measured values are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} {{arising from}} the changing demographic profile and the rapid increase in the older population in the UK promotes {{the development of a}} range of models of housing and support that allow elderly individuals to live independently for as long as possible. Over half a million elderly individuals live in rented, sheltered housing in England. Sheltered housing is purpose built accommodation for elderly individuals who want to live independently in an environment that provides support and is secure. It is a common view that knowledge sharing {{plays an important role in}} the success of businesses and organisations. This study proposes to identify the critical success factors (CSF) of knowledge sharing that should improve the provision of <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> services (FSS) to the elderly in sheltered housing. Literature demonstrates that the success of knowledge sharing is influenced by factors including trust, management support, communication, team networking, technology, structure and organisational culture. Knowledge sharing covers a wide variety of functionalities and supports different sets of activities within an organisation. Therefore, to achieve the research aim, both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies are used to gather data. Data have been collected through semi-structured interviews with thirty (30) participants and survey questionnaires engaging ninety (99) respondents across six organisations in Greater Manchester. The findings suggest that trust and relationships, team networking, strong leadership support and information technology are the CSFs that can improve knowledge sharing between <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> workers and adult social service workers; and play an important role in the decision to share knowledge. Based on these findings, a framework for improving knowledge sharing in the provision of FSS was developed. The framework will be of benefit to policy makers and regulators such as housing associations and providers of <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> services. The findings from this research contribute valuable new knowledge to both researchers and practitioners in both housing associations and the adult social service sectors by developing a holistic approach and in turn increasing their chances of improving knowledge sharing between teams providing <b>floating</b> <b>support</b> services...|$|E
