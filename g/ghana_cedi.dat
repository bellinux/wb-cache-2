50|$|The Ghanaian cedi ({{currency}} sign: GH₵; currency code: GHS) is {{the unit}} of currency of Ghana. It is the fourth historical and only current legal tender in the Republic of Ghana. One <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> is divided into one hundred pesewas (Gp).|$|E
50|$|The Big Six {{were six}} {{leaders of the}} United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), the leading {{political}} party in the British colony of the Gold Coast. They were detained by the colonial authorities in 1948 following disturbances leading to the killing of three World War II veterans. They are pictured {{on the front of}} the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> notes.|$|E
50|$|Ghana {{embarked}} on a currency re-denomination exercise, from Cedi (₵) to the new currency, the <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi</b> (GH₵) in July 2007. The transfer rate is 1 <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi</b> for every 10,000 Cedis. Ghana embarked upon an aggressive media campaign {{to educate the public}} about what re-denomination entails. Value added tax is a consumption tax administered in Ghana. The tax regime which started in 1998 had a single rate but since September 2007 entered into a multiple rate regime. In 1998, the rate of tax was 10% and amended in 2000 to 12.5%. The top income tax and corporate tax rates are 25%. Other taxes included with value-added tax (VAT), are national health insurance levy, and a capital gains tax. The overall tax burden amounts to 12.1% of Ghana's total domestic income, and the budget of Ghana has fallen to the equivalent of 39.8% of GDP.Ghana is Africa’s second-biggest gold producer (after South Africa) and second-largest cocoa producer. It is also rich in diamonds, manganese ore, bauxite, and oil. Most of its debt was canceled in 2005, but government spending was later allowed to balloon. Coupled with a plunge in oil prices, this led to an economic crisis that forced the government to negotiate a $920 million extended credit facility from the IMF in April 2015.|$|E
5000|$|After the February 1966 {{military}} coup, the {{new leaders}} wanted {{to remove the}} face of Nkrumah from the banknotes. The [...] "new cedi" [...] (1967-2007) was worth 1.2 cedi which made it equal to half of a pound sterling at its introduction. After decades of high inflation had devalued the new cedi, it was gradually phased out in 2007 {{in favor of the}} [...] "Ghana cedi" [...] at an exchange rate of 1:10,000. In 2007 the largest of the new cedi banknotes, the 20,000 note, had a value of about US$2. By removing four digits, the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> became the highest-denominated currency unit issued in Africa. It has since lost about 75% of its value.|$|E
30|$|The {{demand for}} and {{supply of money}} are the key {{determinants}} of exchange rates. Interest Rate Parity is an important concept that explains the equilibrium state {{of the relationship between}} interest rate and exchange rate of two countries. The foreign exchange market is in equilibrium when deposits of all currencies offer the same expected rate of return. The condition that the expected returns on deposits of any two currencies are equal when measured in the same currency is called the interest parity condition. It implies that potential holders of foreign currency deposits view them all as equally desirable assets, provided their expected rates of return are the same. Given that the expected return on say US dollar deposits is 4 percent greater than that on <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> deposits, all things being equal, no one will be willing to continue holding <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> deposits, and holders of <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> deposits will be trying to sell them for US dollar deposits. There will therefore be an excess supply of <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> deposits and an excess demand for US dollar deposits in the foreign exchange market (Krugman et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Ghana (West Africa) {{underwent}} a currency change in July 2007. This paper explores the {{adaptation to the}} New <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi</b> one year post-redenomination using the theoretical framework of the Money Illusion Effect and the relearning-rescaling hypotheses. Study 1 revealed that {{the old and new}} currencies appeared to be valued similarly, based on the ratings of gains and losses in the old and new currencies. This result is consistent with the slogan of the Ghanaian redenomination public education campaign and suggests that people can be inoculated against the Money Illusion Effect through education. In study 2, attributes of the new currency were rated more positively than those of the old currency, suggesting a preference for the New <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi.</b> Ghana Africa Money Illusion Effect Currency change Adaptation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} two univariate time series models of predicting {{the dynamics of}} the exchange rate (using mid-rate data) of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the US dollar over a 10 year 2 months period from January 2004, to February 2015. We consider out-of-sample forecast {{for the next three years}} of the exchange rate. The time series models considered for this objective are the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Random walk model. We find modest differences between these two models based on the out-of-sample forecast. Interestingly, both models perform similarly based on forecast values. Forecast values shows that the exchange rate of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the American dollar will increase continuously in the next three (3) years...|$|E
40|$|This study modeled {{the monthly}} {{exchange}} rate between the <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi</b> and the US Dollar and forecast future rates using time series analysis. ARIMA model was developed using Box and Jenkins method of Time Series Analysis on the monthly data collected from January, 1994 to December 2010 and validated. The result showed that the predicted rates {{were consistent with the}} depreciating trend of the observed series. ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model was found as the most suitable model with least Normalised Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of 9. 111, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0. 915, Root Mean Square Error of 93. 873 and high value of R- Square of 1. 000. Estimation was done by Ljung-Box test, with (Q 18) = 15. 146, 16 DF and p-value of 0. 514 with no autocorrelation between residuals at different lag times. Finally, a forecast for two-year period from January, 2011 to December, 2012 was calculated which showed a depreciating of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>Cedi</b> against the US Dollar...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{exchange}} rate movement and the nominal interest rate on inflation in Ghana. It also looks at {{the presence of the}} Fisher Effect and the International Fisher Effect scenarios. It makes use of an autoregressive distributed lag model and an unrestricted error correction model. Ordinary Least Squares regression methods were also employed to determine the presence of the Fischer Effect and the International Fisher Effect. The results from the study show that in the short run a percentage point increase in the level of depreciation of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> leads to an increase in the rate of inflation by 0. 20 %. A percentage point increase in the level of nominal interest rates however results in a decrease in inflation by 0. 98 %. Inflation increases by 1. 33 % for every percentage point increase in the nominal interest rate in the long run. An increase in inflation on the other hand increases the nominal interest rate by 0. 51 % which demonstrates the partial Fisher effect. A 1 % increase in the interest rate differential leads to a depreciation of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> by approximately 1 % which indicates the full International Fisher effect...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} investigation {{and application of}} the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve (hybrid NKPC) on Ghanaian economy from 1993 to 2015. The paper seeks to test {{the ability of the}} hybrid NKPC in explaining the inflation dynamics of Ghana. The estimating method used is the Generalized Instrumental Variable Estimator (GIVE). The study begins with a description of the key concepts of the hybrid NKPC, reviews of some relevant evidence of the ability and controversies of the hybrid NKPC as well as the GIVE approach used to estimate the hybrid NKPC. The endogeneous variables used in the study are the broad money supply, the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the US dollar exchange rate, the crude oil price, the actual gross domestic product (GDP). We then used the Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP) to estimate the output gap and also applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to test for stationarity/autocorrelation in all the variables except real GDP. We further estimated the expected future inflation term using broad money supply, the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the US dollar exchange rate and the crude oil price as explanatory while the lagged inflation term was estimated from the actual inflation rates. Afterwards, we applied the GIVE to estimate the hybrid NKPC using the estimated output gap, expected future inflation term and the lagged inflation term. The estimation of the Hybrid NKPC using the Generalized Instrumental Variables Estimator (GIVE) showed that hybrid NKPC fitted the Ghanaian data well. Thus, both the lagged and expected future inflation plays important roles in inflationary pressures in Ghana. The estimated coefficients of approximately 0. 6 and 0. 5 points for lagged inflation and the expected future inflation respectively with the former dominating. However, the study found no effect of growth in gross domestic Product (GDP) or output gap on Ghana’s inflation rates for the period under consideration. In addition, the broad money supply, the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the US dollar exchange rate and crude oil price were found to be the driving forces for expected future inflation rate and therefore indirectly affects inflation rate of today. The study recommends that to maintain low and steady inflation, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) in collaboration with policymakers as well as governments policies should gear towards controlling lagged and expected inflation first...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonality}} of Ghanaian {{economic activities}} such as agriculture, consumption, money supply among others which affect exchange rate gives the impression that, the Cedi – US Dollar rate also follows a particular pattern within the year. Using quarterly interbank Exchange rate data from 2000 to 2014, sourced from Bank of Ghana,this study has established the quarterly behaviour of the Cedi against the US Dollar. To achieve this, both statistical analysis and econometric model including trend, F – Test, K – Test and regression were computed {{with the aid of}} X- 12 Census ARIMA program provided by the US Census Bureau. Whiles the trend analysis suggest seasonal depreciation of the Cedi with peak in the fourth quarter, the regression results indicates statistically insignificant average mean difference between the quarters. However, the moving seasonality test showed a cyclical pattern of seasonal frequencies evolving from year to year. The general conclusion we established from the study is that depreciation of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> to the dollar follows a moving seasonality with a pattern constantly repeated year to yea...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{macroeconomic}} determinants of interest rate spreads in Ghana for the period 1980 - 2013. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive distributed lag bounds test approach to cointegration and the error correction model were used for the estimation. Findings: The results indicate that exchange rate volatility, fiscal deficit, economic growth, and public sector borrowing from commercial banks, increase interest rate spreads in Ghana in both the long and short run. Institutional quality reduces interest rate spreads in the long run while lending interest rate volatility and monetary policy rate reduce interest rate spreads in the short run. Research limitations/implications: The depreciation of the <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> must be controlled since its volatility increases spreads. There is a need for fiscal discipline since fiscal deficits increase interest rate spreads. Government must reduce its domestic borrowing because the associated crowding-out effect increases interest rate spreads. The central bank must improve its monitoring and regulation of the financial sector in order to reduce spreads. Originality/value: The main novelty of the paper (compared to other studies on Ghana) lies on the one hand; analysing macroeconomic determinants of interest rate spreads and, on the other hand, controlling for the impact of institutional quality on interest rate spreads in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|All-male tilapia {{production}} is an emerging market in Ghana {{and a potential}} source of employment for the people. Despite the increase in livestock and poultry industries, the problem of protein deficiency continues unabated. The contribution of the fishing industry to solving the protein deficiency problem is important. Using data from eighty randomly sampled fish farmers in the Ashanti Region, the profitability of all-male tilapia farming was assessed and the determinants of all-male tilapia output examined. Gross margin analysis and production functions were estimated. Comparing costs and returns, a gross margin of GH ¢ 5, 797. 56 and profit of GH ¢ 2, 282. 17 were realized per annum. The {{rate of return on}} investment of 1. 86 implies that for each <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> invested in this enterprise, a return of GH ¢ 1. 86 was obtained. Regression analysis revealed that all-male tilapia output was significantly determined by feeding, cost of fingerlings, pond size, sex and experience in fish farming. It is concluded that all-male tilapia {{production is}} economically rewarding and capable of creating employment, augmenting income and improving living standards of people. Government participation in all-male tilapia farming can boost the quantity of fish available for consumption in the country. Key words: all-male tilapia, gross margin analysis, cost of fingerlings, production function and pond siz...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the financial cost of managing diabetes mellitus in four Cocoa clinics of Ghana. MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study of diabetes management {{was carried out}} in the four Cocoa clinics of Ghana from January to December 2009. The “cost-of-illness” approach from the institutional perspective was used. A pretested data extraction form was used to review the medical records of 304 randomly selected diabetic patients. ResultsThe patients’ mean age was 55. 4 ± 9. 4 years. The mean annual financial cost of managing one diabetic case at the clinics was estimated to be <b>Ghana</b> <b>cedi</b> (GHS) 540. 35 (US $ 372. 65). Service cost constituted 22 % of the cost, whereas direct medical cost constituted 78 % of the cost. Drug cost was 71 % of the financial cost. The cost of hospitalization per patient-day at Cocoa clinics was estimated at GHS 32. 78 (US $ 22. 61). The total financial cost of diabetes management was estimated at GHS 420, 087. 67 (US $ 289, 715. 63). This accounted for 8 % of the total expenditure for the clinics in the year 2009. The study showed that facility type, type of diabetes, and presence of complication are associated with the cost of diabetes management to Cocoa clinics. ConclusionsThe mean age of detection suggests delay in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and accompanying complications, which has cost implications. Policy that enhances early detection of diabetes in clinical practice would therefore improve management and reduce costs. The financial cost of managing diabetes can be used to forecast the economic burden of the disease in the area...|$|E
