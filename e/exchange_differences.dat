40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{volatility}} transmissions between portfolios of cross-listed equities and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> and also the volatility persistence for home, foreign equities, and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> in the UK and German markets. Design/methodology/approach – A primary focus of this paper is to see if there is an impact first on the volatility persistence for foreign equities that are listed in the UK and German markets, second on the respective home portfolios of cross-listed equities, and third on the <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences.</b> In addition, whether there are any bilateral spillovers between the following equity portfolios: foreign cross-listed equities, home cross-listed equities, and also local or global <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> are investigated. Findings – The paper finds that the volatility persistence is more prominent than error persistence from cross-listed equities, foreign or home, and the <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences.</b> Furthermore, the transmission mechanism indicates a bilateral integration process in some of the cases that were examined. Based on these results, it is concluded that in the UK market the foreign cross-listings affect less the domestic equities compared to the German market. Originality/value – This paper examines the interdependence of portfolios of home and foreign equities for cross-listings that belong to the same stock exchange with two exchange rates, a local and a global one in order to provide more evidence in this area of literature.

The company was in full international expansion at that time.

50|$|The {{operation}} {{of the law of}} value in the world market might however seem rather abstract, in view of the phenomena of unequal <b>exchange,</b> <b>differences</b> in accounting norms, protectionism, debt-driven capital accumulation and gigantic differences in currency exchange rates between rich and poor countries. These phenomena can create very a significant distortion in world trade between final market prices for goods, and the real production costs for those goods, resulting in superprofit for the beneficiaries of the trade. The value and physical volume of manufactured exports by developing countries increased gigantically more than the actual income obtained by the producers. Third world nations relatively speaking received less and less for what they produced for sale in the world market, even as they produced more and more; this is also reflected in the international terms of trade for manufactured products.|$|E

Result of the model concluded that there is a light to medium tendency to distortion of the main financial indicators produced by the change in the tax treatment of the exchange difference.
