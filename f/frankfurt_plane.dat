It was placed roughly at the intersection of the <b>Frankfurt’s</b> <b>plane</b> and the midline of the right mastoid. The right posterior parietal of the deceased also exhibited a callus-like formation consistent with the linear cranial fracture. Our aim was to investigate by computed tomography (CT) a possible presence of otopathology – a chronic middle ear infection – MEI/mastoiditis or cholesteatoma. On the other hand, both standard radiography and CT were employed in a cranial fracture diagnostic agreement. The generated CT scans confi rmed the presence of an artifi cial hole running into a well defi ned trepanne canal connected with the antrum. The presence of otopathology was not established. The radiography and CT substantiated the presence of a linear posterior parietal discontinuity – without displacement, in front of the right lambdoid suture. From the medical point of view, it would be unusual to perform infratentorial – mastoid trepanation for reasons of treating supratentorial trauma, i. e. possible posttraumatic acute subdural hematoma (PTASDH). However, since {{there was a lack of}} CT evidence of osteolysis in ME, there is a possibility of medieval trepanation procedure performed for reasons of posttraumatic treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An anthropological {{characterization}} of the sizes of the so-called „cheek-bone triangle “ (Porion-Orbitale-Zygomaxillare-Porion) has been made. This renders the possibility of determining the slant angle of the cheek-bone (the so-called „vertical profiling“) and the registration of the skull facial part plane as a racial-diagnostic feature. KEY WORDS. skull, os zygomaticum (cheek-bone), anthropometry. The cheek-bone occupies the upper lateral part of the skull facial portion in man. It serves {{to a great extent}} as a link between the face part and the brain one of the skull – a link to the frontal, sphenoidal and temporal bones. The location of the zygomatic bone against the frontal and sagital planes determine the horizontal profiling of the face and its width sizes as well. In studies on the appearances and degree of asymmetry in the facial part of the skull it was established that they are most pronounced in the mid-face portion, i. e. in the morphological structure maxilla-os zygomaticum (1, 2). The tilt of the cheek-bone against the <b>Frankfurt</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> is one of the racial-diagnostic features in the anthropological {{characterization of}} the individual (7, 4). M. Gerasimov (5) has defined it as „vertical profiling “ degree of flatness of the skull facial part. As a typical trait of the Mongoloid race he has established the values of the angle which the cheek-bone forms with the horizontal plane (around 90 o), the so-called vertical shape of the cheek-bone. According to M. Gerasimov (6) the angle of the cheek-bone tilt in Europeans is 50 o and is even smaller. As a rule, the profiling of the cheek bones in Mongoloids is not smaller than 65 o, most often nearing 70 o and in certain series even exceeding 80 o.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} sagittal condylar guidance obtained by protrusive interocclusal records and panoramic radiograph tracing methods in human dentulous subjects. Materials and Methods: The sagittal condylar guidance was determined in 75 dentulous subjects by protrusive interocclusal records using Aluwax through a face bow transfer (HANAU™ Spring Bow, Whip Mix Corporation, USA) to a semi-adjustable articulator (HANAU™ Wide-Vue Articulator, Whip Mix Corporation, USA). In the same subjects, the sagittal outline of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the heights of curvature in the glenoid fossa and the corresponding articular eminence. This was then related to the constructed <b>Frankfurt′s</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> to determine the radiographic angle of sagittal condylar guidance. Results: A strong positive correlation existed between right and left condylar guidance by the protrusive interocclusal method (P 0. 000) and similarly by the radiographic method (P 0. 013). The mean difference between the condylar guidance obtained using both methods were 1. 97 ° for the right side and 3. 18 ° for the left side. This difference between the values by the two methods {{was found to be}} highly significant for the right (P 0. 003) and left side (P 0. 000), respectively.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{negative}} impact of illumination on face recognition, we propose a new illumination compensation method based on image invariant calculation. This invariant (the sum of compensating angles, SCA) is calculated by summing two lighting angles in the proper-compensated state. The SCA only depends on single light source and can be computed only once for a lighting system. Based on the <b>Frankfurt</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> of a human skull, we propose a geometric face model of human skull structure. According to our face model, the compensating angle is calculated from the SCA for a face image taken in the same lighting system.

In the current study information about normal sex-related dimensions of the orbital region, and growth, development and aging, were provided. The three-dimensional coordinates of several soft-tissue landmarks on the orbits and face were obtained by a non-invasive, computerized electromagnetic digitizer in 531 male and 357 female healthy subjects aged 4 - 73 years. From the landmarks, biocular and intercanthal widths, paired height and inclination of the orbit relative to both the true horizontal (head in natural head position) and <b>Frankfurt</b> <b>plane,</b> length and inclination of the eye fissure, the relevant ratios, soft-tissue orbital area, were calculated, and averaged for age and sex. Comparisons were performed by factorial analysis of variance. Biocular and intercanthal widths, length of the eye fissure, soft-tissue orbital area, and the inclination of the orbit relative to the true horizontal, were significantly larger in men than in women (p < 0. 01), with a significant effect of age (p < 0. 001), and significant age × sex interactions (p < 0. 001). Orbital height, and the height-to-width ratio increased as a function of age (p < 0. 001), but without gender-related differences. The inclination of the orbit relative to <b>Frankfurt</b> <b>plane,</b> and the inclination of the eye fissure did not differ between men and women, but modified as a function of age (p < 0. 001), with different sex-related patterns (sex × age interaction, p < 0. 001). On average, the paired measurements were symmetric, with similar values within each sex and age group. Overall, when compared to literature data, some differences were found due to both ethnicity, and different instruments. Nevertheless, during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, the age-related trends for linear dimensions were similar to those found in previous studies, while no previous data exist for older adults. During aging an increment in soft-tissue orbital area was found, with a progressive downward shift of landmark orbitale. Data collected in the present investigation could serve as a data base for the quantitative description of human orbital morphology during normal growth, development and aging. Forensic applications (evaluations of traumas, craniofacial alterations, teratogenic-induced conditions, facial reconstruction, aging of living and dead persons, personal identification) may also benefit from age- and sex-based data banks. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of the <b>Frankfurt</b> <b>plane</b> (FP) and mid-sagittal plane (MSP) of a human skull {{is a very important}} task. These planes are used to define important landmarks on the skull for surgery planning and guidance, forensic reconstruction, and anthropological and archaeological studies. At present, there is no known method for automatic {{identification of}} FP. Existing methods identify FP by fitting a plane over manually marked landmark points. On the other hand, existing automatic methods identify MSP by looking for a symmetric plane that divides the skull into the left and right sides. Unfortunately, this approach is inaccurate because extensive anthropological studies show that there is significant lateral asymmetry in the skulls. This paper proposes an automatic, accurate, and robust method for identifying FP and MSP of skulls. It registers a template skull model with known landmarks to a target skull to locate the landmarks, FP, and MSP on the target skull. Then, it iteratively refines the landmark locations, FP and MSP according to their medical definitions.

Many methods have been suggested in an attempt to establish the best way to evaluate the position of the head using teleradiographs and cephalometric analysis. However, there is still no agreement as to which procedure is the best. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences that exist between craniocervical measurements in lateral teleradiographs when comparing the position of the head in the self-balanced position to the position of the head using the Frankfurt method (<b>Frankfurt</b> <b>plane</b> parallel to the floor).

Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between the oral and nasal breathers, respectively: lower facial height (49. 1 / 45. 9 mm), <b>Frankfurt</b> - mandibular <b>plane</b> angle (30. 1 / 26. 9 º) and Sela-Nasion - oclusal plane angle (17. 3 / 15 º), maxillary length (78. 4 / 82. 4 mm), mandibular length (102. 4 / 107 mm), overbite (0. 8 / 3. 1 mm) and overjet (4 / 4. 7 mm). Discussion: Comparison between the allergic rhinitis and control group showed that there is an increased lower facial height, larger <b>Frankfurt</b> - mandibular <b>plane</b> angle and Sela-Nasion oclusal plane angle in children with chronic allergic rhinitis. This group also had a shorter maxillary and mandibular length, less overbite and decreased upper airway space. Conclusions: Children with allergic rhinitis and mouth breathing have longer faces, shorter maxillas and mandibles and a narrowed pharyngeal airway space. No statistical differences between the groups in sagital relationships or in dental inclinations were found...|$|R
3000|$|The present {{research}} was conducted in the Department of Forensic and State Medicine of Burdwan Medical College, Burdwan, West Bengal, India. The bones were collected from {{the archives of the}} departmental museums of two medical colleges of eastern India. The skulls belonged to the population of the province of West Bengal, a populated region of eastern India with primarily Indo-Aryan race among others. The morphometric study was done on 92 skulls (61 males and 31 females). The skulls were dry and fully ossified. None of the skulls had any injury, congenital deformity or artefacts. The orbits were measured twice in two different days by a single researcher after putting the skull in <b>Frankfurt’s</b> horizontal <b>plane.</b> The orbital height and breadth was measured by digital vernier calliper up to the nearest millimetre (mm).To test for inter-observer agreement rating of the method, 20 randomly chosen bones were measured by two observers and the results were tested by Cohen's kappa statistics. For intra-observer reliability, the two set of measurements were compared by paired t test wherein no significant difference was found in the mean values. The data was analysed using the SPSS version 19.0 computer software for descriptive and inferential statistics. Computing of descriptive statistics was followed by discriminant function analysis (DFA). A p value of less than [...]. 05 was used for statistical significance [...]...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: Occlusion is an {{important}} component of temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Little is known about the association between missing teeth and TMJ changes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a correlation exists between unilateral missing posterior teeth and changes in the inclination of the articular eminence (AE). Materials and methods: A total of 106 joints in 53 patients (20 men and 33 women) with unilateral posterior edentulism were included. In the same patients, the sagittal outline of the AE and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the crest of the glenoid fossa and the crest of AE. This was then related to the constructed <b>Frankfurt's</b> horizontal <b>plane</b> to determine the inclination of AE. The results were subjected to the one-way analysis of variance test. A P value of   0. 05). The inclination of AE in men was higher than in women on both the missing side and the nonmissing side (P >  0. 05). The symmetry equality between the missing and the nonmissing side joint was 1. 89 %. This value was higher (3 %) in the female group than in the male group (0 %). Comparing the absolute mean differences, the female group showed a lower difference (9. 8 °) than the male group (12. 11 °). Conclusion: A wide range of values of AE inclination was found regardless of other factors such as side of teeth loss and the sex of patients...|$|R
