It was illustrated by Frederick Richardson, who had also illustrated Baum's Queen Zixi of Ix. The story deals with Santa Claus's kidnapping by the Daemons of the caves, {{in an effort to}} thwart his yearly delivery of toys. However, Claus's assistants complete the task for him, and later attempt an unnecessary rescue.|$|E
25|$|Bogart's father, Belmont, was a {{cardiopulmonary}} surgeon. His mother, Maud, was {{a commercial}} illustrator who received her art training in New York and France, including study with James McNeill Whistler. Later she became art {{director of the}} fashion magazine The <b>Delineator</b> and a militant suffragette. She used a drawing of baby Humphrey in a well-known advertising campaign for Mellins Baby Food. In her prime, she made over $50,000 a year, then a vast sum and far more than her husband's $20,000. The Bogarts lived in a fashionable Upper West Side apartment, and had an elegant cottage on a 55-acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in upstate New York. As a youngster, Humphrey's gang of friends at the lake would put on theatricals.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Delineators</b> are tall pylons (similar {{to traffic}} cones or bollards) {{mounted on the}} road surface, or {{along the edge of}} a road, and are used to {{channelize}} traffic. These are a form of raised pavement marker but unlike most such markers, <b>delineators</b> are not supposed to be hit except by out-of-control or drifting vehicles. Unlike their smaller cousins, <b>delineators</b> are tall enough to impact not only a vehicle's tires but the vehicle body itself. They usually contain one or more retroreflective strips. They can be round and open in the center or curved (45-degree sections) of plastic with a reflective strip. They are also used in low reflective markers in a [...] "T" [...] shape. They {{can also be used to}} indicate lane closures as in cases where the number of lanes is reduced.|$|R
500|$|Another key {{influence}} was Hugh Ferriss, {{one of the}} designers for the 1939 World’s Fair who designed bridges and huge housing complexes. He was an American <b>delineator</b> (one who creates perspective drawings of buildings) and architect. In 1922, skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett commissioned [...] to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the 1916 Zoning Resolution. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book The Metropolis of Tomorrow (Dover Publications, 2005, [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, with a new {{cohesion}} {{in social}} groups based on economic choices, the beginnings of consumer culture brought Champagne to the fore as a <b>delineator</b> of class and status, becoming what {{has been described as a}} [...] "centrepiece of bourgeois society". This came about in part by the usual, informal pursuit of traditional practices and social norms. However, there was a great deal of careful and deliberate generation of rituals and images surrounding Champagne, not by any one agency or department, but as a result of widespread commercial efforts to market and popularise its consumption.|$|E

[...] The Times called the play [...] "an excellent vehicle for Mr. Beban, who has long been regarded as a clever <b>delineator</b> of Italian roles." [...] The reviewer said of Beban's performance: [...] "Here he portrays very beautifully the simplicity, gentleness, sweetness, and, when occasion arises, the native ferocity of the ignorant but wellmeaning foreigner, who is conscious of the obstacles which he confronts {{on account of his}} poverty, and the contempt and suspicion under which he labors because of the crimes of evildoers of his own nationality." ...|$|E
40|$|Vertical <b>delineators</b> are {{intended}} to warn drivers of an approaching curve while providing them with a better appreciation of the sharpness of a curve. Drivers can then select an appropriate speed before entering the curve. Delineation can also provide continuous tracking information once drivers are within the curve to help position their vehicles within the travel lane while traversing the curve. The {{most common type of}} vertical delineation is post mounted <b>delineators</b> (PMDs). These devices are usually flexible or rigid posts with some amount of reflective surface mounted along the roadside to provide additional delineation. Another treatment that has been used is to provide additional delineation on chevron posts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an individual identification system using single lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The pro-posed techniques for P and T wave delineation {{are based on}} time derivative and adaptive thresholding. The performance of proposed <b>delineators</b> is evaluated on manually annotated Phy-sionet QT database. The accuracy of <b>delineators</b> are quantified on mean error and standard deviation of differences between manually annotations and automated results. Especially, lower values of error in standard deviation for onset and offset of P wave fiducials are obtained as 8. 1 and 6. 29 while for T wave fiducials are 9. 4 and 11. 2 (where units are in ms). It shows the performance of P and T wave <b>delineators</b> is optimum and also stable in comparison to other published results. Found fiducials are processed for the extraction of heartbeat features. From each heartbeat, 19 stable features related to interval, amplitude and angle are computed. The feasibility of ECG as a new biometric is tested on proposed identification system designed on template matching and adaptive thresholding. The accuracy of identification system is achieved to 99 % on the datasize of 125 recordings prepared from 25 individual ECG of Physionet. I...|$|R

60|$|The {{party had}} the {{privilege}} of idling through this ancient quarter of New Orleans with the South's finest literary genius, the author of 'the Grandissimes.' In him the South has found a masterly <b>delineator</b> of its interior life and its history.

5000|$|The third bore {{also brought}} new {{technology}} to the tunnel with {{the installation of the}} [...] "pop-up" [...] lane control. Plastic lane <b>delineators</b> were set in tubes within the pavement. With the touch of a button, water would fill tubes to cause the <b>delineators</b> to pop up from the pavement; the middle bore was closed to one direction of travel, while opening it to another. During the week, the middle bore of the Caldecott was reversed between 2:00 am and 5:00 am to favor westbound traffic, and then switched again sometime between 11:30 am and noon to favor eastbound traffic. Ballgames, concerts and other events made balancing weekend traffic through the tunnel very difficult. It was not uncommon to reverse the middle bore six times on a Saturday or Sunday.|$|R
50|$|The pop-up system still {{required}} {{a lot of}} manpower to implement. While it did eliminate the need to set down individual cones to separate traffic, Caltrans maintenance workers had to direct traffic out of the closing lanes to prevent vehicles from getting caught {{on the wrong side}} of the pop-up <b>delineators.</b>|$|R

50|$|Once the Grace Bridge {{was posted}} with a load limit {{and could not}} carry large trucks, the {{reversible}} lane was made southbound permanently. This made sure that trucks had access across the Cooper River at all times. Unfortunately, this also meant that there was always oncoming traffic on the Pearman Bridge. Fatal head-on collisions on the Pearman Bridge led to a debate about constructing a barrier to separate traffic. The debate was resolved when the transportation department installed plastic <b>delineators</b> on the bridge during its final years.|$|R
50|$|For {{each of his}} designs, Ellis made a {{so-called}} show drawing, usually a technically dazzling pen-and-ink perspective rendering, which Buffington and other employers submitted to the weekly American Architect and Building News and, sometimes, the monthly Inland Architect. Since few of these designs were built, fewer still stand today, and many of Ellis's original renderings have disappeared, the published renderings provide a trail of his evolution as a designer. Because his beautiful renderings appeared in widely disseminated magazines, Ellis quickly {{became one of the}} most influential perspective renderers in the country, and both his architectural and drawing mannerisms were soon imitated by dozens of other architects and <b>delineators.</b> Some of their work was signed, some was not, and decades later some of it was mistakenly attributed to Ellis. The concept that Ellis deliberately shunned professional acclaim by producing anonymous or pseudonymous work allowed such attributions. Separating the work of other <b>delineators</b> from that of Ellis is facilitated by the sometimes overlooked fact that, with but very few exceptions, Ellis signed his renderings just as he signed his paintings. Connoisseurship also helps. Ellis was proud of his achievements and with his signature claimed his rightful place in the world of architecture and painting.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to make observations of form in Christian Lauba's Dream in a Bar for baritone saxophone and percussion through an analysis of pitch, rhythmic and timbral organisation. It will be shown that Dream in a Bar is a single movement work that is essentially through-composed and {{does not have any}} large scale musical return, such as one would see in sonata form. Subsequently, this dissertation will explore other relationships by which to establish the form of the work. It will consider the large-scale functions of pitch, rhythm and timbre as organising elements. Following an outline of concepts pertaining to twentieth century musical form within the western art music tradition, the analysis will consider Lauba's use of pitch, rhythm and timbre as individual <b>delineators</b> of form in Dream in a Bar. The conclusion and discussion will present the findings of the analysis. This dissertation will examine the large-scale functions of pitch, rhythm and timbre in Dream in a Bar as <b>delineators</b> of form, rather than discussing specific small-scale events. The structure of a piece of music is perceived, not as a series of discreet independent units strung together, but as a process wherein smaller ideas function {{as part of a larger}} organisation (Cooper & Meyer, 1960, 2) ...|$|R
