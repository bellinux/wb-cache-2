50|$|Materials:Obtain {{a sample}} of mixed liquor. Transfer the sample into a {{laboratory}} in order to analyze it. Measure the volume weight of the sample. Remove two filter papers from a desiccator and record the weight of each. Place the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> on a vacuum flask and then place another filter {{on top of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> by using a pair of tweezers. Stir the sample of mixed liquor {{in order to get a}} good mixture for the experiment. After sample is mixed, pour 5 mL into a graduated cylinder. Turn on the vacuum pump and pour the sample into the <b>filter</b> <b>holder.</b> After all the mixed liquor has gone through, run three portions of 10 mL distilled water through the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> to rinse any particles that may have stuck to the glass. Allow the vacuum pump to run an additional three minutes. This will help remove any extra water from the filter before drying. Switch the vacuum pump off and remove the filter from the <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> and place in the corresponding weighing dish. Repeat above process for as many trials as needed. Place the filter(s) into a drying oven, which is set to 103°-105° C, for one hour. Upon drying, replace filters into a desiccator for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes in the desiccator, the filters are to be weighed.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a small {{personal}} aerosol sampler for measuring occupational exposure to airborne particles in the breathing zone. Existing aerosol samplers are too large to be mounted inside modern welder’s protective equipment without disturbing the worker. A headset-mounted mini sampler has been developed to fill this gap with focus on manganese exposure. This mini sampler is easy to use and can be mounted inside modern, slimline welder’s face shield. The mini sampler is based on a commercially available 13 -mm <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> that has been modified to incorporate an inlet nozzle made of aluminium. The nominal flow rate of the mini sampler is 0. 75 l min 21. The mini sampler is to be worn mounted on a headset, modified from professional microphone headsets.

40|$|Abstract Background Epifluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a common}} method used to enumerate virus-like particles (VLP) from environmental samples and relies {{on the use of}} filter membranes with pore sizes Results Here we describe a modified protocol for 13 mm Anodisc membranes that uses a custom <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> that can be readily constructed in individual investigators' laboratories from commercially available Swinnex ® <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> We compared VLP concentrations obtained from phage lysates and seawater samples using both Anodisc membranes, as well as Nuclepore™ small pore-size membranes (0. 015 or 0. 030 μm). The 13 mm Anodisc membranes gave comparable estimates of VLP abundance to those obtained with the 25 mm Anodisc membranes when similar staining methods were employed. Both Nuclepore membranes typically gave an order of magnitude lower VLP abundance values for environmental samples. Conclusions The 13 mm Anodisc membranes are less costly and require smaller sample volumes than their 25 mm counterpart making them ideal for large-scale studies and sample replication. This method increases the options of reliable approaches available for quantifying VLP from environmental samples. </p...|$|R

Beam-splitting is obtained with standard dichroic filters mounted at 45 °; they are located in a two-place <b>filter</b> <b>holder.</b> For a dichroic filter of 570  nm, excitation may be carried out until about 560  nm and emission collected after about 580  nm (“excite bellow, collect above”). The optimization of the signal was performed daily for all pinhole apertures through mirror alignment, following the manufacturer’s instructions, using a rhodamine standard (or other adequate reference). For the study of red dyes, two <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> with two sets of dichroic filters are employed, 500 and 570  nm in one set and 525 and 600  nm in the other set. This enables both the emission and excitation spectra to be collected with the same <b>filter</b> <b>holder.</b> A continuous 450  W xenon lamp, providing an intense broad spectrum from the UV to near-IR, is directed into a double-grating monochromator, and spectra are collected after focusing on the sample (eye view) followed by signal intensity optimization (detector reading). The pinhole aperture that controls the area of analysis is selected based on the signal-to-noise ratio. For weak to medium emitters, it is set to 8  μm, in this work for very weak signals 30  μm spot was also used (pinholes 5 and 8, respectively) with the following slits set:emission slits[*]=[*] 3 / 3 / 3  mm and excitation slits[*]=[*] 5 / 3 / 0.8  mm.

40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>holders</b> and {{continuous}} air monitors (CAMs) are used {{extensively in the}} nuclear industry. It is important to minimize leakage in these devices and in recognition of this consideration, a limit on leakage for sampling systems is specified in ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999; however the protocol given in the standard is really germane to measurement of significant leakage, e. g., several percent of the sampling flow rate. In the present study, a technique for quantifying leakage was developed and that approach {{was used to measure}} the sealing integrity of a CAM and two kinds of <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> The methodology involves use of sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer gas with the device being tested operated under dynamic flow conditions. The leak rates in these devices were determined in the pressure range from 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) vacuum to 2. 49 kPa (10 In. H 2 O) pressure at a typical flow rate of 56. 6 L/min (2 cfm). For the two <b>filter</b> <b>holders,</b> the leak rates were less than 0. 007 % of the nominal flow rate. The leak rate in the CAM was less than 0. 2 % of the nominal flow rate. These values are well within the limit prescribed in the ANSI standard, which is 5 % of the nominal flow rate. Therefore the limit listed in the ANSI standard should be reconsidered as lower values can be achieved, and the methodology presented herein can be used to quantify lower leakage values in sample collectors and analyzers. A theoretical analysis was also done to determine the nature of flow through the leaks and the amount of flow contribution by the different possible mechanisms of flow through leaks...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to verify that the Generic Effluent Monitoring System (GEMS), as applied to the AP- 40 exhauster stack, meets all applicable regulatory performance criteria for air sampling systems at nuclear facilities. These performance criteria address both the suitability of the air sampling probe location and the transport of the sample to the collection devices. The criteria covering air sampling probe location ensure that the contaminants in the stack are well mixed with the airflow at the probe location such that the extracted sample represents the whole. The sample transport criteria ensure that the sampled contaminants are quantitatively delivered to the collection device. The specific performance criteria are described in detail in the report. The tests demonstrated that the GEMS/AP- 40 system meets all applicable performance criteria. The contaminant mixing tests {{were conducted}} by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) at the wind tunnel facility, 331 -H Building, using a mockup of the actual stack. The particle sample transport tests were conducted by PNNL at the Numatec Hanford Company`s 305 Building.

40|$|Abstract—When dust is {{collected}} {{by means of}} <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> for industrial hygiene measure-ments, quite low winds can cause serious errors which are often completely ignored. Collection efficiencies are presented for a filter-holder dust sampler now being used for dust measurements at British coke ovens. When the holder faces the wind, efficiency initially increases with particle size to above 100 per cent, but above about 15 nm efficiency falls. It probably increases again at larger particle sizes. Efficiency rapidly falls with increasing particle size when the holder is side-on to the wind. Dust measurements were made in a dusty place on a coke oven, with one sampler facing, and another side-on to, a 2 - 6 m s- 1 wind. The ratio of the concentrations measured by the two samplers was about 4 for total dust, but only about 1 - 5 for the benzene-soluble matter (BSM), suggesting that the BSM was concentrated on the smaller particles. These ratios are probably overestimates of the normal sampling errors.

40|$|International audienceTransmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) offers a very comprehensive tool for individual particle analysis allowing {{the determination of}} size, morphology, specific surface, and elemental composition. This information is needed in aerosol studies, especially {{in the field of}} nanomaterials. However, observations with TEM require a controlled sampling on an adapted analysis support, namely TEM grid. Techniques allowing sampling on TEM grids are of great interest to aerosol analysis. Indeed, sample preparation is not required, thereby gaining time and avoiding a risk for the sample to be altered. The present study evaluates the efficiency of a new particle collection technique based on filtration through one class of TEM-dedicated supports, namely TEM porous grids. Two types of porous grids, considered as the best on the market for this application, have been put to the test: the 'Quantifoil' type porous grid, which has a regular structure, and the 'Holey' type (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, England). A <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> has been developed specifically for this application, the MPS (Mini-Particle Sampler, Ecomesure, Janvry, France).
