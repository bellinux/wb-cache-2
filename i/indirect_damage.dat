5|$|Ganteaume {{selected}} 11 {{ships of}} the line for the operation, including the 120-gun first rate Impérial, flagship of Vice Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues, who was to sail to the Caribbean with four other ships {{of the line}}, two frigates and a corvette. His squadron carried over 1,000 French soldiers to augment the garrison on Santo Domingo under General Jean-Louis Ferrand, and was then required to spend two months blockading Jamaica before cruising along the American Eastern Seaboard to Newfoundland, returning to France when food supplies ran low. The other squadron was given to Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez in Foudroyant, with orders to cruise the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic before sailing to the Leeward Islands, communicating with the French colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Cayenne and blockading Barbados. When British opposition became too strong, he was {{to return to the}} South Atlantic off Saint Helena, also returning to France once food supplies ran low. His squadron consisted of six ships of the line, two frigates and two brigs, and included among its captains Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor's younger brother. Although both squadrons carried six months provisions, they were expected to capture more during their voyages and it was intended that their raiding operations should last as long as 14 months, causing severe <b>indirect</b> <b>damage</b> to the British economy by restricting the movement of trade.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} dreadnoughts {{were intended}} {{to take part in}} a pitched battle against other battleships at ranges of up to [...] In such an encounter, shells would fly on a relatively flat trajectory, and a shell would have to hit at or just about the waterline to damage the vitals of the ship. For this reason, the early dreadnoughts' armour was concentrated in a thick belt around the waterline; this was [...] thick in Dreadnought. Behind this belt were arranged the ship's coal bunkers, to further protect the engineering spaces. In an engagement of this sort, there was also a lesser threat of <b>indirect</b> <b>damage</b> to the vital parts of the ship. A shell which struck above the belt armour and exploded could send fragments flying in all directions. These fragments were dangerous but could be stopped by much thinner armour than what would be necessary to stop an unexploded armour-piercing shell. To protect the innards of the ship from fragments of shells which detonated on the superstructure, much thinner steel armour was applied to the decks of the ship.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{specific}} features of the mechanisms responsible {{for the development of}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors and to reveal its differential diagnostic signs. Materials and methods. Lung morphological changes were studied creating experimental models of ARDS of various genesis in 75 outbred male albino rats weighing 300 — 400 g, which included the direct damaging factor acidine-pepsin aspiration (Group 1, n= 25) and the <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factor blood loss (Group 2, n= 50). Prospective examinations were made in 73 patients (43 men and 30 women, whose age was 21 to 69 years) with ARDS caused by direct damaging factors, such as aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, blunt chest injury, and pulmonary contusion (37 patients, including 21 men and 16 women) and in those with ARDS caused by <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors, such as abdominal sepsis, severe concomitant injury, and hemorrhagic shock (36 patients, including 22 men and 14 women). Results. The study has shown that ARDS caused by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors is characterized by different developmental mechanisms and lung morphological changes that underlie the specific features of functional impairments. Conclusion. The findings made it possible to substantiate and propose new approaches to the differential diagnosis and treatment of ARDS caused by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} efficiency of escalation and de-escalation procedures for optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from direct and in <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors. Subjects and methods. During a prospective study, 46 examined patients (30 men, 16 women; their age was 21 to 67 years) with ARDS of different genesis were divided into 2 groups: 1) 22 patients (14 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were direct damaging factors: gastric content aspiration, blunt chest injury with lung contusion, and acute bilateral bacterial pneumonia; 2) 24 patients (16 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors: abdominal sepsis, severe nonthoracic injury, and acute massive blood loss. In Groups 1 and 2, {{the efficiency of the}} escalation and de-escalation procedures for PEEP optimization was compared during controlled MV with a managed object. Results. In the patients with ARDS caused by direct damaging factors, the escalation procedure for PEEP optimization was more effective than the de-escalation one. In those with ARDS caused by <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors, the de-escalation procedure for PEEP optimization was more effective than the escalation one. Conclusion. It is expedient to use a differential approach to choosing an escalation or de-escalation procedure for PEEP optimization in patients with ARDS induced by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors.

Subjects and methods. The results of treatment were retrospectively analyzed in 185 patients (122 men and 63 women whose age varied 18 to 69 years) with ARDS resulting from aspiration pneumonitis, bilateral pneumonia, or lung contusion (84 patients, including 53 men and 31 women) or from abdominal sepsis, polytrauma, or hemorrhagic shock (101 patients, including 69 men and 32 women). The efficiency of a lung opening maneuver, mechanical ventilation in the prone position, Surfactant BL, perftoran, and their combination use in ARDS developing due to direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors was studied. Results. The study treatment modalities were ascertained to show varying clinical efficiency in patients with ARDS caused by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors. Conclusion.

40|$|I {{employ a}} {{typology}} of disaster impacts that distinguishes between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damages.</b> Direct damages are {{the damage to}} fixed assets and capital (including inventories), damages to raw materials and extractable natural resources, and of course mortality and morbidity that are {{a direct consequence of}} the natural phenomenon. <b>Indirect</b> <b>damages</b> refer to the economic activity, in particular the production of goods and services, that will not take place following the disaster and because of it. These <b>indirect</b> <b>damages</b> may be caused by the direct damages to physical infrastructure or harm to labor, or because reconstruction pulls resources away from the usual production practices. These <b>indirect</b> <b>damages</b> also include the additional costs that are incurred because of the need to use alternative and potentially inferior means of production and/or distribution for the provision of normal goods and services (Pelling et al., 2002). These costs can be accounted for in the aggregate by examining the overall performance of the economy, as measured through the most relevant macroeconomic variables, in particular GDP, the fiscal accounts, consumption, investment, and, especially important for the comparatively globalized countries of the Pacific Rim, the balance of trade and the balance of payments. These costs can also be further divided, following the standard distinction in macroeconomics, between the short run (up to several years) and the long run (typically considered to be at least five years, but sometimes also measured in decades). I use these distinctions in the discussion that follows...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} efficiency of undifferentiated and differentiated use of escalation and de-escalation procedures for optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors. Subjects and methods. During a prospective study, 24 examined patients (16 men, 8 women; their age was 22 to 65 years) with ARDS of different genesis were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n= 11; 7 men, 4 women) and Group B (n= 13; 9 men, 4 women) included patients with ARDS arising from both direct (gastric content aspiration, blunt chest injury with lung contusion, and acute bilateral bacterial pneumonia) and indirect (abdominal sepsis, severe nonthoracic injury, and acute massive blood loss) damaging factors. The results of treatment via differentiated or undifferentiated, according {{to the cause of}} ARDS, use of escalation and de-escalation procedures for PEEP optimization were assessed in Groups A and B patients. Results. The differentiated, according to the cause of ARDS, use of escalation and de-escalation procedures for PEEP optimization makes it possible to more effectively improve the parameters of pulmonary gas exchange and biomechanics and to reduce the length of respiratory support and stay in the intensive care unit, the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and mortality rates in patients with ARDS resulting from direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>damaging</b> factors. Conclusion. It is advisable to apply the differentiated, according to the cause of ARDS, approach to choosing escalation or de-escalation procedures to optimize PEEP in patients with ARDS of different genesis.
