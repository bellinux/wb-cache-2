5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When he <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the under-18s as a 15 year old, he {{stood out in}} the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> use in 1976.

The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$1.12 to 7.20 for a typical month of treatment. In the United States it usually costs less than $25 a month.|$|E
5|$|Kilner <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was {{considered}} a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox {{to the point where}} they disapproved of some of his unusual, eccentric shots. For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the order, but batted between number seven and number nine for England. If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was particularly effective while playing the drive and pull shot. For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a bowler.|$|E

5|$|Remnants {{of several}} Neolithic and Chalcolithic {{cultures}} {{were found in}} all regions of Croatia, {{but most of the}} sites are found in the river valleys of northern Croatia, including Slavonia. The most significant cultures whose presence was found include the Starčevo culture whose finds were discovered near Slavonski Brod and dated to 6100–5200BC, Vučedol and Baden cultures. Most finds attributed to the Baden and Vučedol cultures are discovered in the area around Vukovar, extending to Osijek and Vinkovci. The Baden culture sites in Slavonia are dated to 3600–3300BC, and Vučedol culture finds are dated to 3000–2500BC. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture. Much later, the region was settled by Illyrians and other tribes, including the Pannonians, who controlled much of present-day Slavonia. Even though archaeological finds of Illyrian settlements are much sparser than in areas closer to the Adriatic Sea, significant discoveries, for instance in Kaptol near Požega have been made. The Pannonians <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> contact with the Roman Republic in 35 BC, when the Romans conquered Segestica, or modern-day Sisak. The conquest was completed in 11 BC, when the Roman province of Illyricum was established, encompassing modern-day Slavonia as well as a vast territory on the right bank of Danube. The province was renamed Pannonia and divided within two decades.|$|E
5|$|The Meteorological Flight <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> {{being on}} 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged {{at sea level}} to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of single engine aircraft were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the aneroid capsule altimeter {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN altimeter was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

Though neither a Jew by birth nor by belief, he ended up frequenting the group's meeting, eventually holding lectures himself. Solomon Rappaport, later known as S.
