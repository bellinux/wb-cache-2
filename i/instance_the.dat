5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to convey the information involved in a single event. For <b>instance,</b> <b>the</b> event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of a verb ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{polynomial}} time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known.

5|$|Because the law grants a {{municipality}} significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities {{are currently}} dry.

5|$|Both spiders and {{scorpions}} are venomous, {{so their}} threat displays can be considered generally aposematic. However, some predators such as hedgehogs and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, so when a hedgehog is startled by, for <b>instance,</b> <b>the</b> sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe the display as deimatic.|$|E

5|$|For <b>instance,</b> <b>the</b> {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for <b>instance,</b> <b>the</b> ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
