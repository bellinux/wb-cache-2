50|$|Regional {{standards}} bodies also exist, {{such as the}} European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in Europe, the Pacific Area Standards Congress (PASC), the Pan American Standards Commission (COPANT), the African Organization for Standardization (ARSO), the Arabic industrial development and mining organization (AIDMO), and others.|$|E
50|$|CENELEC (Comité Européen de Normalisation Électrotechnique; European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization)</b> is {{responsible}} for European standardization {{in the area of}} electrical engineering. Together with ETSI (telecommunications) and CEN (other technical areas), it forms the European system for technical standardization. Standards harmonised by these agencies are regularly adopted in many countries outside Europe which follow European technical standards. Although CENELEC works closely with the European Union, it is not an EU institution.|$|E
50|$|The CEN {{was founded}} in 1961. Its thirty four {{national}} members work together to develop European Standards (ENs) in various sectors to build a European internal market {{for goods and services}} and to position Europe in the global economy. CEN is officially recognised as a European standards body by the European Union; the other official European standards bodies are the European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).|$|E
50|$|The {{series of}} European Standards EN 50436 „Alcohol {{interlocks}} - Test methods and performance requirements“ are developed since the year 2013 {{by the committee}} BTTF 116-2 „Alcohol interlocks“ of the European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC). The members have been nominated by the national standardisation organisations of numerous European countries. They represent ministries, road traffic authorities, road safety organisations, labour unions, testing laboratories as well as manufacturers of alcohol interlocks and vehicles. The secretariat of the committee is organized by Deutsche Kommission Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik im DIN und VDE (DKE).|$|E
50|$|Since the 15th edition (1981), these {{regulations}} have closely followed the corresponding international standard IEC 60364. In 1992, the IEE Wiring Regulations became British Standard BS 7671 {{so that the}} legal enforcement of their requirements was easier both {{with regard to the}} Electricity at Work regulations and from an international point of view. They are now treated similar to other British Standards. BS 7671 has converged towards (and is largely based on) the European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC) harmonisation documents, and therefore is technically very similar to the current wiring regulations of other European countries.|$|E
5000|$|The organization's Board and Certification Committee {{provides}} independent governance. BASEC is Government-nominated and accredited by UKAS, demonstrating competence, impartiality {{and reliability}} {{in its ability}} to deliver results. BASEC {{is a member of the}} HAR agreement group of European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC). This provides certification to harmonised cables within Europe in accordance with the harmonization standard. BASEC provides HAR scheme certification to manufacturers based in the UK and Ireland, where certified cables are marked with the approval legend [...] BASEC is affiliated with and supports the work of the Approved Cables Initiative (ACI) in seeking a cross market solution to the problem of sub-standard and counterfeit cable in the UK market.|$|E
50|$|The main {{objective}} of the CPR is the removal of technical barriers to trade in order to guarantee the free movement of construction products within the common internal market due to differing product and test standards, approval processes and conformity documents in the various member states. Key element to this, are the Harmonized Product Standard and the European Technical Approval. Harmonized standards are established by the European standardizations bodies CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and Cenelec (European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization)</b> with the involvement of stakeholders. Where a manufacturer would like to declare the characteristics for a construction product not yet covered by a harmonized product standard, he may use the procedure to establish a European technical assessment.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, voice {{evacuation}} {{systems are}} normally a mandatory requirement for rail and air transport terminals, high-rise buildings, schools, hospitals, {{and other large}} facilities. Voice systems for emergency use date back {{at least as far}} as the second world war. Following the lead of companies like Avalon, Tannoy and Millbank Electronics etc., in the 1980s many other companies such as ASL, Application Solutions (Safety and Security) Ltd began producing voice-evacuation systems. In the 1990s, voice evacuation started to become the standard for large facilities, and is still growing in popularity. The use, design, operation and installation of Voice evacuation systems is governed in Europe by CENELEC European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> EN 60849 and in the UK by the British Standard BS 5839-Part 8, a system code of practice. This is joined by the European harmonised equipment standards family EN 54, and ISO 7240-16:2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: With the {{widespread}} of {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) as a primary source of illumination, visible light communication (VLC) {{offers a lot of}} potentials by providing both resources and energy saving advantages. This paper presents a practical implementation of an integration of Power Line Communication (PLC) and VLC. The system uses spread frequency shift keying (S-FSK) and on-off keying (OOK) in the PLC and VLC channel respectively. The system is of low complexity, low cost and dedicated to enhance low data rate application of PLC technology. The practical design is compatible with the European Committee for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization</b> (CENELEC) band A and the test are done on a Chinese home environment where the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) specifies a 3 kHz to 500 kHz band. Results illustrating the effect of sunlight on this system are presented...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} considerable interest in devising appropriate means for measuring how well test methods suit their avowed purpose. One {{of the major}} expressions of this interest has been through implementation of standards and guidelines issued by ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission) and, in Europe, CEN/CENELEC (European Committee for Standardization/European Commission for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Standardization).</b> Among {{the goals of the}} ISO 9000 family of International Standards is provision of quality system guidelines [1] to complement the specific product requirements that are typically incorporated in specifications provided by “customers”. These criteria are intended to aid “suppliers” in achieving continuing improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction. Four key “facets of quality” are identified, associated with a) definition of needs for the product; b) aspects of product design that influence performance of the product; c) consistency in conforming to the product design; and d) providing life-cycle product support...|$|E
