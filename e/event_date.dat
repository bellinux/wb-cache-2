500|$|On {{the first}} day of 2008, TNA updated their {{official}} website to publicize the official dates for all of their PPV events to take place that year. The next installment in the Turning Point chronology was [...] scheduled for December 14, 2008. The date was later changed to December 21, and the location was announced as the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. In October 2008, three events were rescheduled: Genesis, Final Resolution, and Turning Point. The first moved was Turning Point to the Genesis <b>event</b> <b>date</b> of November 9, while Final Resolution was announced for some time in December. Genesis was later announced to be taking place in Charlotte, North Carolina on January 11, 2009. The song Indestructible by the rock band Disturbed was used as the official theme of the event. The promotional poster for the gathering, featuring Mick Foley, was released through PPV providers.|$|E

30|$|The {{rationale}} behind the Event Detection Validity Assessment {{is that if}} the detected <b>event</b> <b>dates</b> in fact represent dates with high informational value, there should be more information published on or around the detected <b>event</b> <b>dates</b> than on other transaction dates.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, placing Detected <b>Event</b> <b>Dates,</b> monthly {{aggregated}} {{for years}} 2006 and 2007, next to monthly announcements for years 2006 and 2007, we may observe that the Announcement seasonality mentioned earlier {{does not apply}} to the Detected <b>Event</b> <b>Dates</b> produced through the Event Detection process. As a result, we may regard that Observation Dates included within the (− 20) to (+ 20) timeframe represent the population of transactions and announcements relieved from seasonality bias. The only bias that exists is the fact that observations are aligned around Detected <b>Event</b> <b>Dates</b> which are supposed to represent observations with high informational value. Removing the (− 1) to (+ 1) observations, though, permits us stating that the (− 20) to (− 2) and (+ 2) to (+ 20), Sample A, represents the population of transactions and announcements relieved from Detected <b>Event</b> <b>Dates</b> bias.|$|R
2500|$|Emelianenko was {{slated to}} compete on [...] in South Korea at the event Fighting Mixed Combative 2 against Bulgarian Sambo {{practitioner}} Blagoi Ivanov, who had defeated Emelianenko's brother Fedor in the 2008 World Sambo Championships, but Ivanov injured {{his hands in a}} previous match against Kazuyuki Fujita, which left the <b>event</b> <b>date</b> in the air, so Emelianenko decided to withdraw from the event altogether.|$|E
2500|$|With the Miss America 2014 pageant, held on September 15, 2013, the {{competition}} returned to Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey. Miss New York (Nina Davuluri) won {{the title of}} Miss America. Davuluri {{was also the first}} Indian-American and second Asian-American to win the crown. Shortly after her win, however, Davuluri became the target of xenophobic and racist comments in social media relating the proximity of the <b>event</b> <b>date</b> to the 9/11 anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment. News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas 2013, Theresa Vail, (a soldier who won the [...] "America's Choice" [...] award and was the first contestant to display tattoos during the swimsuit competition). Davuluri said that she was prepared for this backlash because [...] "as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks", and Vail denounced the social media backlash, offering her support to Davuluri. In addition, a torn ACL and MCL forced Miss Florida 2013, Myrrhanda Jones, to perform her baton routine with a decorated leg brace, while Nicole Kelly (Miss Iowa 2013) was the first contestant without a forearm to compete in the pageant.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} moments of the pageant, Miss California Crystal Lee and Miss New York Nina Davuluri were the last contestants left on the stage. They were {{approached}} by co-host Lara Spencer who asked how they were feeling at that moment. Davuluri stated that she and Lee were [...] "both so proud. We’re making history right here, standing here as Asian-Americans.” However, shortly after Davuluri was crowned Miss America 2014, xenophobic and racist comments relating {{the proximity of the}} <b>event</b> <b>date</b> to the nine-eleven anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment appeared in American social media. News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas Theresa Vail. Davuluri said that she was prepared for the social media response because [...] "as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks." [...] Davuluri is the second Miss Syracuse to win the title after Miss New York 1983, Vanessa Lynn Williams who was the first African American winner and Miss America 1984. Both Davuluri and Williams won when the pageant was held in Atlantic City and both faced a backlash over their respective wins. In addition, Congressperson Grace Meng compared Davuluri to Miss New York 1945, Bess Myerson (the first and to date only Jewish-American winner and Miss America 1945) who also faced bigotry during her time as Miss America.|$|E
