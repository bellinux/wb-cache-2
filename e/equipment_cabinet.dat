40|$|Objectives. The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to regulate the thermal regime and ensure the reliability of electronic equipment Methods. In order to conduct experimental studies of the thermoelectric cooling system using heat pipes, a stand was assembled on which the developed and manufactured prototype was studied. The object of the experimental studies was a prototype cooling system, consisting of a thermoelectric battery made of conventional unified thermoelectric materials of ICE- 71 type. The solution of the research problems carried out by the method of reduction to ordinary differential equations (Kantorovich method) provides acceptable accuracy for such a class of problems. Results.  A design of a telecommunication <b>equipment</b> <b>cabinet</b> with a thermal management system based on the use of heat pipes and thermoelectric cooling units is proposed. A mathematical model for the determination of the thermal field in the cabinet volume is considered; an experimental stand for the prototype study is described; the results of experimental studies for various power sources of heat release are presented. Conclusion. Experimental studies confirm the operability of the developed cooling system for cabinets with telecommunication equipment; this cooling method has advantages over conventional forced or natural cooling; the temperature in the block volume and the peak values of the heat sources are significantly reduced; at dissipation powers on one board within 50 W there is no need to use special means to remove heat from hot junctions of the thermoelectric battery. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several aspects}} of gradient and shim coil design and fabrication. New design techniques are coupled with experimental construction methods to expand small animal insert gradient and shim technology. The design techniques are also applied {{to other areas of}} magnetic resonance hardware. A custom 2 -axis gradient insert coil is designed and fabricated for the purpose of eddy current characterization. The construction tolerances were examined via bench top inductance measurements and eddy currents measurement inside a 7. 0 T head-only MR system. A great deal of freedom is available when positioning shielding coils with respect to their corresponding primary coils in small animal inserts before eddy currents become prohibitive for imaging. A new method for actively shielding electromagnets is presented. The minimum energy method for designing shielding coils of any geometry is developed and validated against historical methods. Several shielded gradient insert coils are designed, including a cylindrical gradient set with rectangular shields, which demonstrates the versatility of this new method. The performance of the shielded insert coils is reported. A high power custom shim insert coil is designed and optimized for dynamic shimming applications. This 10 -axis shim insert coil is designed to operate at currents higher than any previously existing shim sets. Several experimental fabrication methods are tested during the construction of the insert coil. Inductance, resistance and cooling measurements are conducted and compared to design specifications. Field measurements are taken using a 3 -axis field transducer and the shim efficiencies are calculated. Finally mutual inductance measurements are taken between strongly coupled axes to verify active shielding performance. Lastly, the minimum energy method for active shielding is applied to several MR fringe field type problems. Shields are designed to conform to rooms within an imaging facility for the purpose of controlling the magnetic footprint of an MR system. The MR room itself it designed to house an active shield, along with rooms adjacent to the MR room and a small <b>equipment</b> <b>cabinet</b> located inside the MR room is also fitted with a shield. The performance of the shields is calculated, and the feasibility of such shields is discussed...|$|E

50|$|Its {{business}} {{strategy has been}} based upon introduction of leading edge speeds, initially with 10 Gb/second, and as of 2013, 100 Gb/second and 500 Gb/second based upon Superchannels (or combining channels).

These higher level speeds are enabled by the use of Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC) which combine digital circuitry and photonic circuitry in a hybrid multi-layer (3-D) component.
