500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening. Flynn {{originally}} presented it to the band as [...] "The Thrashterpiece" [...] which became the songs working title, because according to Flynn [...] "it owes a huge debt to the band Exodus, (there's) a lot of Bay Area thrash worship <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> song." [...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I {{was glad to see}} that part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording. Production duties were handled by Flynn with assistance from Mark Keaton, and mixing by Colin Richardson.|$|E

Yahaira Toribio of Terra called the video will.i.am's [...] "high-end technological wonderland" [...] and wrote that [...] "for all the choreography <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> clip...all we get is [...] standing and sitting pretty."

500|$|Roger Friedman of Fox News {{called the}} film a [...] "4 star opera", noting that while long, {{there was plenty}} of humor and action. Andy Khouri of Comic Book Resources praised the film as [...] "easily the most complex and deftly orchestrated superhero epic ever filmed [...] despite the {{enormous}} amount of characters, action and sci-fi superhero plot <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film, Spider-Man 3 never feels weighted down, tedious or boring." [...] Jonathan Ross, a big fan of the comic books, felt the film was the best of the trilogy. Richard Corliss of Time commended the filmmakers for their ability to [...] "dramatize feelings of angst and personal betrayal worthy of an Ingmar Bergman film, and then to dress them up in gaudy comic-book colors". Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe, who gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, wrote that it was a well-made, fresh film, but would leave the viewer [...] "overfulfilled". Jonathan Dean of Total Film felt the film's complex plot helped the film's pacing, in that, [...] "it rarely feels disjointed or loose [...] Spider-Man cements its shelf-life." [...] Entertainment Weekly named the Sandman as the eighth best computer-generated film character.|$|E

500|$|There are two {{different}} music videos for [...] "American Life", {{the first of which}} was not released by Madonna. It was shot {{in the first week of}} February 2003 at Los Angeles Center Studios in Los Angeles, California by Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund, who worked with Madonna in the videos for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998) and [...] "Music" [...] (2000). Madonna had the idea for the music video in November 2002, then she and Åkerlund developed the idea to make an anti-war and anti-fashion mini-movie. With [...] "American Life", she took her music videos to a different level by focusing on war, politics and, according to media interpretation, the then-upcoming invasion of Iraq. [...] "It is an antiwar statement..." [...] she subsequently clarified, [...] "but it's not necessarily against this war. At any given moment there's at least 30 wars <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world and I'm against all of them." [...] Shortly after it was filmed, Warner Bros. Records released a statement regarding the music video: [...] " [...] expresses a panoramic view of our culture and looming war through the view of a female superhero portrayed by Madonna. Starting as a runway show of couture army fatigues, the fashion show escalates into a mad frenzy depicting the catastrophic repercussions and horrors of war." [...] An exclusive sneak peek of the video was available on VH1's program Backstage at the Grammys.|$|E
500|$|Six {{areas were}} studied for wild pallid {{sturgeon}} population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS {{has referred to}} these six areas of wild population studies as [...] "recovery priority management areas" [...] (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the Marias River in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, and the lower Yellowstone River up to {{the confluence of the}} Tongue River, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the Niobrara River to Lewis and Clark Lake along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected during the study period. Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.|$|E
500|$|... "Millennium" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the entry [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "visually captivating", particularly praising the installment's [...] "use {{of light and}} dark symbolism". Ultimately, he noted that [...] "it's good to once again see Mulder and Scully temporarily set free from the show's overarching conspiracy." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "there were a lot of big, big things <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> ep , starting with Millenniums ace profiler Frank Black [...] reluctantly helping Mulder and Scully solve the apparent suicides of four FBI agents." [...] Rosell ultimately concluded that the reason the episode was a success was due to Mulder and Scully's kiss, a moment he called [...] "inevitable" [...] although he did note that [...] "many think [...] really signaled the beginning of the end." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review and called it [...] "highly entertaining" [...] and [...] "cause for celebration". He noted that, while he had never seen an episode of Millennium, the series mythology and story-arcs [...] "integrated seamlessly into this episode" [...] in a way that non-Millennium fans could still enjoy it. John Drake of Xposé considered the episode [...] "excellent" [...] and rated it 5 stars out of 5. Drake commended Lance Henriksen's performance, saying that [...] "not only provides continuity with Millennium, but adds a new dimension as Frank tries to leave the wreckage of his professional life behind". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". He called the entry [...] "tired" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "both too ambitious and not epic enough" [...] to bring closure to Millennium. Furthermore, he felt that the story's basic plot was too confusing and almost laughable. Despite this, he enjoyed Johnson's role as the villain, calling him [...] "interesting", and he wrote that the scene with Mulder and Black in the cellar was [...] "kind of cool" [...] because of the [...] "creepy zombie sequences".|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the Band's [...] "grittily distinctive" [...] sound coming together, according to Hoskyns. Its author, Robertson, has explained that it was based on an actual Yazoo Street in a town in Arkansas, Helm's home state: [...] "I thought, 'Wow, they don't have streets like that in Canada. There's no streets up there called Yazoo!' It was like, 'Jesus, let me make up a little story here about stuff <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> kind of almost red light district.' Everything was lit in red in that song for me."

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "Once Upon a Time has taken us pretty much everywhere {{in and out of}} fairy tale lore over the past five years: Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest, Arendelle, Neverland. Tonight, with a return marking the show's midseason premiere, as well as its landmark 100th episode, Once gave us something old (daddy issues), something new (the Underworld), something borrowed (a potion) and something blue (that classic Hades hair)," [...] but later sums up the entire episode: [...] "I know we're going to be dealing with a lot of returning cast in the coming weeks, but admittedly, I was a wee bit let down by the fact this was touted as Once's big reunion episode, and the only significant people we saw from the past were Neal, Cora, and Pan. What I am happy about, though, is the prospect that Regina may end up being wholly important to this Underworld story line. Maybe she'll finally get an arc that's more than just waffling between good and evil. More importantly, it seems like everyone in the Underworld is either in cahoots with Hades or being manipulated by him in some way. Both Pan and Cora were keen on persuading their still-living significant family members, with Cora asking Regina to leave and Pan asking Rumple to save him. I'm interested in seeing exactly what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> little corner of hell and exactly how Once is going to wade through this new road of storytelling.|$|E
