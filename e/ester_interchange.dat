50|$|The scheme {{involves}} {{first the}} conversion of ortho-trifluoromethyl aniline (1) to a quinolol. The compound is thus condensed with EMME (Ethoxy Methylene Malonic Diethyl Ester) and cyclized thermally (2). That intermediate is then saponified; the resulting acid is decarboxylated and finally converted to the 4-chloroquinoline (3) by reaction with phosphorus oxychloride. The displacement of chlorine with methyl anthranilate (4) then affords the coupled intermediate (5). An <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> of that product with glycerol leads to the glyceryl ester. There is thus obtained the NSAID floctafenine.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{between the}} oils and the enzyme causes the fatty acids of the triglycerides to exchange positions to the -1 and -3 glycerides, thereby altering the chemical composition and physical {{properties of the}} fat. Using a 1,3-specific enzyme, only the fatty acids in the 1,3 positions are shifted around, and the 2-position is untouched. Unsaturated fatty acids in the 2-position are more often found naturally in plant lipids or vegetable oil sources. Allowing the rearrangement of the saturated fatty acids {{to occur in the}} 1-position and 3-position increases the amount of bioavailable unsaturated fatty acids. Enzymes most suitable for this process are esterase; acylase; those enzymes that facilitate acidolysis reactions, transesterification reactions, ester synthesis or <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reactions; enzymes having phospholipase or protease activity, including thermostable and thermotolerant hydrolase activity; and polynucleotides. From the two original fats, six different structures are produced during enzymatic Interesterification. A fixed bed system is the most common commercial process used for enzymatic interesterification. In a fixed bed process, the blended liquid oil and solid (hard fat) oil flow through a system consisting of an oil purification bed and an enzyme bed. The oil purification bed removes impurities from the oil blend so that the enzyme activity can be maintained at its highest performance. The enzyme bed allows for the enzymatic interesterification of the oil blend as the blend passes through the bed.|$|E

40|$|The {{polycondensation}} of PET through <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> is {{a process}} strongly limited by mass transport effects. Therefore, design and scale up of industrial PET plants require a detailed knowledge of micro and macro kinetics. In this work, a comprehensive model for the polycondensation of PET has been developed taking into account 1) kinetic data, 2) equilibrium data, 3) diffusion processes for the major by-products EG and water in the molten PET. The model was validated using own experimental data determined by thermogravimetric analysis. As a sample, so called “PET-prepolymer ” was used. The kinetic parameters for the <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reaction, for the water formation through esterification {{as well as for}} the most significant side reactions were taken from the literature. The mass transport was described using the classical diffusion equation according to Fick’s law and a modified Wilke-Chang diffusion model.

40|$|<b>Ester</b> <b>interchange,</b> alcoholysis, and {{acidolysis}} of polypivalolactone (PPVL) {{were studied}} by melting PPVL with bisphenol diacetates, 1, 4 -butanediol, or aromatic diacids. Interchange of PPVL with the diacetates and the diol occured readily, {{in particular in}} the presence of a titanium catalyst. Melting PPVL with 10 mol-% of bisphenol-Adiacetate {{in the presence of}} 0, 5 wt. % tetrabutylorthotitanate resulted in an incorporation of 33 % of the diacetate in the polymer chains, whereas the logarithmic viscosity number decreased by 81 %. The <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> was suggested to proceed by an initial cleavage of ester bonds in the polymer chain of PPVL, resulting in the formation of shorter chains, followed by a reaction between the newly formed ester end-groups and initially present hydroxyl chain ends. The acidolysis of PPVL with the diacids proved to be less effective; in the case of the acidolysis of PPVL with 10 mol-% isophthalic acid, less than 1 % of the diacid was incorporated in the polymer chains and a decrease in the logarithmic viscosity number of only 22 % was found. Both the high stability of the ester bond in PPVL towards acids in general and the heterogeneity of these systems were supposed to cause the behaviour of PPVL with respect to acidolysis. The results concerning the interchange reactions with PPVL were compared with studies on other polyesters...|$|E

The main goal of this research effort was to engineer butterfat with improved nutritional properties {{by taking advantage of}} the sn- 1, 3 specificity and fatty acid specificity of a lipase in hydrolysis and <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reactions, and concomitantly decrease its level of long-chain saturated fatty acid residues (viz., lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids) and change its melting properties. All reactions were carried out at 40 °C in a solvent free system under controlled water activity, and their extent was monitored via chromatographic assays for free fatty acids, esterified fatty acid moieties, and triacylglycerols; the thermal behavior of the modified butterfat was also assessed via calorimetry. Lipase-modified butterfat possesses a wider melting temperature range than regular butterfat. The total saturated triacylglycerols decreased by 2. 2 %, whereas triacylglycerols with 28 – 46 acyl carbons (which contained two or three lauric, myristic, or palmitic acid moieties) decreased by 13 %. The total monoene triacylglycerols increased by 5. 4 %, whereas polyene triacylglycerols decreased by 2. 9 %.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{alternative}} energy sources that combine environmental friendliness with biodegradability, low toxicity, renewability, and less dependence on petroleum products has never been greater. One such energy source {{is referred to as}} biodiesel. This can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, microalgal oils, waste products of vegetable oil refinery or animal rendering, and used frying oils. Chemically, they are known as monoalkyl esters of fatty acids. The conventional method for producing biodiesel involves acid and base catalysts to form fatty acid alkyl esters. Downstream processing costs and environmental problems associated with biodiesel production and byproducts recovery have led to the search for alternative production methods and alternative substrates. Enzymatic reactions involving lipases can be an excellent alternative to produce biodiesel through a process commonly referred to alcoholysis, a form of transesterification reaction, or through an interesterification (<b>ester</b> <b>interchange)</b> reaction. Protein engineering can be useful in improving the catalytic efficiency of lipases as biocatalysts for biodiesel production. The use of recombinant DNA technology to produce large quantities of lipases, and the use of immobilized lipases and immobilized whole cells, may lower the overall cost, while presenting less downstream processing problems, to biodiesel production. In addition, the enzymatic approach is environmentally friendly, considered a "green reaction", and needs to be explored for industrial production of biodiesel...|$|E

Blends with PET/PBT compositions of 100 / 0, 97 / 3, 90 / 10, 60 / 40, 50 / 50, 40 / 60, 25 / 75 and 0 / 100 %w/w were prepared by precipitation from solutions of the two polymers at the required concentrations. Blends were heat treated to induce <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reactions for a) 6 hours at 476 K and b) 1 / 2 hour at 573 K. NMR data showed that the samples iieat treated for 6 hours at 476 K were block copolymers and the samples heat treated for 1 / 2 hour at 573 K were random copolymers. DSC, WAXS and SAXS experiments established the morphology of the blends, block and random copolymers. SANS experiments were carried out to study the kinetics of transesterification of PET/PBT copolyesters. Deuterated PET has been synthesised.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{factors for}} 16 U. S. EPA priority {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) from the polylactic acid (PLA) pyrolysis and the decomposition mechanism were investigated in this study. The fragments and gas compositions using on-line thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) were determined. A temperature series of 7 fragments was analyzed in helium, and was found to include: m/z = 16, which may represent methane; 28, which may be carbon monoxide; 44, which may be acetaldehyde; 56, which may be methylketene, 144, which may be oligomers of lactide. In addition, there are little amount of 100, and 200 which are oligomers of lactides observed in the pyrolysis of PEA. The pyrolysis of PEA is a non-radical, backbiting <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reaction involving the OH chain ends. Depending {{on the size of}} the cyclic transition state, the product can be a lactide molecule, an oligomeric ring with more than two repeat units, methylketene, or acetaldehyde. Carbon monoxide and methane are contributions from the decomposition of acetaldehyde. Experimentally, not detected (n. d.) - 40. 47 mu g of 16 PAH emissions were determined from per gram of PIA pyrolysis. The PAH profiles showed a predominance of naphthalene (58. 9 %), phenanthrene (12. 5 %), and fluoranthene (5. 9 %). The total PAH emissions for PIA pyrolysis is significantly lower than the values associated with PEA combustion. From the viewpoint of air pollution control, this result suggests that pyrolysis seems a better alternative than combustion for the disposal of waste PIA. Also, since pyrolysis is the first step for an incineration process, these results can provide important information on the control of PAHs formation for a commercialized incinerator.

40|$|A new {{route to}} the AB(_ 2) monomer {{dimethyl}} 5 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) isophthalate and its subsequent polymerisation is reported. Hyperbranched polyesters were prepared by melt condensation polymerisation of the AB(_ 2) monomer and also by copolymerisation with suitable core molecules. Unusual molecular weight growth characteristics were demonstrated. The {{number average molecular weight}} (Mn) reached a plateau value after relatively short polymerisation time, whereas the weight average molecular weight (M(_n)) continued to increase. This limit to the attainable number average molecular weight is thought to be a consequence of intramolecular cyclisation reactions, evidence of which was provided by MALDI-TOF MS. The weight average molecular weight continues to increase after complete cyclisation and it is postulated that this is due to a redistribution of polymer chains by <b>ester</b> <b>interchange</b> reactions. The plausibility of the occurrence of ester exchange processes was demonstrated by the successful incorporation of a dimethyl isophthalate core molecule into a fully cyclised hyperbranched polyester. The amount of branching in the hyperbranched polyesters was in agreement with the theoretical value for a statistical distribution at high conversion, as determined by quantitative (^ 13) C NMR spectroscopy. The solution properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were studied and revealed these materials to be soluble in common organic solvents. Solutions of the hyperbranched polyesters had characteristically low intrinsic viscosities ([n]) and Mark-Houwink plots showed a linear relationship between log M(_w) and log[n]. The thermal properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were examined by differential scanning calorimetry, which showed the polymers to be amorphous materials exhibiting a glass transition temperature (T(_g)) but no melting point. The T(_g) varied with molecular weight, was proportional to 1 /M(_w) and reached a limiting value of 86 ºC at high conversion...|$|E
40|$|Polyphenols, such as tannins, offer {{potential}} as a bio-derived chemical feedstock. Their present utilisation is limited mainly to leather tanning and wood panel adhesives. However, appropriate derivatisation may alter both the chemical and physical properties and thereby allow further utilisation of polyphenols. Derivatisation of polyphenols was achieved by esterification and etherification of the phenol groups. Esterification was achieved by alcoholysis of acid chlorides and transesterification with vinyl esters, while etherification was achieved by the ring opening of propylene oxide. The polyphenols used were resorcinol, catechin, Pinus radiata bark tannin, and Schinopsis lorentzii tannin. The products were characterised using a range of techniques including NMR (1 H, 13 C and 2 D NMR in both the solution and solid state), ESI-MS, GPC, DSC, TGA, and rheology. The preparation of polyphenolic esters by alcoholysis provided model compounds to establish the key chemical, spectroscopic, and physical features. A range of simple polyphenol esters such as resorcinol dilaurate and catechin pentalaurate were prepared using lauroyl chloride. Furthermore, tannin lauroyl esters were prepared {{with varying degrees of}} substitution. A transesterification method was developed for the preparation of polyphenol esters. <b>Ester</b> <b>interchange</b> occurred effectively in the presence of base catalyst in aqueous solution or dimethyl sulfoxide with short or long chain vinyl esters. This included the first report of the base-catalysed transesterification of flavonoids by vinyl esters to give products such as catechin mono- and di-laurate. Transesterification occurred preferentially at the B-ring as shown by NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, this transesterification procedure was used to prepare tannin esters. The chemical and physical properties of polyphenol esters were assessed using thermal, antioxidant, and UV/VIS light absorption analysis. Thermal analysis indicated melt/flow properties for some of the polyphenol esters. In some cases, the thermal stability was also shown to increase upon esterification. The antioxidant activity was shown to decrease upon transesterification of pine bark tannin with vinyl laurate, while the UV/VIS absorption was shown to increase. These properties may lend the products towards applications as polymer additives or pharmaceuticals. Polyphenol ethers were prepared by the Williamson ether synthesis and ring opening of propylene oxide. However, the Williamson ether synthesis, a common route to prepare ethers, proved unsuitable for flavonoids. Catechin and tannin hydroxypropyl ether derivatives of varying substitution were prepared by the ring-opening of propylene oxide in the presence of triethylamine. Upon hydroxypropylation the thermal properties of the polyphenol were altered. For example, catechin hydroxypropyl ethers showed a glass transition, which was dependent upon the molar substitution, while rheology showed melt behaviour for several of the tannin hydroxypropyl ethers...|$|E
