5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's books cover a wide range.

He wrote literary biographies (Conrad, 1916; James Branch Cabell, 1920; and Trollope, 1928); plays; and screenplays including David Copperfield, 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. and had gone through six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her readers would want to <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> original novel after reading hers.

According to Claude Samuel, Boulez wanted to <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> field of rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of György Ligeti. Boulez described it as “a sort of narrative mosaic”.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in other}} cultures, toys {{are used to}} expand the {{development}} of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{mechanism by which}} the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Téchiné {{is noted}} for his elegant and emotionally charged films that often <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{complexities}} of human condition and emotions. An intimist flavor pervades his work. One of the trademarks of his filmography is the lyrical examination of human relations in a sensitive but unsentimental way. Influenced by Roland Barthes, Bertolt Brecht, Ingmar Bergman, William Faulkner and the cinematic French New Wave, the originality of Téchiné's films lies in his subtle exploration {{of sexuality and}} national identity, as he challenges expectations in his depictions of gay relations, the North African dimensions of contemporary French culture, and the center-periphery relationship between Paris and his native Southwest. Shy and ascetic-looking, Téchiné does not opine on political issues and rarely appears on television. Fear of flying prevents him from attending most film openings or festivals more than a train ride from his Paris apartment overlooking the Luxembourg Garden.|$|E

25|$|The Silver Surfer {{made his}} film debut in 20th Century Fox's , {{the sequel to}} the 2005 film Fantastic Four. Doug Jones played the Surfer on set, and a {{computer}} simulation enhanced the reflective look of his prosthetics. Laurence Fishburne provided the character's voice. The same year, 20th Century Fox hired J. Michael Straczynski to write the screenplay for a spin-off film. Straczynski said his script is a sequel, but will also <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Surfer's origins. In mid-2009, Straczynski expressed doubts that spin-off would be produced. In this continuity, the Surfer's origins and powers {{are similar to those}} of his comic-book incarnation, in that he agrees to become Galactus' herald in return for the safety of his home world and the woman he loved. Also, if the Surfer is separated from his board, he becomes weaker; in addition, the board also serves as a beacon for Galactus. 20th Century Fox currently owns the live action film rights to the character.|$|E
25|$|The late 1960s and the 1970s {{witnessed}} {{a reversal of}} the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> real causes.|$|E

25|$|Welles's next turn as {{director}} was the film Mr. Arkadin (1955), which {{was produced by}} his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five {{different versions of the}} film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled Confidential Report. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.|$|E
