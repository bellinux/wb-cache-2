5|$|Catches in 2007 {{amounted}} to 384 Striped Dolphins, 300 Bottlenose Dolphins, 312 Risso's Dolphins and 243 Southern Short <b>Finned</b> Pilot Whales, {{for a total}} of 1,239 animals. These numbers do not include dolphins or other small whale species killed using various other methods, such as offshore harpoon hunts, in which mainly porpoises are killed. Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins, 8 Risso Dolphins, 5 Southern Short <b>Finned</b> Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The quota set by the government for the species that were targeted in drive hunts that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped Dolphins, 1,018 Bottlenose Dolphins, 541 Risso's Dolphins, and 369 Southern Short <b>Finned</b> Pilot Whales. The quota applies to all hunting methods.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, <b>finned</b> mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often <b>finned</b> at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fishmeal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value.|$|E

5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be <b>finned</b> and the carcass discarded.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including <b>finned</b> fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is caught by {{commercial}} and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are {{sold on the}} export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks {{are known to be}} taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of pelagic fisheries, where it is often <b>finned</b> at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area. It {{is believed to have been}} extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in many other parts of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the silvertip shark as Vulnerable.|$|E

50|$|FCS (<b>Fin</b> Control System) is a brand, {{as well as}} type, of <b>fin</b> set-up {{which allows}} for more {{versatility}} in the placement and style of the <b>fins</b> attached to a surfboard. The FCS style {{can be used as}} the traditional tri-fin placement, a four (quad), or a five <b>fin</b> set up. The tri-fin refers to a setup with three <b>fins</b> {{on the underside of the}} board, often with the two outer <b>fins</b> angled inward and middle <b>fin</b> a few inches closer to the end of the tail pointed straight and larger. The five <b>fin</b> placement is similar but with four outer <b>fins</b> and one middle <b>fin</b> (these <b>fins</b> are often smaller).

5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have <b>finned</b> the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often <b>finned</b> at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we provide {{information}} {{on the development of}} the structure and composition of <b>fins</b> in the medaka. The pectoral <b>fins,</b> which begin to form in the embryonic stage, first form their <b>fin</b> rays after hatching prior to the formation of other median and pelvic <b>fins.</b> During the growth period from larvae to juveniles, the unpaired anal, caudal and dorsal <b>fins</b> begin to form before the pronounced degeneration or resorption of the median <b>fin</b> fold in the region of the caudal peduncle. The <b>fin</b> rays first appear in the caudal <b>fin</b> fold at the posterior end of the body, and subsequently <b>fin</b> rays of the anal and pectoral <b>fins</b> arise prior to those of the dorsal <b>fin.</b> Paired pelvic <b>fins</b> begin to sprout on the skin of the bilateral sides of a median ventral <b>fin</b> fold, which regresses concomitant with resorption of the <b>fin</b> fold at the dorsal and ventral regions of the caudal peduncle. After complete resorption of those portions of the ventral <b>fin</b> fold in which <b>fin</b> rays do not arise, the pelvic <b>fin</b> rays form. The pectoral <b>fins</b> are supported by four small radials, the scapulas and the coracoids. Similarly, the pelvic <b>fins</b> are supported by pelvic girdles, the caudal <b>fin</b> by the hypural, and the anal and dorsal <b>fins</b> by distal and proximal pterygiophores. The appearance of these <b>fin</b> appendages closely follows that of <b>fin</b> rays in the <b>fin</b> fold...|$|R
50|$|Removable <b>Fin</b> Systems The {{most common}} types of <b>fins</b> used today, {{removable}} <b>fins</b> are surfboard <b>fins</b> {{that can be}} unscrewed from the surfboard and be replaced by different <b>fins</b> or be moved about the board for a different setup in maneuverability and stability. In the early 90’s three Australian surfers invented the <b>fin</b> control system (FCS). Since its global release in 1994 FCS has become the industry standard; providing elite athletes and everyday surfers an abundance of <b>fin</b> designs and a platform to change {{the performance of their}} surfboard by changing <b>fins.</b> The system also streamlined the surfboard manufacturing process by making it easier to install <b>fins</b> into boards and repair damaged <b>fins.</b> The leading competitor to FCS <b>fins</b> is Futures <b>fins.</b> Using a single larger <b>fin</b> box, the manufacture claims the <b>fins</b> provide a stronger connection and more closely approximate the feeling of a glass on <b>fin.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Tetras {{generally}} have compressed (sometimes deep), [...] bodies and are typically identifiable by their <b>fins.</b> They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal <b>fin</b> (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail <b>fin</b> whose {{upper and lower}} lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal <b>fin</b> characterized by a short connection to the fish’s body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal <b>fin</b> stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal <b>fin</b> and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose <b>fin</b> located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal <b>fins.</b> This adipose <b>fin</b> represents the fourth unpaired <b>fin</b> on the fish (the four unpaired <b>fins</b> include the caudal <b>fin,</b> dorsal <b>fin,</b> anal <b>fin,</b> and adipose <b>fin),</b> lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four.
