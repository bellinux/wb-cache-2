40|$|The {{international}} {{climate of}} cyber security is dramatically changing and thus unpredictable. As such, agile yet sustainable solutions are needed, {{along with an}} effective and a pragmatic evaluation framework to assess and demonstrate the value and efficacy of international development collaboration. Currently, no mature frameworks are available for evaluating such non-conventional, new, and complex international activities as they exist today, and thus this study aims to provide an innovative and pragmatic approach to study cybersecurity. This study recognizes the lack of institutionalized solutions, and aims to provide a novel framework with which to evaluate emerging solutions. In particular, this study evaluates the effectiveness of international development activities and public-private partnerships {{as a way to}} <b>improve</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>security.</b> Guided by literature on strategic philanthropy and international development, this study develops an extended cost-benefit analysis framework and applies it to an in-depth case study of a Korean security agency, its Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT.) This newly extended framework can be used for assessing international programs and activities aimed at improving cyber security, where the costs and benefits are not restricted by traditional boundaries. Unlike conventional approaches, this study explicitly includes three additional critical aspects, which are neglected in the conventional cost benefit analysis framework: 1) synergic effect (such as public-private partnership), 2) indirect impact, and 3) shared value. An in-depth case study with field interviews and technology reviews was conducted to test the applicability of this extended framework. Based on the application to the case of the international development activities of the Korean CERT, this study presents two findings. First, private companies can benefit from participating in government-led international development programs. Second, international development activities are effective solutions to improving global and local cyber security. Repeated applications of this framework to other cases will further assess the generalizability of the framework. Cumulated evidence from evaluating the effectiveness of international development activities will also inform the development of future activities for establishing partnerships of strategic philanthropy to <b>improve</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>security.</b> by Yiseul Cho.

Executive summary Australia’s digital future is set to transform the nation. Our transition towards a more digital economy will drive economic progress, improve social wellbeing, and open up new opportunities for innovation and increased competitiveness on the global stage. Continued technological advancement and rapid adoption are central to our progress, as new developments spur more innovative business models, products and services, which are crucial in responding to key national and sectoral challenges - such as rising healthcare costs, increasing household electricity prices and Government pressures to do more with less. As technology and digital solutions continue to {{play a key role in}} driving the economy and society forward, they become increasingly embedded into business operations, across key service offerings and into our personal lives. Australia’s future is digital, hyperconnected and critically dependent on technology, making strong <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> capability crucial to navigating the associated risks and opportunities ahead. Our increased dependence on technology, combined with the evolving complexity and sophistication of <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> threats, together increase our level of vulnerability – at a national, organisational and individual level. Advancements in technology may be contributing to these evolving security challenges, but they are also a key part of the solution. Developments in data analytics and machine learning are allowing us to better understand network anomalies and harness big data. Progress in cryptography techniques are helping to better secure information. And sophisticated risk management modelling tools are allowing leaders to make more informed cyber decisions. Whilst progress has been made towards <b>improving</b> and advancing <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> solutions, we are at risk of becoming complacent. Amidst an environment of continuous, rapid change, with increasing levels of complexity and uncertainty, we cannot afford to rely solely on past and present solutions. Ensuring Australia’s digital success into the future will require bold <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> leadership and further investment now. It will require ongoing science and technology research that can identify emerging <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> challenges and develop practical solutions. And it will require a cultural shift, extending <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> responsibility out to every organisation, every government, and every individual. Taking this direction requires a change in perspective, recognising that <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> is not solely a technology challenge. It is also a cultural challenge, and one that extends beyond traditional information security practices. Alongside investment in new <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> tools and technologies that can keep pace with evolving threat challenges, our nation’s future strategies require a commitment to <b>improving</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> skills, awareness and education, as well as an imperative to evolve <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> perceptions to understand the central role this capability has in enabling our digital future. Successfully navigating the road ahead will require a whole-of-nation effort, harnessing the full range of resources available across our economy. Alongside existing national and defence-related strategies, the research community in partnership with industry and Government have a vital role to play, through applying innovation and cutting-edge technology to the people, process and technology solutions needed going forward.

40|$|Despite long-standing {{predictions}} that developments in, for example, personal and cloud computing practices {{would change the}} ways in which we approach security, small-scale IT users (SSITUs) remain ill-served by existing <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> practices.

The greatest challenge for many organizations is balancing the breadth and depth of what should be done to mitigate <b>cyber</b> <b>security</b> risks with significant limitations on skills, manpower, and budgets. There are many standards, regulations, and frameworks available that provide prescriptive controls addressing a comprehensive information security program, such as NIST, ISO, PCI and the HITRUST CSF. However, identifying {{the current state of the}} environment, prioritizing remediation actions, and implementing controls can take a great deal of time and money. Even small organizations with a limited scope of assets and information to protect lack the necessary capabilities and resources to address all aspects of security in an acceptable timeframe. In healthcare, this is highlighted in a 2009 Life Sciences and Health Care Study by Deloitte, which cited “budget constraints and/or lack of resources” as the predominant barrier to implementing IT security for Providers (59. 18 % of respondents noted this as an issue). While budgets and resource constraints cannot be directly addressed via a framework, HITRUST and other federal programs such as Meaningful Use have seen success in gaining adoption and making progress for IT security through a focused, phased approach. The objective is to break down the full set of controls and requirements that should be implemented by organizations, and prioritize them over a multi-year period.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{cognitive}} and analytical capabilities are needed and are indispensable {{to success in}} cyber defense. However, the high volume of network data challenges the process of detecting cyber-attacks, especially zero-day attacks. Training along with detailed and timely outcome feedback {{is a major factor}} in improving performance. It supports attributes identification and rule formation, which are crucial to the detection of attacks. To understand the role of feedback during training and how it influences the detection of novel attacks, we developed a simplified Intrusion Detection System and trained 160 participants to perform as analysts. During training, participants classified network events representing a specific cyber-attack, and received feedback {{at the end of each}} trial. Detailed feedback used color schemes informing of hits, misses, false-alarms, and correct-rejections. Aggregated feedback provided numerical summaries regarding performance. After training, participants classified events that were similar or part of a novel attack. Results show that detailed feedback accelerated learning and improved detection accuracy compared to aggregated feedback. Participants who received aggregated feedback failed to learn the role of certain network attributes and how to integrate them into detection rules. Surprisingly, aggregated feedback improved detection in the novel attack. The novelty of a situation caused an increase in decision scrutiny, while familiar decision situations limited the depth of information search and evaluation. Analyst should learn to abstract information and look broadly at outcome feedback to improve their ability to detect novel attacks. We discuss the implications of these findings for <b>improving</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R
