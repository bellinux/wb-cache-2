5|$|During February 2009, {{following}} on from {{a series}} of extended discussions with the British National Space Centre (which later became the UK Space Agency), it was announced that a major funding agreement had been established between the British National Space Centre, ESA and REL, committing €1million ($1.28million) for the purpose of producing a demonstration engine for the Skylon programme by 2011. The initiative, known as the Technology <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Programme,</b> was scheduled to last approximately 2.5years, during which further financing in the form of €1million was made available by the ESA. The 2009 agreement allowed REL to involve several external companies, including EADS-owned Astrium, the University of Bristol and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in further development work. As a consequence of the enactment of the Technology <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Programme,</b> REL was able to transition from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2/3 up to 4/5 within a matter of months.|$|E

This was the largest scale application of this technology in the world. In this process, natural gas is injected into the boiler. This cut NOx emissions from Unit 2 by 50%, as well as giving a reduction in CO2 and SO2 emissions. In 1996, all the station's boilers were fitted with Low NOx burners. This reduced the station's NOx emissions by 40%.|$|E

25|$|The 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference 1991, {{organised}} by the EUCC and the Dutch government, {{marked the}} start of the development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a policy approach in the European Community. It led to the EC <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Programme</b> for ICZM and to the adoption of the European Council and Parliament Recommendation on ICZM (2002). EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; Dr. Alan Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this expert group until August 2013. As a result, a novel means for Member States to measure the progress they are making on ICZM implementation through the use of indicators was developed. This method was presented to the Working Group on Indicators and data and accepted by the Group of Experts in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|When the Maastricht Treaty {{established}} the European Union under its current name in 1993, the organization started identifying problems of misinterpretations of its name and resolved {{to change it}} to EUCC – The Coastal Union in 2001. During these years the main field of work was the promotion of integrated coastal zone management in Europe, contributing to the EC <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Programme</b> on ICZM [...] (1996-1999). EUCC participated in the UNEP ICZM Conference of 1998 in St Petersburg [...] which recommended a <b>demonstration</b> <b>programme</b> to be launched on ICZM for Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. EUCC took the lead to organise in conjunction with UNEP’s PAP/RAC, the first intergovernmental ICZM meeting (ICMCEENIS), in Croatia in June 2000, bringing together representatives from 18 non EU coastal States and from the Regional Seas Programmes for the Eastern Mediterranean, Baltic, Caspian and Black Seas who expressed support common ICZM initiatives for their regions. This role was boosted by {{the adoption of the}} European Commission Recommendation on ICZM in 2002 [...] when EUCC entered the EU ICZM Expert Group [...] and the Working Group on Indicators and Data, and was assigned the elaboration of an indicator-based methodology to measure progress on ICZM implementation. A milestone of this period is the contribution to the EC DG ENV commissioned study EUROSION which resulted on recommendations on how to manage coastal erosion in Europe in a sustainable way. EUCC had a mayor role {{on the development of the}} policy recommendations [...] and the publication of the study results.|$|E

In one of the experiments, targeted towards a broad group of UI receivers, arranged job-search activities in groups combined with increased monitoring of job-search efforts generated a 46 per cent increase in the escape rate between referral to and start of the programme services.

40|$|The {{protection}} of the earth's atmosphere requires substantial efforts to reduce CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. In order to meet these targets, governments have started to implement climate policies which include informational measures such as <b>demonstration</b> <b>programmes</b> {{as well as economic}} instruments such as energy or emission taxes, emission trading schemes, efficiency standards and labelling systems for appliances, and subsidies for low- or no-carbon technologies such as renewable energy sources. This book presents a highly policy-relevant overview of the likely macroeconomic effects of climate change policy. It portrays the current debate and analyses the modelling results of existing studies. The authors also present their own empirical results which contribute to closing the gap with regard to structural effects and impacts on technological change of climate change policies...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{energy-related}} CO 2 {{emissions are}} higher than ever. With new fossil-fuel power plants, growing energy-intensive industries and new sources of fossil fuels in development, further emissions increase seems inevitable. The rapid application of {{carbon capture and storage}} is a much heralded means to tackle emissions from both existing and future sources. However, despite extensive and successful research and development, progress in deploying carbon capture and storage has stalled. No fossil-fuel power plants, the greatest source of CO 2 emissions, are using carbon capture and storage, and publicly supported <b>demonstration</b> <b>programmes</b> are struggling to deliver actual projects. Yet, carbon capture and storage remains a core component of national and global emissions-reduction scenarios. Governments have to either increase commitment to carbon capture and storage through much more active market support and emissions regulation, or accept its failure and recognize that continued expansion of power generation from burning fossil fuels is a severe threat to attaining objectives in mitigating climate change...|$|R

50|$|The Future Rapid Effects System (FRES) was a name {{given to}} a UK {{programme}} to deliver a fleet of some 4000 vehicles to the British Army. Intended to be a mix of platform capabilities ranging from an Ambulance to a reconnaissance vehicle, {{with the need to}} be rapidly deployed into a variety of operational scenarios a modular scalable approach to the platform systems was essential. In 2005, the UK MOD contracted two parallel Technology <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Programmes</b> (TDPs), whose aim was produce an Electronic Architecture that was modular and scalable enough to fit all of the envisaged FRES fleet of vehicles. The two teams, led by BAES and Lockheed Martin, produced and demonstrated two independent Electronic Architecture solutions that were shown to meet the intent of the VSI standards & guidelines. The FRES programme has since been restructured; however aspects of the FRES EA TDP architectures {{are to be found in}} the current GVA Defence standard.|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} of providing electricity to rural households are manifold.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer and}} other human papillomavirus- (HPV-) related cancers are preventable, but {{preventive}} measures implemented in developing countries and especially in low-income rural regions have not been effective. Cervical cancer burden derived from sexually transmitted HPV infections is the heaviest in developing countries, and {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of cervical cancer cases is predicted, if no intervention is implemented in the near future. HPV vaccines offer an efficient way to prevent related cancers. Recently implemented school-based HPV vaccination <b>demonstration</b> <b>programmes</b> can help tackle the challenges linked with vaccine coverage, and access to vaccination and health services, but prevention strategies need to be modified according to regional characteristics. In urban regions WHO-recommended vaccination strategies might be enough to significantly reduce HPV-related disease burden, but in the rural regions additional vaccination strategies, vaccinating both sexes rather than only females when school attendance is the highest and applying a two-dose regime, need to be considered. From the point of view of both public health and ethics identification of the most effective prevention strategies is pivotal, especially when access to health services is limited. Considering cost-effectiveness versus justice further research on optional vaccination strategies is warranted...|$|R
