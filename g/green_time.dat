30|$|The above {{discussion}} {{makes clear}} that there is no unique and straightforward way towards a TUC-coordinated actuated control scheme, hence several alternative configurations, each carrying both benefits and shortcomings, which need to be carefully studied. As a basis for alternative configurations, the hybrid-TUC version is used. The <b>green</b> <b>times</b> decided by TUC are used as maximum <b>green</b> <b>times</b> for the actuated stages, while for minimum <b>green</b> <b>times,</b> the minimum <b>green</b> <b>times</b> also considered in TUC can be used. Note that stage skipping is not considered here, although it is an option worth to investigate in the future.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposal of novel signal design problem at isolated intersections, which {{assumes that the}} effective <b>green</b> <b>times</b> assigned to each signal phase follow dynamic user optimal (DUO) principle. At the DUO state, the average delays of vehicles using the signal phases with positive additional <b>green</b> <b>times</b> (the assigned effective <b>green</b> <b>times</b> minus the minimum effective <b>green</b> <b>times)</b> are equal and maximum. The proposed signal design problem is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem. The point queue (PQ) model is applied to represent traffic dynamics and to generate the cumulative traffic flows, which is further used to estimate the average delay of each signal phase. The existence of {{the solution of the}} proposed VI problem is proved and a solution algorithm based on the method of successive averages (MSA) is developed to solve the proposed signal design problem. Finally, a sample intersection is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model and the solution algorithm...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} {{model for the}} intersection of two urban streets. The traffic state at the crossroads is controlled {{by a set of}} traffic lights, which periodically switch to red and green with a total period of T. Vehicular dynamics is simulated and total delay experienced by the traffic is evaluated within a definite time interval. Minimizing the delay give rises to the optimum signalization of traffic lights. It is shown that two different phases are identified. In the light traffic phase, the <b>green</b> <b>times</b> should be distributed to the streets on an equal basis. In the congested phase, minimizing the delay enforces us to break the symmetry between the roads by allocating the majority of <b>green</b> <b>times</b> to one of the roads. In contrast to our common sense, dividing the <b>green</b> <b>times</b> on an equal basis, leads to unfairness to drivers. Comment: revtex, seven pages including 9 eps figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Fuzzy Logic Signal Controller for 4 -leg intersection, {{representing}} the {{urban road network}} is designed for this study. The input information of Fuzzy Signal Controller for each approaches in the intersection are the average saturation degree of flow that evaluated from microscopic flow data of the through. The microscopic flow data are measured by detectors located on {{the middle of the}} lines. These data are the information of <b>green</b> <b>times</b> for each signal plan. This controller evaluates the average saturation degree of each flow on the legs then calculates and decides the next <b>green</b> <b>times</b> after the previous <b>green</b> <b>times</b> for each cycle. After that signal times become more familiar with the dynamic of intersection flows. Finally, the performance developments by new Fuzzy Signal Controller are tested with VISSIM simulation space at the 4 -leg intersection. Test results shows that there is an improvement about capacity usage and average delay times, when it is compared with the fixed time signal control systems...|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{signal timing}} is the {{technique}} which traffic engineers use to distribute right-of-way at a signalized intersection. Traffic signal timing involves deciding how much <b>green</b> <b>time</b> the traffic signal provides to an intersection approach, {{how long the}} pedestrian WALK signal should be, and numerous other factors.|$|E
50|$|Gap, extension, or {{passage time}} determines the {{extendable}} {{portion of the}} <b>green</b> <b>time</b> for a movement.

30|$|In case of {{configuration}} B, {{the high}} traffic loads {{in combination with}} the fact that the main TUC stages are (even with increased minimum <b>green</b> <b>times)</b> actuated and at the same time do not benefit from any unused <b>green</b> <b>times,</b> create negative effects for the traffic conditions all over the network. That is, after all, why control configuration case B presents the worst performance from all other considered coordinated actuated control cases in all considered demand scenarios. Its performance is even worse than TUC in all but demand scenario 2, where actuation indicates some, though very small, improvement.|$|R

5000|$|Cyclists in some {{countries}} are also given separate rules and light phases at traffic signals and cyclist-specific traffic lights. For instance, in Germany and elsewhere at junctions with segregated facilities all the traffic in a given direction (motorists, pedestrians and cyclists) may get a green signal at the same time. [...] Turning motor traffic is obliged to wait for cyclists and pedestrians to clear the junction before proceeding. In this situation all the transport modes get equal <b>green</b> <b>time.</b> In contrast, UK and Irish practice restricts pedestrians to a dedicated signal phase, separate from and usually much shorter than the green phase for motorists (e.g. 6-12 seconds, vs. signal cycle times of up to 120 seconds). [...] If cyclists were to be segregated and treated {{in a similar manner}} this would imply a significant reduction in <b>green</b> <b>time</b> for cycle traffic at every junction. In the English city of Cambridge the use of cyclist-specific traffic signals is reported to have resulted in increased delays for cyclists, leading some to ignore the cycle-facilities and stay on the road. [...] A similar example occurred in a Parisian bikepath scheme in 1999. Cyclists faced twice the number of traffic signals as motorised traffic and were expected to wait over one minute to get seven seconds of <b>green</b> <b>time.</b> Conversely, in Copenhagen cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane have been linked to provide [...] "green waves" [...] for rush hour cycle-traffic, which time the lights so cyclists going an average speed {{are much more likely to}} encounter green lights on their trip.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} a major {{reduction}} in left-turn collisions and a minor reduction in merging and diverging collisions, due to the shifting of left turns outside the main intersection. In addition it reduces the number of different traffic light phases, significantly increasing traffic flow. Because separate phases are no longer needed for left turns, this increases <b>green</b> <b>time</b> for through traffic. The effect on turning traffic is mixed. Consequently, the timing of traffic signals along a highway featuring the design is made easier by the elimination of left-turn phases both on that highway and along intersecting roadways contributing to the reduction of travel times and the increased capacity of those roadways.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} basic {{traffic signal}} timing fundamentals, one must also understand the different {{modes of operation}} of the traffic signal controller which controls the signal. Traffic signals may be placed into two broad groups by their method of operation. They can be either pre-timed or actuated. Pre-timed traffic signals provide each intersection approach a fixed amount of time on a round robin basis, serving each approach consecutively, and repeating the pattern. No movements are skipped. An actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection. Where detection has occurred, <b>green</b> <b>time</b> is provided to that approach. Approaches with no detection are skipped. These two schemes are {{also referred to as}} interval based and phase based signal timing.|$|E

5000|$|The InSync {{processor}} is {{a modern}} state machine, which means it can dynamically choose which traffic phases to serve and instantly adjust and coordinate service and <b>green</b> <b>time</b> at each intersection’s phase. InSync outperforms predetermined signal timing plans which usually estimate traffic demand based on a small historical sampling and generalize those results across years of traffic signalization. InSync relies on detectors and artificial intelligence to move traffic efficiently. In effect, InSync makes decisions as a traffic engineer would: accepting inputs of actual traffic demand, determining phase priority based on occupancy and delay, and anticipating and coordinating traffic along the entire corridor. This complex decision-making process happens instantly, constantly and in real-time, as the system adapts moment by moment to actual demands on the road. Rather than changing signalization in future cycles or [...] "cycle by cycle," [...] InSync's adaptability to demand happens intra-phase; even the current phase being served is lengthened or shortened based on {{the presence or absence}} of vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Optimising {{traffic signal}} timings for a multiple-junction road network is a {{difficult}} but important problem. The essential dif-ficulty of this {{problem is that the}} traffic signals need to co-ordinate their behaviours to achieve the common goal of op-timising overall network delay. This paper discusses a novel approach towards the generation of optimal signalling strate-gies, based on the use of a genetic algorithm (GA). This GA optimises the set of signal timings for all junctions in network. The different efficient red and <b>green</b> <b>times</b> for all the signals are determined by genetic algorithm as well as the offset time for each junction. Previous attempts to do this rely on a fixed cycle time, whereas the algorithm described here attempts to opti-mise cycle time for each junction as well as proportion of <b>green</b> <b>times.</b> The fitness function {{is a measure of the}} overall delay of the network. The resulting optimised signalling strategies were compared against a well-known civil engineering technique, and conclusions drawn. ...|$|R
