40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the responses by stream macroinvertebrates to habitat drying is needed as the pressure put on freshwater resources and hydrological regimes through land-use change, groundwater takes, and irrigation increases. To further understand the influences of abiotic and biotic factors on macroinvertebrate emergence, development, and mortality during habitat drying, I designed a field study and a mesocosm experiment. Three distinct drying regimes were measured in scour pools in the Selwyn River, Canterbury, New Zealand, over the austral summer of 2008 / 09. Pool hydroperiod (time from pool disconnection to drying) restricted the number of macroinvertebrate individuals that escaped desiccation. Fast, flexible development and multiple generations per year were more important invertebrate life history traits than metamorphosis type, with the highest <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> found in Diptera, and very low <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> in Trichoptera, both of which undergo complex metamorphosis. <b>Emergence</b> <b>rates</b> of Ephemeroptera, which undergoes less complex metamorphosis, decreased as water levels declined, indicating time restrictions were too great for a response to rapid drying. To further study the responses of macroinvertebrates with differing life history development (Deleatidium spp., hemimetabolous life history, and Olinga feredayi, holometabolous life history) to biotic and abiotic factors occurring during habitat drying, responses of macroinvertebrates to the three drying speeds, in the presence and absence of predator cues, were assessed in a mesocosm experiment. Total emergence of Deleatidium spp. was highest in slow-dry mesocosms with scent cues from predatory bullies present, and a three-way interaction was present between flow treatment, predator treatment, and time, in daily Deleatidium spp. <b>emergence</b> <b>rates.</b> Olinga feredayi had no emergence in any treatment but their survival was highest, possibly due to a trade-off between predation resistance and flexible life history. Thus responses by macroinvertebrates were highest in the highest risk situation, and were dependent on lifecycle type allowing rapid development in a highly time constrained habitat...|$|R

50|$|Jointed goatgrass is {{a winter}} annual grass seed native to Southern Europe and Russia, however {{currently}} {{there are at}} least 23 species distributed worldwide. It is considered a problem weed in United States, where it is now widely spread across western and central regions. It entered the US at several different times and at different locations, however the first was possibly in the late 19th century when Mennonite settlers from Russia brought Turkey winter wheat to Kansas. The first sample of jointed goatgrass was collected in Centerville, DE in 1870 and later samples collected in 1910 showed that jointed goatgrass had escaped from experimental plots on South Dakota State University campus at Brookings, SD.In 1999, it was reported that jointed goatgrass had infested an estimated 2 million hectares in the US alone, and that this was annually increasing {{at a rate of about}} 20 000 hectares. In 1986, jointed goatgrass had been reported as having infected less than 1% of winter wheat fields in seven counties in Nebraska, yet it was rated one of the ten most troublesome weeds, concerning 13% of respondents to a 1984 farmer survey.Human activities, wind, and machinery help to spread jointed goatgrass seeds once the joints disarticulate. However, due to the size of joints, wind dispersal is not as effective at spreading jointed goatgrass. Some of the human activities that helped spread jointed goatgrass include; planting contaminated wheat, allowing joints to blow from passing trucks hauling grain, transporting combines to different fields, or using straw spreaders on combines. Steven Miller argued that some states did not have laws that prevented contaminated winter wheat from being certified, which helped lead to it still being planted. Combines with straw spreaders are likely to spread jointed goatgrass joints farther than combines without these spreaders. Also, because the joints can float, runoff from fields can take them into rivers where they can aggregate and create an infestation in moist depressions, draws in fields, or along drainageways. It has been observed by growers and researchers that jointed goatgrass has a higher germination and <b>emergence</b> <b>rate</b> in compacted soils (such as in the wheel tracts of tractors) than in looser soils.|$|E

This study investigates the impact of the native braconid parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae on European populations of the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis. The parasitoid attacked adults and fourth instars of the ladybird more frequently than pupae and third instars. When given a choice, D. coccinellae attacked non-melanic adults and adults of a long term laboratory population of H. axyridis more often than melanic adults and adults of a field population, respectively. However, in no choice tests the parasitoid attacked individuals of either morph type and of the field and laboratory populations with the same frequency. Immature development of D. coccinellae took longer at lower temperatures and when less advanced developmental host stages (larvae and pupae) were successfully parasitized.

The alfalfa leaf-cutting bee, Megachile rotundata, develops in brood cells inside natural cavities, and may be exposed to hypoxic conditions for extended periods of time. Whether M. rotundata is tolerant of hypoxia, and whether exposure results in sub-lethal effects, has never been investigated. Overwintering M. rotundata prepupae were exposed to 10 %, 13 %, 17 %, 21 % and 24 % O 2 for 11 months. Once adults emerged, five indicators of quality — emergence weight, body size, feeding activity, flight performance, and adult longevity, — were measured to determine whether adult bees that survived past exposure to hypoxia were competent pollinators. M. rotundata prepupae are tolerant of hypoxic condition and have higher survival rates in hypoxia, than in normoxia. Under hypoxia, adult <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> did not decrease over the 11 months of the experiment. In contrast, bees reared in normoxia had decreased <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> by 8 months, and were dead by 11 months.

In this study, we considered a cereal aphid-parasitoid system and investigated (1) the host-parasitoid community structure, host availability, and parasitism rate in winter, (2) the influence of host quality in terms of species and instars on the fitness of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani-Perez (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), and (3) {{whether there is a}} detectable impact of host fidelity on parasitism success of this parasitoid species. Host density was low during winter and the aphid community consisted of the species Rhopalosiphum padi L. and Sitobion avenae Fabricius (both Hemiptera: Aphididae), both parasitized by A. rhopalosiphi at non-negligible rates. Aphidius rhopalosiphi produced more offspring when parasitizing R. padi compared with S. avenae, whereas bigger offspring were produced when parasitizing S. avenae. Although aphid adults and old larvae were significantly larger hosts than young larvae, the latter resulted in higher <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> and larger parasitoids. No impact of host fidelity on <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> or offspring size was detected. This study provides some evidence that winter A. rhopalosiphi populations are {{able to take advantage of}} an array of host types that vary in profitability, indicating that host selectivity may drop under winter's unfavourable conditions...|$|R
40|$|Winter radio-tracking {{of three}} African {{goshawks}} Accipiter tachiro showed that they each occupied well-wooded home ranges {{of at least}} 28 hectares. They perched and roosted mainly within densely foliaged trees and an adult female changed perches on &# 13; average 4, 7 times per hour. No crepuscular predation of bats was recorded, in contrast to regular summer predation on colonies of little free-tailed bats, Tadarida pumila, but winter <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> of these bats at dusk had dropped to < 5 of the previous summer. We predict that many accipiters will be regular predators of bats and that skewed sex ratios and high fecundity may be two means by which bats counter this predation...|$|R
40|$|Prairie restorations are {{expensive}} and <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> {{as low as}} ten percent are often observed. This could be because seeds are exposed to dangers from microbial and fungal attack, as well as predation from granivores after planting. Our experiment aimed to determine the post-dispersal seed fates of four native prairie species after they had been planted in the soil and covered with an exclosure to limit vertebrate predation. It was performed in a prairie restoration on the University of Northern Iowa Campus in Cedar Falls, Iowa. I coated five sets of 100 seeds of each species (Elymus canadensis, Oligoneuron rigidum, Eryngium yuccifolium, and Desmodium canadense) with fluorescent Glogerm™ and planted them {{at a depth of}} five millimeters in four rows (one row of 100 seeds per species, per exclosure) inside five wire mesh exclosures. After five weeks, seedling emergence data was collected and the top layer of soil from each row was excavated from within the exclosures. Collected soil was examined under a UV lamp and recovered seeds were tested for viability. I hypothesized {{that a majority of the}} seeds planted would be recovered, and that most of those recovered would be viable. Seed fates differed among the four species and were identified as emerged in the field, died during emergence, viable, and non-viable. Only 10 - 27 % of the seeds planted were accounted for after the first recovery date and 4 - 10 % after the second, and the majority tested were non-viable. Out of those recovered, 39 % emerged as seedlings with D. canadense and E. canadensis demonstrating the highest <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> of the four species. It is evident that finding seeds after planting is still an obstacle that must be overcome in order to better understand post-dispersal seed fates...|$|R

As the number of females increased, {{a decrease in the}} female average parasitism was demonstrated by a negative linear regression. However, the parasitism difference was only found to be significant (p<O. 05) between me population with only one female per egg card (± 200 host eggs) and the populations with {{three and four}} females per egg card.

40|$|Effects of {{neem oil}} on mating and {{oviposition}} behaviour of C. chinensis grown on azuki bean under laboratory conditions were studied. Mating frequency, copulation duration, fecundity and survivorship {{of the next}} generation progenies were significantly decreased by neem oil. Mating frequency was always found to be lower in the oil-treated pair than in the control pair, but it was increased with time after the oil application. A lower mating frequency and shorter copulation duration results in lower fecundity and lower <b>emergence</b> <b>rate.</b> Fecundity and <b>emergence</b> <b>rate</b> were always lower in oil-treated conditions. The effects of neem oil were always greater on male-treated pairs than on female-treated pairs...|$|E
30|$|To {{compare the}} leaf <b>emergence</b> <b>rate</b> between the z 3 mutant and the wild-type, the plants were grown in long-day {{conditions}} (14.5  h-light, 30  °C/ 9.5  h-dark, 24  °C) with 60 % relative humidity. The light source was light-emitting diodes producing mixed red, green, and blue light, and photon flux density was about 300  μmol m− 2  s− 1. Leaf <b>emergence</b> <b>rate</b> was estimated as previously described (Itoh et al. 1998). Briefly, when each new leaf blade had completely {{emerged from the}} sheath of the previous leaf, the number of leaves on the main culm was counted for each plant. Heading date (or flowering time) was recorded from sowing to emergence of the first panicle in the main culm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Native grasslands in the Campos de Cima da Serra, Brazil, {{are being}} {{converted}} at speed for exotic tree plantations and cropland. The impact of modified and novel soil {{conditions on the}} establishment of native grassland species is unknown; establishment of non-native species, deliberately or accidentally introduced, could be favoured. In a common garden composed of fully randomized replicate samples of soils collected from remnant grassland, former cropland and pine plantations, we tested emergence and establishment of five cold-season species: Native low-tussock grass Piptochaetium montevidense (Spreng.) Parodi; native legume Trifolium riograndense Burkart; naturalized low-tussock grass Vulpia bromoides (L.) Gray; low-tussock grass Holcus lanatus L., cultivated and naturalized in Brazil; and a cultivar of non-native Trifolium repens. Other than expected, soil type and species*soil type interactions had no significant effect on seedling emergence after 132 days in the field. Species effect on seedling emergence, however, was highly significant. Vulpia bromoides emergence was significantly highest in all soil types. Holcus lanatus and Trifolium riograndense both achieved second highest <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> and {{did not differ significantly}} from each other. Lowest overall <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> were found in the non-native clover cultivar. Lab germination tests failed for Piptochaetium, although it showed reasonable emergence in the field. Good performance of the native clover is encouraging for future grassland restoration, but the value of highly germinable Vulpia as a forage remains to be tested. Holcus tolerates a wide range of soil conditions and its life history traits may promote naturalization, or even invasiveness. Native grasslands of the region should be monitored for this species. Studies like these, but set up on a larger geographical scale and with a wider array of native species, will be essential in developing ecological restoration methods for southern Brazilian grasslands...|$|R
40|$|A temperature-dependent, two-component model, {{based on}} constant-temperature {{development}} data, was formulated which described {{the emergence of}} overwintered sorghum midges, Contarinia sorghicola (Coquillett) in the field. The first model component used a poikilotherm rate equation to predict <b>emergence</b> <b>rates</b> {{as a function of}} temperature. The second component distributed emerging adults over normalized time using a temperature- independent cumulative Weibull distribution. When coupled, components formed a temperature-dependent simulation model which described the spring emergence of overwintered midges from 1979 to 1982. The model tended to predict emergence before it actually occurred in the field. This discrepancy was corrected by incorporating a 1. 27 -cm precipitation delay factor which modified predicted rates to reflect the retarding effects of rainfall on daily emergence. Once precipitation delay was incorporated, the model very accurately predicted adult emergence during all 4 years...|$|R
