40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis we {{investigate}} the automorphism groups of regular trees. In the second part we look at the action of the automorphism group of a locally finite graph on the ends of the graph. The two part are not directly related but trees play a fundamental role in both parts. Let T n be the regular tree of valency n. Put G := Aut(T n) and let G 0 be the subgroup of G that is generated by the stabilisers of points. The main results of {{the first part}} are : Theorem 4. 1 Suppose 3 ≤ n N 0 and α ϵ T n. Then G α (the stabiliser of α in G) contains 2 2 N 0 subgroups of index less than 2 2 N 0. Theorem 4. 2 Suppose 3 ≤ n N 0 and <b>H</b> ≤ <b>G</b> with <b>G</b> : <b>H</b> | N 0. Then <b>H</b> = <b>G</b> <b>or</b> <b>H</b> = <b>G</b> 0 <b>or</b> <b>H</b> fixes a point <b>or</b> <b>H</b> stabilises an edge. Theorem 4. 3 Let n = N 0 and <b>H</b> ≤ <b>G</b> with | <b>G</b> : <b>H</b> | N 0. Then <b>H</b> = <b>G</b> <b>or</b> <b>H</b> = <b>G</b> 0 <b>or</b> there is a finite subtree ϕ of T n such that <b>G</b> (ϕ) ≤ <b>H</b> ≤ <b>G</b> { ϕ }. These are proved by finding a concrete description of the stabilisers of points in G, using wreath products, and also by making use of methods and results of Dixon, Neumann and Thomas [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 18, 580 - 586]. It is also shown how one is able to get short proofs of three earlier results about the automorphism groups of regular trees by using the methods used to prove these theorems. In their book Groups acting on graphs, Warren Dicks and M. J. Dunwoody [Cambridge University Press, 1989] developed a powerful technique to construct trees from graphs. An end of a graph is an equivalence class of half-lines in the graph, with two half-lines, L 1 and L 2, being equivalent if and only if we can find the third half-line that contains infinitely many vertices of both L 1 and L 2. In the second part we point out how one can, by using this technique, reduce questions about ends of graphs to questions about trees. This allows us both to prove several new results and also to give simple proofs of some known results concerning fixed points of group actions on the ends of a locally finite graph (see Chapter 10). An example of a new result is the classification of locally finite graphs with infinitely many ends, whose automorphism group acts transitively on the set of ends (Theorem 11. 1). </p...|$|R
40|$|The vertex-deleted {{subgraph}} G−v, {{obtained from}} the graph G by deleting the vertex v and all edges incident to v, is called a card of G. The deck of G is the multiset of its unlabelled vertex-deleted subgraphs. The number of common cards of <b>G</b> and <b>H</b> (<b>or</b> between <b>G</b> and <b>H)</b> is the cardinality of the multiset intersection of the decks of <b>G</b> and <b>H.</b> In this article, we present infinite families of pairs of graphs of order n ≥ 4 that have at least equation image common cards; we conjecture that these, along with {{a small number of}} other families constructed from them, are the only pairs of graphs having this many common cards, for sufficiently large n. This leads us to propose a new stronger version of the Reconstruction Conjecture. In addition, we present an infinite family of pairs of graphs with the same degree sequence that have equation image common cards, for appropriate values of n, from which we can construct pairs having slightly fewer common cards for all other values of n≥ 10. We also present infinite families of pairs of forests and pairs of trees with equation image and equation image common cards, respectively. We then present new families that have the maximum number of common cards when one graph is connected and the other disconnected. Finally, we present a family with a large number of common cards, where one graph is a tree and the other unicyclic, and discuss how many cards are required to determine whether a graph is a tree...|$|R

In most paramyxoviruses, two viral membrane glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and receptor binding protein (HN, <b>H</b> <b>or</b> <b>G)</b> mediate a concerted process of recognition of host cell surface molecules followed by fusion of viral and cellular membranes, resulting in viral nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. The interactions between the F and HN, <b>H</b> <b>or</b> <b>G</b> viral glycoproteins and host molecules are critical in determining host range, virulence and spread of these viruses. Recently, atomic structures, together with biochemical and biophysical studies, have provided major insights into how these two viral glycoproteins successfully interact with host receptors on cellular membranes and initiate the membrane fusion process to gain entry into cells. These studies highlight the conserved core mechanisms of paramyxovirus entry that provide the fundamental basis for rational anti-viral drug design and vaccine development...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives {{explicit}} {{results for}} the infinite Gibbs partitions generated by the jumps of an α−stable subordinator, derived in Pitman (39; 38). We first show that for general α the conditional EPPF can be represented as ratios of Fox-H functions, {{and in the case}} of rational α, Meijer-G functions. This extends {{results for the}} known case of α = 1 / 2, which can be expressed in terms of Hermite functions, hence answering an open question. Furthermore the results show that the resulting unconditional EPPF’s, can be expressed in terms of <b>H</b> and <b>G</b> transforms indexed by a function h. Hence when h is itself a <b>H</b> <b>or</b> <b>G</b> function the EPPF is also an <b>H</b> <b>or</b> <b>G</b> function. An implication, in the case of rational α, is that one can compute explicitly thousands of EPPF’s derived from possibly exotic special functions. This would also apply to all α except that computations for general Fox functions are not yet available. However, moving away from special functions, we demonstrate how results from probability theory may be used to obtain calculations. We show that a forward recursion can b...|$|R

40|$|To infect a cell, the Paramyxoviridae {{family of}} enveloped viruses {{relies on the}} coordinated action of a receptor-binding protein (variably HN, <b>H,</b> <b>or</b> <b>G)</b> and a more conserved {{metastable}} fusion protein (F) to effect membrane fusion and allow genomic transfer. Upon receptor binding, HN (<b>H</b> <b>or</b> <b>G)</b> triggers F to undergo an extensive refolding event to form a stable postfusion state. Little {{is known about the}} intermediate states of the F refolding process. Here, a soluble form of parainfluenza virus 5 F was triggered to refold using temperature and was footprinted along the refolding pathway using fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP). Localization of the oxidative label to solvent-exposed side chains was determined by high-resolution MS/MS. Globally, metastable prefusion F is oxidized more extensively than postfusion F, indicating that the prefusion state is more exposed to solvent and is more flexible. Among the first peptides to be oxidatively labeled after temperature-induced triggering is the hydrophobic fusion peptide. A comparison of peptide oxidation levels with the values of solvent-accessible surface area calculated from molecular dynamics simulations of available structural data reveals regions of the F protein that {{lie at the heart of}} its prefusion metastability. The strong correlation between the regions of F that experience greater-than-expected oxidative labeling and epitopes for neutralizing antibodies suggests that FPOP has a role in guiding the development of targeted therapeutics. Analysis of the residue levels of labeled F intermediates provides detailed insights into the mechanics of this critical refolding event...|$|R
