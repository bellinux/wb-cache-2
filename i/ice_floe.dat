Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an <b>ice</b> <b>floe.</b> On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E

5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, a blade of the {{propeller}} of the Island was damaged in a collision with an <b>ice</b> <b>floe.</b> When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been put in their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small <b>ice</b> <b>floe.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Campine Plateau {{in northeastern}} Belgium, {{a remnant of}} an {{alluvial}} fan deposited by the Meuse River during the mid-Pleistocene, is characterised {{by the presence of}} boulders with maximum dimensions of up to 2 m, embedded in a gravel matrix. These boulders originated in the Ardennes region and are generally assumed to have been transported by ice-rafting processes. This paper investigates for the first time quantitatively the possibility of purely hydraulic transport of the boulders, taking into account channel and flow characteristics in the boulder provenance area during the mid-Pleistocene. Empirical transport relations that describe incipient motion thresholds in nonuniform river beds {{as a function of the}} relative grain size, or the ratio between the grain size of interest and the median grain size of the channel bed, are applied in order to calculate critical water depths for transport of boulders of various sizes. Results indicate that hydraulic transport of boulders with intermediate diameters < 1 m could have occurred within limited reaches of the palaeoriver, more specifically in the palaeo-Amblève tributary; whereas the small slope gradient of the palaeo-Meuse most probably inhibited boulder movement by hydraulic forces only. Although calculations of the ice volume required to lift a boulder to the water surface and comparison of the <b>ice</b> <b>floe's</b> dimensions with palaeochannel morphology do suggest that ice rafting is theoretically possible, several alternative, more probable transport mechanisms for the larger boulders of the Campine Plateau are proposed, requiring much smaller critical ice volumes and water depths than ice-rafting processes or purely hydraulic transport. These hypotheses include decreased bed friction and effective boulder density caused by a limited ice layer attached to the river bed and the boulder, hence lowering hydraulic transport thresholds, as well as the formation of ice jams and dams inducing catastrophic flooding and mechanical impacts by ice floes upon failure. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|Sure enough, it was so. In one of {{the changes}} that are so unaccountable among the <b>ice,</b> the <b>floe</b> had taken a sudden and {{powerful}} direction towards the entrance of the Great Bay. It was probably owing to the circumstance that the inner field had forced its way past the cape, and made room for its neighbour to follow. A few of Daggett's people, with Daggett himself, remained to see what might yet be saved from the wreck; but {{all the rest of the}} men started for the cape, towards which the Oyster Pond craft was now directly setting. The distance was less than a league; and, as yet, there was not much show on the rocks.

40|$|Austral summer sea-ice {{processes}} {{were investigated}} in January 1999 during a cruise of the R. V. Nathaniel B. Palmer {{in the central}} and eastern Ross Sea, Antarctica. The crystal texture, 18 O/ 16 O ratios, density and salinity of ice cores and of ice blocks 'perched' on slush at the ice surface were studied. The perched ice blocks had a distinctive polygonal granular (PG) crystal texture and very negative isotope signature that were also characteristic of layers {{at the top of}} first-year floes and of layers 'buried' below the surface in multi-year floes. The PG ice is superimposed ice that results from melting in the snow cover and refreezing at the slush surface and directly on top of ice floes. If PG ice is buried after the ice surface floods and the resultant slush freezes, then snow ice forms above the PG ice. The contribution of superimposed <b>ice</b> to <b>floe</b> surface mass balance and some implications with respect to weather and climate are discussed.

5000|$|Resolute set up {{her first}} winter camp, cutting a dock into the {{stationary}} land ice of Dealy Island near {{the north shore}} of Viscount Melville Sound. [...] During {{the spring and summer of}} 1853, the crews of Resolute and Intrepid sledged far and wide searching for clues to Franklin's whereabouts and to hopefully locate Investigator and Enterprise. They found neither Franklin or Enterprise, but did succeed in finding and rescuing Captain McClure and the officers and men of her crew in April 1853, upon their ice-bound ship, HMS Investigator. Captain Kellett ordered McClure to abandon Investigator because she had been and continued to be hopelessly frozen in ice since 1850, without any spring or summer thaw releasing her, and this had caused severe hardship for the men because they had been on reduced rations for over a year. Before winter set in, and while the ice was still open at Dealy Island, the 1852-53 winter camp was broken up, and Resolute and Intrepid sailed eastward. In August 1853, a cold front caused the open passage to freeze up, and Resolute became encased in the <b>floe</b> <b>ice.</b> Since the flow direction of the water, and therefore the ice, was from the west to the east, Resolute moved east at about 1.5 nautical miles per day. They prepared Resolute for the winter, stowing all her sails, and upper rigging below. Resolute was still beset by this <b>floe</b> <b>ice</b> in the spring of 1854. In April, Belcher ordered Captain Kellett to abandon Resolute. Only under protest did Kellett do so. He prepared the ship the way he would for winter: taking all her rigging down below except for the very lowest sections of the mast, shipping the rudder, and caulking all the hatches. In May, Captain Kellett left Resolute locked in the slowly moving <b>floe</b> <b>ice,</b> and led his men in a hard march across the ice to reach other ships of the expedition at Beechy Island. Their number included the officers and crew of Investigator who had been rescued by Kellett in the spring of 1853, and the men from Intrepid, as well as Resolute.|$|R

40|$|Stationkeeping in managed ice using dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) control {{system has been}} an area of great interest {{over the past few}} years. The stationkeeping performance of a DP vessel depends on the modelling accuracy of the ice forces, which in turn depends on managed <b>ice</b> field characteristics (<b>floe</b> size, floe thickness, inclusion of brash ice and small ice pieces, ice drift speed and direction) and DP system (gain set-ups). Over the years, many engineers have been using numerical and experimental tools to assess the effect of these parameters. More recently, a comprehensive series of experiments with a 1 / 40 scaled DP vessel were conducted in various realistic managed ice conditions in the ice tank facility of OCRE-NRC in early 2015. This paper describes the preparation of managed ice field, the procedure of the model tests and the methodologies of data analysis. The physical and mechanical characteristics of the ice field were modelled by controlling ice concentration, <b>ice</b> thickness, <b>floe</b> size, <b>ice</b> strength and ice drift speed/direction. The ice concentration ranged from light condition (6 / 10 th) to very heavy condition (9 / 10 th+) with three different floe sizes (100 m, 50 m and 25 m). Three different ice thicknesses (0. 6 m, 1. 2 m and 2 m) were used and three different drift speeds (0. 2 kts, 0. 5 kts, and 1. 2 kts) with various heading angles were tested. Some tests used high strength model ice {{in order to keep the}} ice field longer (sometimes for 2 nd day). Some tests used properly scaled model ice (700 kPa of flexural strength in full scale) in order to simulate ice failure appropriately.
