5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the <b>kiang,</b> Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{members who}} qualify to become NCMPs {{are allowed to}} reject their seats in Parliament. During the 2011 general election, several {{opposition}} leaders stated {{that they would not}} want to accept NCMP seats. Among them was Low Thia <b>Kiang,</b> the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore ("WP").|$|E
50|$|Their {{only real}} {{predator}} other than humans is the wolf. <b>Kiangs</b> defend themselves by forming a circle, and with heads down, kick out violently. As a result, wolves usually attack single animals that have strayed from the group.|$|R
50|$|The Indian {{wild dogs}} feed on small and larger herbivorous mammals such as chital, sambar, blackbucks, deer, wild boar, Asiatic water buffalo, nilgai and gaur. On few occasions, Ussuri dholes also hunt {{elephant}} calves {{and may also}} feed on onagers and <b>kiangs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Kiangs</b> {{are found}} on the Tibetan Plateau, between the Himalayas {{in the south and}} the Kunlun Mountains in the north. This restricts them almost entirely to China, but small numbers are found across the borders in the Ladakh and Sikkim regions of India, and along the {{northern}} frontier of Nepal.|$|R
5|$|Following the 2011 general election, a Cabinet {{reshuffle}} {{took place}} effective 21 May 2011. Lim Hng <b>Kiang</b> and Lim Swee Say respectively retained their Trade and Industry and Prime Minister's Office portfolios, while other ministers were given new appointments {{to the remaining}} 11 ministries. Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, both elected to Parliament for the first time, were respectively assigned the posts of Minister for Education, and Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.|$|E
5|$|Though {{populations have}} {{substantially}} decreased in western Africa, bohor reedbuck still exist in Niokolo-Koba National Park (Senegal); Corubal River (Guinea-Bissau); <b>Kiang</b> West National Park (Gambia); Arly-Singou and Nazinga Game Ranch (Burkina Faso). Larger numbers occur in {{eastern and central}} Africa, mostly in protected areas such as Bouba Ndjida (Cameroon); Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park (Central African Republic); Bale Mountains National Park (Ethiopia); Murchison Falls National Park and Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve (Uganda); Maasai Mara (Kenya); Serengeti National Park, Moyowosi-Kigosi and Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania).|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the <b>kiang</b> as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|Leg {{bars are}} {{prominent}} on Grevy's zebras and mountain zebras, and African wild asses also have well-defined black leg bars below the forearm and gaskin {{on a white}} or pale background. However, as in horses, expression of leg bars seems to vary widely among donkeys, plains zebras, and Przewalski's horses, while they appear very seldom {{or not at all}} in onagers and <b>kiangs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Kiangs</b> inhabit alpine {{meadows and}} steppe country between 2700 and 5300 m elevation. They prefer {{relatively}} flat plateaus, wide valleys, and low hills, dominated by grasses, sedges, and smaller amounts of other low-lying vegetation. This open terrain, {{in addition to}} supplying them with suitable forage absent in the more arid regions of central Asia, may {{make it easier for}} them to detect, and flee from, predators.|$|R
25|$|Animals such as yaks and dzos roam {{across the}} wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a {{decrease}} in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the Tibetan antelope, argali, <b>kiangs,</b> musk deer, and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. However, in the Lahaul valley, one can see ibex, brown bears, foxes and snow leopards during winter.|$|R
25|$|There {{are five}} {{subspecies}} of Asiatic wild ass or onager, Equus hemionus, and three subspecies of the <b>kiang,</b> Equus <b>kiang,</b> of the Himalayan upland.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, the Hospital <b>Kiang</b> Wu {{was founded}} as a {{traditional}} Chinese medical hospital. It was in 1892 that doctor Sun Yat-Sen brought Western medicine services to the hospital.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kiangs</b> {{sometimes}} gather {{together in}} large herds, which may number several hundred individuals. However, these herds are not permanent groupings, but temporary aggregations, consisting either of young males only, or {{of mothers and}} their foals. Older males are typically solitary, defending a territory of about 0.5 to 5 km2 from rivals, and dominating any local groups of females. Territorial males sometimes become aggressive towards intruders, kicking and biting at them, but more commonly chase them away after a threat display that involves flattening the ears and braying.|$|R
50|$|Like all equids, <b>kiangs</b> are herbivores, {{feeding on}} grasses and sedges, {{especially}} Stipa, but also including other local {{plants such as}} bog sedges, true sedges, and meadow grasses. When little grass is available, such as during winter or in the more arid margins of their native habitat, they have been observed eating shrubs, herbs, and even Oxytropis roots, dug from the ground. Although they do sometimes drink from waterholes, such sources of water are rare on the Tibetan Plateau, and they likely obtain most of their water from the plants they eat, or possibly from snow in winter.|$|R

East Africa displays cape buffalo, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild's giraffe,Grant's Gazelle,fringe-eared oryx, impala,Thomson's Gazelle,nile lechwe,waterbuck, and a lagoon with East African crowned cranes The North Africa exhibit represents the Sahel and Sahara that houses [...] scimitar-horned oryx, barbary stag, red-fronted gazelle, and Ankole-Watusi cattle. [...] The Southern Africa field exhibits Grévy's zebras. The Central Africa region features a wooded waterhole with an island for pink-backed pelicans, saddle-billed storks, and Rüppell's vultures. On {{the shores of}} the lake are bongo antelope, red river hogs,greater kudu,Vaal rheboks, and other forest animals. A number of smaller enclosures visible only from the tram are home to Somali wild ass, <b>kiangs</b> (one of the world's only captive populations of this endangered wild equine), Arabian oryx, gorals, Japanese serows, black rhinoceroses, and Przewalski's horses.|$|R
25|$|The {{latter two}} {{theories}} {{are the most}} likely and are together supported by multiple scientific studies. Clyde <b>Kiang</b> stated that the Hakkas' origins may also be linked with the Han's ancient neighbors, the Dongyi and Xiongnu people. However, this is disputed by many scholars and Kiang's theories are considered to be controversial.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kiang,</b> or Tibetan wild ass, {{is common}} in the grasslands of Changthang, {{numbering}} about 2,500 individuals. These animals are {{in conflict with the}} nomadic people of Changthang who hold the <b>Kiang</b> responsible for pasture degradation. There are about 200 snow leopards in Ladakh of an estimated 7,000 worldwide. The Hemis High Altitude National Park in central Ladakh is an especially good habitat for this predator as it has abundant prey populations. The Eurasian lynx, is another rare cat that preys on smaller herbivores in Ladakh. It is mostly found in Nubra, Changthang and Zangskar. The Pallas's cat, which looks somewhat like a house cat, is very rare in Ladakh and not much is known about the species. The Tibetan wolf, which sometimes preys on the livestock of the Ladakhis, is the most persecuted amongst the predators. There are also a few brown bears in the Suru valley and the area around Dras. The Tibetan sand fox has been discovered in this region. Among smaller animals, marmots, hares, and several types of pika and vole are common.|$|E
25|$|Macau {{is served}} by one major public hospital, the Hospital Conde S.

30|$|The Tso Kar and Tso Moriri {{are both}} {{proposed}} as protected areas within the ‘Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary’ and are of prime biodiversity importance. Hence, {{in areas where}} biodiversity conservation is also a societal priority, competition between wild and domestic herbivores becomes an important land and resource management issue in changing the natural resource use patterns of the domestic herbivores. Pasture use changes by Rupshus that have resulted in increased rangeland exploitation by livestock {{are likely to have}} significant consequences for wild herbivore populations, as has been seen {{in other areas of the}} trans-Himalayan belt, through both forage use overlap (Mishra et al. 2002, 2004; Bagchi et al. 2004) and interference competition (Raghavan 2003; Namgail et al. 2007 b). Pastoralists are becoming increasingly intolerant of wild herbivores that use the same pastures, for instance the <b>kiangs</b> are commonly being driven away from the pastures (Bhatnagar et al. 2006 a, b). The Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata), which historically occurred in the Tso Kar basin, became locally extinct during the 1980 s due to hunting pressure, but livestock grazing seems to have prevented its recovery (Bhatnagar et al. 2006 a).|$|R
25|$|On 30 September 2002, Lim Hng <b>Kiang</b> who {{was then}} the Second Minister for Finance, Minister for Health and the Deputy Chairman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, {{announced}} Singapore as the host of the annual meetings for 2006.

25|$|According to Lim Hng <b>Kiang,</b> Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry, ASEAN {{was already}} the seventh largest {{economy in the}} world, and the third largest in Asia in 2013, {{estimated}} at US$2.3 trillion. A recent study by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited has projected that five of the top fifteen manufacturing locations {{in the world will}} be in ASEAN by 2018. Furthermore, by 2050, ASEAN is also expected to be the fourth-largest economy in the world (after the European Union, the US, and China).|$|E
25|$|None of the Macau {{hospitals}} are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. There are no western-style medical schools in Macau, and thus all aspiring physicians in Macau have to obtain {{their education and}} qualification elsewhere. Local nurses are trained at the Macau Polytechnic Institute and the <b>Kiang</b> Wu Nursing College. Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau. A study by the University of Macau, commissioned by the Macau SAR government, concluded that Macau {{is too small to}} have its own medical specialist training centre.|$|E
25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the {{mountain}} zebra show a distinct dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most {{have a black}} dorsal stripe, though {{it can be difficult}} to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and <b>kiang</b> are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
25|$|Molecular phylogenies {{indicate}} {{the most recent}} common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) {{within the range of}} 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the kulan, onager, and <b>kiang),</b> followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Pleistocene horse fossils {{have been}} {{assigned}} to a multitude of species, with over 50 species of equines described from the Pleistocene of North America alone, although the taxonomic validity of most of these has been called into question. Recent genetic work on fossils has found evidence for only three genetically divergent equid lineages in Pleistocene North and South America. These results suggest all North American fossils of caballine-type horses (which also include the domesticated horse and Przewalski's horse of Europe and Asia), as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus) {{belong to the same}} species: E. ferus. Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, E. quinni and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to E. cf. hemiones, and E. (Asinus) cf. <b>kiang)</b> probably all belong to a second species endemic to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus E. (Asinus) (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to E. ferus. Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as Hippidion, originally believed to be descended from Pliohippus, was shown to be a third species in the genus Equus, closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse. The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary intraspecific plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds.|$|E

500|$|There are no {{permanent}} human {{settlements in the}} region, though it has {{a large number of}} defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or Dokpas [...] herd yak, sheep and pashmina-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including Tibetan gazelle, snow leopard, Tibetan wolf, Tibetan snowcock, lammergeier, raven, golden eagle, and ruddy shelduck. Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak, nayan, <b>kiang,</b> and Tibetan wolf.|$|E
500|$|Several media {{publications}} consider Stone {{one of her}} generation's {{most talented}} actresses.
