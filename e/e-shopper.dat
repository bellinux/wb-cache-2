The shopping assistant is developed based on value networks which extend Bayesian networks with user preference. On-line shopping of bicycles is used as the application domain. ...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the antecedents of trust including Company Reputation, Website Design, Service Quality, and Security and Privacy Policy in an online environment within the Pakistani context. A pre-tested questionnaire survey is used in order to collect the response of <b>e-shopper</b> in three cities, Abbottabad, Haripur and Islamabad, from 200 Pakistani e-shoppers. SPSS was {{used to analyze the}} data and three techniques descriptive statistics, regression analysis and correlation analysis are applied. Findings revealed a positive direct relationship between the independent and dependent variables which validate the earlier studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} examine the antecedents of online shopper excitement, its {{consequences}} for behavioural intentions as expressed by intent to return, and positive word-of-mouth communication. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual model is developed based on the literature. Instrument item scales to measure all constructs in the model were as informed by the literature and adapted from prior studies. An online structured questionnaire survey was sent by e-mail to a UK consumer panel (n= 626). The results were analysed using LISREL 8. 7. Findings – Convenience, involvement, attributes of the web site and merchandising all collectively influence shopper excitement. The attributes of the web site and merchandising directly influence intent to return. <b>E-shopper</b> excitement leads to positive word-of-mouth (WOM) and increases the intent to return. Research limitations/implications – The study may be limited in that no differentiation is made between the types of goods that e-consumers purchased. A future extension of this work could be to investigate how the study {{can be applied to}} various products, including experience goods such as entertainment. Practical implications – It is shown that shopping excitement can increase intent to return and positive WOM. Understanding online shopper excitement can explain some of the reasons why consumers shop online, which in turn can help e-tailers improve their offerings to their consumers. Originality/value – The study presents a comprehensive model of online shopper excitement. This is the first study to validate such a model empirically, and therefore the study adds {{to the understanding of the}} antecedents and consequences of consumer excitement in the online shopping environment...|$|E

The key objective is to identify the influences of <b>e-shoppers</b> purchase decision in e-shopping medium. Focus group discussions were conducted with consumers who were residing in the UK and have already had experience in shopping from the Internet. Focusing on the actual consumers' shopping experience and not their shopping intention, this approach gives more advantages in identifying consumers' drivers. The study found {{that most of the}} influences given by the respondents of using e-shopping are consistent with attributes suggested by Rogers' (1995) Diffusion of Innovation Theory. <b>E-shoppers</b> are becoming more price sensitive, while trust and strong brand name are gaining more attention from <b>e-shoppers.</b> The results explicitly clarified several key contributions and implications to marketing theory and practice...|$|R
40|$|Online {{shopping}} {{as a form}} {{of electronic}} commerce worldwide, has come to stay. While many studies have been authored on the motivation that drives the daily interactive transactions, the interplay between shoppers and vendors continues to increase in complexity, especially with the regular introduction of many advanced online services and features. Among the issues that have also increased the complexity are how different demographic profiles and geographic backgrounds impact online sales and customer retention. The interest in shopping online is motivated by a reduction in key barriers and the trust cultivated in an e-shop as compared to other alternatives. Against this background, this paper uses the a-priori Algorithm in Association rule mining to discover strong rules between variables of interest in a large dataset of <b>e-shoppers</b> in the Czech Republic. With a higher support and lift, the results reveal a high level of confidence between the reasons that propel the customer to start buying via the Internet, criteria for buying items on the Internet and the information gathered before the initiation of an online transaction. The paper further conducts a comparative analysis of shoppers' attitudes to foreign e-shops and local ones. In addition, the paper uses a clustering algorithm to segment demographic variables of respondents against the inclination of local Czech <b>e-shoppers</b> attitudes to foreign e-shops and their local shops. The results indicate that millennial Czech <b>e-shoppers</b> tend to patronize other foreign e-shops, especially female respondents, while adult <b>e-shoppers</b> are conservative when it comes to e-shopping. Finally, the paper proposes managerial recommendations for e-vendors in the Czech Republic on how best they can incorporate <b>e-shoppers</b> into their fold, given the notion that online shopping is here to stay. A total of 1, 602 shoppers in the Czech Republic responded to the questionnaire, generating the data forthe analysis...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the current}} hyper-competitive {{nature of the}} {{e-commerce}} marketplace, coupled with razor-thin margins, online personalization is {{of great interest to}} e-companies. The attractiveness of online personalization technologies derives from the claim by consumer behaviorists that a personalized experience leads to increased buy probabilities on the part of <b>e-shoppers</b> [11]. Virtually all personalization technologies are based on the idea of storing as much historical customer session data as possible, and then querying the data store as customers navigate through a web site. The holy grail of on-line personalization is an environment where fine-grained, detailed historical session data can be queried based on current online navigation patterns to formulate real-time responses.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{has become}} {{an important part of}} our consumer lives, and we increasingly choose to do more and more of our shopping online. Along with the growth of online sales, the number of e-commerce retailers has also increased. This has inevitably put additional demands on existing companies as well as new market entrants to ensure that their growth (if not just survival) as well as competitiveness are sustainable and evolving. Web personalisation has been adopted as a means to support business sustainability and competitiveness. It is now increasingly common and has been recognised by e-commerce businesses and consumers as a feature and functionality, expected to be offered as ‘standard’. Recent World Wide Web technology advances have greatly improved the way ecommerce websites are designed and deployed. However, the analysis of academic literature and professional practices shows that these advances are not used to their full potential. This research gap is an opportunity for this community to consider how techniques such as ontologies could be used to enhance personalisation of e-commerce websites. This thesis presents a novel approach to e-commerce website personalisation (PERSONTO), and in particular, personalisation of content presentation. Personalisation is achieved by means of an ontology-based <b>e-shopper</b> profiling. For this purpose, a reusable, extendible and Semantic Web compatible customer profiling ontology OntoProfi is designed and implemented. A ‘proof-of-concept’ prototype of PERSONTO confirmed the feasibility of the proposed approach. The analysis of achievements of the research objectives and outcomes showed that the approach is flexible, extendible and reusable, and that it was achieved by using systematic methods in the system design and implementation of the prototype. The evaluation of the acceptance of the proposed approach suggests there is a high level of acceptance of the approach by the prospective end users and e-commerce developers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis makes three contributions. Firstly, it {{presents}} online lock-in as a situation specific variable {{that has the}} potential to impact on site choice and switching intentions for planned and unplanned purchases. Secondly, this thesis introduces mindset as a consumer and situation specific characteristic and investigates its impact on online purchase intentions, both planned and unplanned. Thirdly, this thesis uses stockout as a situational ‘backdrop’ to investigate the independent and joint impacts of lock-in and mindset on consumer emotions and behaviours. •Background and proposed hypotheses: Conventional wisdom dictates that it is more profitable to retain existing customers than acquire new ones, a notion that also extends to the Internet as a shopping platform. Given the multitude of online retailers and the availability of thousands and thousands of choices at the e-buyer’s fingertips, retailers invest considerable effort in thriving for loyalty. Lock-in, as a type of skill based loyalty, can offer a point of differentiation to lure consumers into developing preference for a site in the hope of successfully retaining these consumers. While, as stated, this thesis measures the impact of lock-in on intention to choose and stay at the high lock-in site, of further interest, it takes into account the evolving nature of an <b>e-shopper</b> and introduces e-shopping experience as a moderator to the proposed relationships. Based on annotated discussions, the thesis proposes and tests the following hypotheses: H 1 (a) : Consumers who have had more opportunity to practice and learn to navigate and operate a site are more likely to return to the site for a final purchase decision. H 1 (b) : Consumers who have had more opportunity to practice and learn to navigate and operate a site are less likely to switch to a competing site. H 2 (a) : Experienced consumers are less likely than inexperienced consumers to purchase from a site they have recently learned to navigate and operate. H 2 (b) : Experienced consumers are more likely than inexperienced consumers to switch to the competing site. A significant portion of online purchase decisions is made during store visits, hence reflecting the unplanned nature of many purchases. However, {{there is a need to}} study the impact of high order variables on unplanned purchasing online. This thesis introduces mindset as a predominantly psychological concept which is used as a basis to model unplanned behavioural intentions. The proposition is that the task at hand dictates the type of mental state (deliberative or implemental) that consumers adopt prior to their site visits so that the nature of the mindset will incite actions that are congruent to the mindset formed at the onset of the visits. Discussions lead to the development of the following hypothesis: H 3 : The likelihood for unplanned purchasing will be higher for buyers who access a website in a deliberative than in an implemental mindset. When a chosen item is out-of-stock (OOS hereafter), a consumer usually seeks to make a tradeoff amongst many costs so as to reach the best decision, of either defecting from the store, switching brand/item, cancelling or postponing the purchase. We propose that the level of lock-in felt with a site and the mindset adopted at pre-visit stages, will redefine the instrumental and non-instrumental elements of the shopping task, to shape the level of perceived costs involved in the decision processes, and ultimately behavioural reactions. We test the independent and joint effects of mindset and lock-in on emotional and behavioural reactions through the following hypotheses: H 4 : Buyers in an implemental mindset are more likely to demonstrate stronger negative emotions than those in a deliberative mindset. H 5 : Buyers who are in an implemental mindset and experience an OOS at a low lock-in site are more likely to switch to a high lock-in site and look for an item than stay at a low lock-in site. H 6 : Consumers will experience stronger negative emotions if OOS occurs at a low than high lock-in site. H 7 : Buyers in an implemental mindset will experience stronger negative emotions if OOS occurs at a low than when it occurs at a high lock-site, while the emotions of buyers in a deliberative mindset will not differ between an OOS encountered at a low and a high lock-in site. H 8 : Buyers are more likely to switch from a low lock-in site than a high lock-in site when an OOS is encountered. H 9 : Buyers in an implemental mindset are more likely to switch to a high lock-in site than those in a deliberative mindset. •Methodology – the online experiment: To test the hypotheses, we convened an online experiment embedded with a series of tasks designed to manipulate both lock-in and mindset. Lock-in served as the within subject variable, manipulated as high and low, while mindset, the between subject variable, was either deliberative or implemental. Low lock-in and absence of the mindset manipulation served as control conditions. Respondents received an e-mail with one of 56 unique experimental links that were created to accommodate the conditions. The link introduced them to a hypothetical gift purchasing task in which they were requested to visit two Australian existing websites and make a few item selections. As part of the lock-in manipulations, respondents selected either two items (low lock-in) or six items (high lock-in) from the first site (site A), and typed the items’ descriptions/names into a specific answer box in the survey; these were automatically fed into the program to make a list of items. Pre-visit instructions for each site also contained mindset manipulations. Respondents then visited site B and again typed their selections to add to their lists of items, from which they were expected to make their final purchase decision. It is to be noted that the order of each pair of sites was counterbalanced so that if respondents had selected six items at site A, they were to select only two items at site B for further consideration; those who had selected two items at site A were to select six items at site B. Two control groups were formed. The ‘semi’ control group received identical instructions except that they were to select 2 items from each site. Therefore, their lists included 4 (and not 8) items. This was also the case for the baseline group whose respondents received no manipulations at all. In fact, they were simply directed to look for 2 items at each of the two sites. Survey questions preceded visits to each of the sites that included, amongst others, measures for the success of the manipulations. Respondents were then asked to select an item (from the list) as their final purchase decision. They were later informed that the item was not in stock. A series of questions then captured their reactions, both emotional and behavioural. •Summary of pertinent findings: We find support for the positive effect of lock-in on intention to choose the high lock-in site; however, of further interest, experience level, as a shopper, moderates this relationship. Experienced buyers are more likely to defect from the high lock-in site while inexperienced buyers are more likely to be enticed to stay at a high lock-in site. Mindset, independently, is not successful at predicting purchase intentions; however, when considered jointly with lock-in, the high lock-in site is found to incite both planned and unplanned purchase intentions. More precisely, in the high lock-in condition, the implemental mindset is more likely to purchase from the planned category while the deliberative mindset is more likely to purchase from the unplanned category. This is quite interesting in that it seems to contradict literature that high familiarity to a website primarily induces planned purchase intentions. In terms of results related to OOS, we highlight the higher likelihood of buyers to switch to the high than low lock-in site when they face an OOS. This trend also applies to buyers entering the low lock-in site in an implemental mindset – they neglect to choose another item from their lists, or visit yet other online stores that they could be acquainted with, or the traditional shops and instead return to the high lock-in site...|$|E

40|$|Comparing {{products}} and prices of on-line offers {{is important to}} <b>e-shoppers</b> and on-line retailers. The <b>e-shoppers</b> compare {{products and}} prices for finding the best product or price whereas the retailers need to compare their own products and prices to those of their competitors {{in order to remain}} competitive. As there is a wide range of product offers available on the Web the product and price comparison need to be done by an automated approach. One challenging task of such an approach is the automated assignment of different product offers which refer to the same real-world product. Products are compared and assigned based on the calculation of the pairwise similarity of their attributes. Thus, the attributes need to be identified, extracted and harmonised. In the case of the comparison of unit attributes harmonisation means to convert the attributes and their values into the same unit. The contribution of this paper is an approach and a corresponding ontology for identifying, extracting and harmonising unit attributes of product offers. The unit attribute ontology is introduced, the extraction process is described and the adequacy of the approach is validated through an experiment...|$|R

40|$|Despite many {{previous}} empirical {{investigations in}} the area of e-shopping, it is not clear why the adoption of e-shopping in one country is faster than in another country. This study investigates the motivation of e-shopping between two different countries from a qualitative approach. In particular, this paper compares between consumer perception of e-shopping in the United Kingdom (UK), a developed country and Malaysia, a developing country. The study explores the differences of behavioural aspect between consumers in the UK and Malaysia in terms of motives and reasons in conducting e-shopping. Focus group discussions were conducted with consumers, who were residing in the UK and Malaysia; who have adopted e-shopping for at least a year. Focusing on the actual consumers’ shopping experience and not their shopping intention, this approach gives more advantage in identifying the actual motives and reasons of adopting e-shopping. The study found that most of the motives and reasons of adopting e-shopping are associated with some of the innovation attributes by Rogers (that is, relative advantages, complexity and compatibility). <b>E-shoppers</b> are price sensitive, while trust and strong brand name are influential to <b>e-shoppers.</b> The lack of the motives and reasons explained why the adoption of e-shopping is slower in Malaysia. The study confirms that the motives and reasons of adopting innovation are consistent with Rogers’ Diffusion Theory.

Study 2 extracted items from two quantitative data sets, gathered by questionnaire from 172 and 125 online shoppers, by exploratory factor and reliability analyses. Study 3 applied psychometric testing and confirmatory factor analysis to data from a survey of 178 <b>e-shoppers.</b> Findings - The outcome is "E-tail SQ", a 15 -item scale to measure five key user values (labelled ease of use, information content, fulfilment reliability, security/privacy and post-purchase customer service). These scale items derived from French data are found to be similar to those identified in previous international studies, except that French <b>e-shoppers</b> place more emphasis than their English-speaking counterparts on internet security and privacy of personal information.

Surprisingly, village centres are less affected by e-shopping than city centres. Moreover, for neighbourhood and convenience centres the adverse effects of e-shopping are small. The probability of substituting e-shopping for in-store shopping at particular shopping locations is largely influenced by the extent to which people shop online, as well as personal and geographical factors. ...|$|R

Drawing upon Davis' technology acceptance model (TAM), the study proposes a model for the prediction of internet shopping adoption, with inclusions of personal and cognitive influence. The model identifies the structural relationships among eight constructs, which were examined through structural equation modelling. Findings – The results of this study yield evidence that previous technology acceptance and diffusion research, and specifically the significant body of work based on the TAM, may serve as a foundation for much needed research into consumers' adoption of internet‐related activities. Relationships among primary TAM constructs found in this research are largely consistent with those typical in previous TAM research.

This paper chronicles the development of a real-time interaction management system through the integration of historical data and online visitation patterns of e-commerce site visitors. It describes the scientific underpinnings of the system as well as its architecture. Experimental evaluation of the system shows that the caching and storage techniques built into the system deliver performance that is orders of magnitude better than those derived from off-the-shelf database components. © Springe...|$|R
40|$|E-commerce is a {{constantly}} growing and competitive market. Online prices are updated daily {{or even more}} frequently, {{and it is very}} important for <b>e-shoppers</b> to find the lowest price online. Therefore, e-shop owners need to know the prices of their competitors and must be able to adjust their own prices in order to remain competitive. The manual monitoring of all prices of all products and competitors is too time-consuming; hence, the e-shop owners need software support for that task. For the development of such software tools the developers need a profound comprehension of the structure and design of e-shop websites. Existing software tools for Web data extraction are based on the findings of different website analyzes. The existing tools show: The more specific and detailed the analysis and the analyzed websites, the better the data extraction results. This paper presents the results and the derived findings of a deep analysis of 50 different e-shop websites in order to provide new insights for the development and improvement of software tools for product data extraction from e-shop websites...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} Internet for {{information}} searching and purchasing {{of goods and services}} has rapidly increased. The development of e-shopping might have an impact on travel activity, but for the present the results from different studies are still inconclusive. In this paper the interaction between information searching, e-shopping, and travel activity is examined. The analysis is based on answers from 2700 Norwegian respondents. The dataset provides detailed information about the respondents’ activities and trips, and which type of goods and services they search {{for information}} about and purchase. The analysis indicates that there are different segments using the Internet for information and purchase, and that different types of goods attract different customers. The analyses of the interaction between e-shopping and travel suggest no direct relation between the two phenomena. There is no indication of substitution of travel by shopping online. The multivariate analyses show, rather, a higher mobility among frequent <b>e-shoppers</b> than among those buying on the Internet less often. E-shopping seems to be a complementary activity to traditional shopping, {{at least for the time}} being. ...|$|R
40|$|E-{{shopping}} {{might affect}} in-store shopping in different ways, substituting physical purchases, {{which is called}} substitution effect, or on the contrary encouraging more of them, which {{is referred to as}} complementarity. Previous studies suggest that the latter is the dominant effect, but that both coexist within the population. Disentangling the shopping behaviour and mobility within the population is the first step to study if this is the case. This research, based on data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN), performs a latent class analysis in order to identify different profiles of e-shopping/in-store shopping behaviour. The research identifies seven profiles of e-shoppers: typical shoppers, reluctant <b>e-shoppers,</b> occasional shoppers, reluctant in-store shoppers, store regulars, active shoppers and remote shoppers. 47 % of the population presents an above average e-shopping frequency and for 30 %, e-shopping seems to be the main shopping activity. Nevertheless, with regard to shopping mobility, the differences between the clusters are rather small and not significant for the most part. Therefore, e-shopping {{does not seem to have}} a significant reduction effect on shopper mobility, which was one of the considerations of policy makers when e-shopping began to develop.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} retailing landscape consumer {{satisfaction and}} loyalty have been key {{issues on the}} mind of many a marketer. With the growth of e-retailing, buyers and sellers have evolved; the traditional goals of satisfaction and loyalty remain but the means to achieving those have evolved with the changing online environment. As the competition continues to intensify, the costs of switching retailers remain low, and consumers adjust their spending patterns, it becomes increasingly important to provide shopping experiences of value to the consumer and to cultivate repeat purchase behavior. This paper provides a preliminary study into the interaction of various aspects of online shopping including value, trust, customer relationship management, satisfaction and how they contribute to loyalty among 18 - 24 year-old <b>e-shoppers.</b> A survey instrument was developed based on previously published work on online shopping. Respondents within the demographic were recruited and {{asked to respond to}} the questionnaire items based on a Likert scale that was provided with the survey. All responses were entered into SPPS and analyzed through correlation and regression techniques. Within the sample all hypothesized relationships were found to exist, and all aspects wer...|$|R
40|$|In France, {{e-commerce}} {{has experienced}} steady {{growth over the}} past decade. A striking aspect {{is that it is}} now widespread among different segments of the population, including suburban and rural households. This growth has generated significant demand for dedicated delivery services to end consumers. Pickup points (PP) represent a fast-growing alternative to home delivery, accounting for about 20 % of parcel deliveries to households. The article focuses on the strategy of PP network operators. Our results are threefold. We have documented the récent development of alternative parcel delivery services to <b>e-shoppers</b> in Europe, and especially in France. We have described how the operators have decided to organize their PP network, identifying main variables and constraints. We have provided an analysis of the spatial distribution of PPs in France. The paper shows that at the French national level, PPs are nowawell established alternative to home deliveries and their presence covers urban, suburban and rural areas. While PP density in remote areas decreases faster than population density, rural e-consumers' accessibility to PP sites has reached a viable level. Furthermore, PP delivery services generate new types of B 2 B freight trips that are not yet included in current urban freight models...|$|R
30|$|Inter-context trust {{transfer}} for {{the same}} entity seems to be both a relatively new and rarely studied concept. Though cross-context transfer occurs regularly in our daily lives, the main treatment {{of it as a}} research question seems to be the recent work on how consumers transfer their trust in retailers’ brick-and-mortar stores to their online stores. Stewart introduced this retailer cross-context trust in 1999 and followed it up in 2003 with an experiment that showed users’ trust intentions and intentions to buy from an online retailer were increased if the retailer’s site showed a picture of a building or physical retail location [7]. Riegelsberger and Sasse demonstrated similar results in a 2001 study on cues online retailers could employ to increase user trust in their sites: specifically, “Inexperienced <b>e-shoppers</b> are likely to transfer trust: They will give on-line shopping a first try with retail organizations they are familiar with” [17]. This cross-context trust transfer has also evolved as web commerce has grown in popularity and complexity. In 2011, Lu et al. published a paper on consumer trust transfer from web-based payment services to mobile-based services in much the same manner consumers transferred trust from brick-and-mortar stores to web sites [18].|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the impact of Internet {{features}} on the behavior of both consumers and online retailers aspiring to apply eligible online pricing and business strategies. Price is considered {{to be one of the}} most significant marketing policy factors, the importance of which is in highly competitive online market environment, compared to usual brick and mortar stores, noticeably amended. Online price comparison service delivered to public by so called shopbots/pricebots forced the <b>e-shoppers</b> to pay more attention to their pricing policies and competitors' business conduct. Moreover, shopbots gave to consumers an easily accessible platform for gathering products, services and market offers information. The thesis is divided into five chapters offering a complex insight into the aforementioned issues. With help of both author's own empirical study and other academic papers it points out the price on Internet is variously significant for different price ranges of products. Even though Internet might seem to have the features of perfectly competitive market to some extent, the persistence of price dispersion is indisputable evidence that e-retailers are not successful due to the lowest prices but primarily due to the overall business strategy and the strength of brand perception. This fact has not been changed even after the appearance of shopbots...|$|R
