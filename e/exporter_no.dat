We studied {{the role of}} fringing wetlands on OM dynamics under two discharge regimes in three river systems. Fringing wetlands common in this region are characterized by wetland plants, saturated soils, and are bisected by a persistent river channel. At all sites, increased discharge elevated TOM concentration at upstream control and wetland sites (60 - 70 % increase; range 4. 4 18. 0 g/m 3). Nutrient limitation (ambient concentrations and nutrient diffusers) indicated that nitrogen {{dynamics in}} wetlands shifted from storage to export at low vs. high flows, respectively. Fringing wetlands tended to act as net OM producers (<b>exporters)</b> <b>no</b> matter discharge regime, although one stream, Augusta Creek, was storing OM during base flow. Results in part contradict the role of wetlands as sites of OM retention, but this functional role reversal is not surprising given the close proximity of the fringing wetlands to their respective streams. Furthermore, results imply that fringing wetlands {{play an important role}} supporting detrital food webs...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the relation between}} a firm’s productivity and its joint decision {{of research and development}} (R&D) strategy and exporting, based on Japanese firm-level data and the simple theoretical framework that extends the firm heterogeneity model so that both internal and external (outsourcing or technology purchase) R&D strategies are taken into account. The empirical results from nonparametric and semiparametric methods show that exporting firms engaged in R&D activities are more productive than non-exporters and <b>exporters</b> with <b>no</b> R&D, regardless of whether internal or external R&D strategy is adopted, and that exporters which employ both R&D strategies are the most productive. The results suggest that an open innovation strategy is complementary to an in-house R&D strategy and is crucial for further promoting innovation for internationalized firms...|$|R

40|$|Being one of {{the smaller}} players in Australasia, New Zealand and its <b>exporters</b> have <b>no</b> choice but to seek new trading {{partners}} in countries with often-unfamiliar cultures. This paper presents guidance for marketing managers seeking to trade with an emerging Pacific Rim trading partner for the Australasian region, Argentina. Prior research into international cultural differences was used to construct a negotiating-preference questionnaire sent to New Zealand /Argentinean business managers doing business with each other. New Zealand and Argentinean managers tended to rank and rate negotiation elements similarly, but the behaviours comprising these elements were seen differently. Argentinean evaluations were dramatically opposed to stereotypical conceptions of South American behaviour regarding the relative importance of social elements and the supposed unimportance of time. The results suggest further research and represent a strong warning against basing Australasian/South American market actions on stereotypical notions alone-regardless of how widely they may be held...|$|R

This {{is a source}} of concern for some observers who argue that this kind of specialisation overexpose Italian manufacturing to the competition of low cost producers, especially those located in emerging economies. We verify how intense is the competitive pressure on Italian exporters of traditional goods through a synthetic measure of their market power. We make use of the coincidence of the concept of relative mark up (or Lerner index), as an indicator of market power, with that of elasticity of the residual demand curve. Our findings indicate that assertions as to the excessive exposure of the Italian specialised sectors (textile, apparel, footwear, leather, ceramics, wooden furniture) to the pricing policies of competitors are questionable. Over the period considered (the 80 s’ and the 90 s’) Italian exporters were able to practice mark ups over marginal cost in most of the products/markets we analysed.

40|$|Although bigleaf {{mahogany}} [Swietenia macrophylla King (Meliaceae) ] is {{the premier}} timber species of Latin America, its exploitation is unsustainable {{because of a}} pattern of local depletion and shifting supply. We surveyed experts {{on the status of}} mahogany in Bolivia and Peru, the world&# 039;s past and present largest <b>exporters.</b> Bolivia <b>no</b> longer has commercially viable mahogany (trees > 60 cm diameter at breast height) across 79 % of its range. In Peru, mahogany&# 039;s range has shrunk by 50 %, and, within a decade, a further 28 % will be logged out. Approximately 15 % of the mahogany range in these two countries is protected, but low densities and illegal logging mean that this overestimates the extent of mahogany under protection. The international community can support mahogany conservation by funding park management and by encouraging independent verification of the legality of mahogany in trade. Our findings demonstrate that a systematic expert survey can generate reliable and cost-effective information on the status of widespread species of concern and help to inform appropriate management policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{case for}} {{stabilizing}} China’s exchange rate {{against the dollar}} is strong. Before 2005 when the yuan/dollar rate was credibly fixed, it helped anchor China’s domestic price level. But gradual RMB appreciation from July 2005 to July 2008 created a “one-way-bet ” that disordered China’s financial markets in two respects: (1) no private capital outflows to finance China’s huge trade surplus leading to an undue build up of official exchange reserves and erosion of monetary control, and (2) {{a breakdown of the}} forward exchange market in 2007 - 08 so that <b>exporters</b> could <b>no</b> longer get trade credit—probably worsening the severe slump in Chinese exports. But after July 2008, the credit crunch induced an unexpected unwinding of the dollar carry trade leading to a sharp appreciation in the dollar’s effective exchange rate. The People’s Bank of China (PBC) then stopped RMB appreciation against the dollar. China’s forward exchange market was restored and monetary control regained. Now the PBC can better support the fiscal stimulus by promoting a parallel expansion of bank credit**...|$|R
40|$|Large {{exporters}} {{are simultaneously}} large importers. In this paper, {{we show that}} this pattern is key to understanding low aggregate exchange rate pass-through {{as well as the}} variation in pass-through across exporters. First, we develop a theoretical framework that combines variable markups due to strategic complementarities and endogenous choice to import intermediate inputs. The model predicts that firms with high import shares and high market shares have low exchange rate pass-through. Second, we test and quantify the theoretical mechanisms using Belgian firm-product-level data with information on exports by destination and imports by source country. We confi rm that import intensity and market share are the prime determinants of pass-through in the cross-section of fi rms. A small <b>exporter</b> with <b>no</b> imported inputs has a nearly complete pass-through of over 90 percent, while a firm at the 95 th percentile of both import intensity and market share distributions has a pass-through of 56 percent, with the marginal cost and markup channels playing roughly equal roles. The largest exporters are simultaneously highmarket-share and high-import-intensity firms, which helps explain the low aggregate pass-through and exchange rate disconnect observed in the data...|$|R
40|$|I study climate {{policy choices}} for a “policy bloc” of fuel-{{importers}}, when a “fringe” of other fuel importers have no climate policy, fuel <b>exporters</b> consume <b>no</b> fossil fuels, and importers produce no such fuels. The policy bloc and exporter blocs act strategically in fossil fuel markets. When the policy bloc sets a carbon tax, the fuel import price {{set by the}} exporter is reduced, and more so when the policy bloc is larger. The carbon tax then serves to extract the exporter’s rent. The fringe also gains from reduced fuel import prices, and gains more when the policy bloc is larger. When the policy bloc sets an emissions cap, fuel demand becomes less price elastic. In response, a monopolistic exporter sets the fuel export price higher than under a tax, which hurts both the policy bloc and the fringe. This effect can be stronger when the policy bloc is larger, so that the fringe loses when the policy bloc is larger, opposite to the tax policy case. Overall, a cap is inferior to a tax for fossil fuel importers, both those that implement a climate policy, {{and those that do}} not. climate policy, carbon taxes, cap-and-trade schemes, carbon emissions, strategic trade policy...|$|R

We argue subsides may {{have a role to}} play in that process. Using a longitudinal database (1996 - 2003) at the plant level, this paper aims to shed light on the causal nexus between production-related subsidies and exports, in Portugal. We implement a propensity score matching approach in order to evaluate the effects of subsidies on both the probability of domestic firms to begin exporting and on the probability of increasing the export share of already <b>exporters.</b> We find <b>no</b> impact of subsidies on the ability of domestic firms to become exporters; additionally, no effects of subsidies are detected on export shares. Such disappointing results may be explained by the inefficiency in the granting criteria. Subsidies, Exports, Portugal, Matching...|$|R
40|$|WTO {{negotiations}} deal predominantly with bound - besides applied - tariff rates. But, how can {{reductions in}} tariffs ceilings, i. e. tariff rates that <b>no</b> <b>exporter</b> may ever actually be confronted with, generate market access? The {{answer to this}} question relates to the effects of tariff bindings on the risk that exporters face in destination markets. The present paper formalizes the underlying interaction of risk, fixed export costs and firms' market entry decisions based on techniques known from the real options literature; doing so we highlight the important role of bound tariffs at the extensive margin of trade. We find that bound tariffs are more effective with higher risk destination markets, that a large binding overhang may still command substantial market access, and that reductions in bound tariffs generate effective market access even when bound rates are above current and long-term applied rates...|$|R
30|$|A key {{observation}} is {{the positive and}} statistically significant coefficient {{on the number of}} export items (HS) for developing countries. This is particularly true in SSA and LAC countries and to a certain extent in MENA too. This suggests that after controlling for export-output ratio, adding new export items has significant employment benefits for countries that have yet to become accomplished <b>exporters</b> of manufactures. <b>No</b> such employment benefits accompany export diversification in ASIA and OECD countries, which currently dominate world exports of manufactures. The marginal employment benefits from product adding seem to decline with the scale of export activities. This appears to resonate with the findings of Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) that as countries develop, their economies become increasingly less (more) concentrated (diversified) until a threshold level of per capita income is reached, beyond which specialization kicks in.|$|R
40|$|Does trade {{liberalization}} increase aggregate productivity through reallocation toward more productive firms or through productivity increases at individual firms? Using a trade model with heterogeneous firms, this paper argues that aggregate productivity gains come from firm-level productivity increases. The process of reallocation that follows {{trade liberalization}} — the exit {{of the least}} efficient firms {{and the movement of}} resources toward more efficient firms, particularly <b>exporters</b> — has <b>no</b> long-term effect on real value added per worker. This paper therefore considers how trade liberalization affects technology adoption by individual firms. If technology improvements are not costly — for example, if they occur through dynamic spillover effects — then trade liberalization has the potential to generate large increases in productivity. ________________________________________________________________________ *I would especially like to thank Tim Kehoe and Cristina Arellano for advice and encouragement.

40|$|Recent {{discussions on}} U. S. trade {{policies}} suggest that import quotas should be auctioned {{to ensure the}} U. S. Treasury acquires the quota rent. However, studies estimating the potential benefits have ignored important details of import quota regimes and have assumed perfect competition and <b>no</b> <b>exporter</b> retaliation. We explore these three issues with an application to the U. S. cheese import quota regime. We show that when features of the U.

While quota license sales may raise Treasury receipts, they may also cause a net welfare loss. Key words: imperfect competition, import quotas, licenses, quota rents, U. S. cheese imports.

40|$|Each {{month the}} U. S. Census Bureau {{receives}} from the Customs and Border Protection Service documents describing all U. S. exports over $ 2, 500. Most exporters now file the required documents via the Automated Export System. Because of filing options, {{for the majority}} of <b>exporters,</b> we have <b>no</b> information on &quot;low-valued &quot; exports (LVEs), those valued at or below the exemption level of $ 2, 500; for the remainder, we have records for all LVEs. As exporters are not required to report their LVEs, the Census Bureau estimates the low-valued component for any country by multiplying its total of exports valued over $ 2, 500 by a pre-determined factor. This factor, specific to the country of export, was determined in the late 1980 's based on data collected up to that point in time. However, while export patterns [...] commodities, modes of transport, quantities, and values [...] have changed, the factors remain the same. Some experts believe that the current system may underestimate LVEs. In this paper, we look back at research into several approaches to estimate LVEs. The goal was to develop robust procedures that accurately represent what is currently being exported, and can adapt over time with minimal review to reflect changes in export patterns.

40|$|What {{explains}} Germany’s superb export performance? Is Germany’s export behaviour very distinct {{compared to}} other European countries? The authors explore the organisational responses to competition of 14, 000 exporting firms in seven European countries. The paper examines the export business model of the median exporter and of the top one percent exporters in each country, accounting for 20 percent to 55 percent of total exports. What do these firms do to become superstars? The authors find, first, that the export market share of the median exporter {{in each of the}} countries to the world more than tripled (in some cases the export market share increases tenfold) for firms that combine decentralised management with offshoring of production to low-wage countries. Exporters which abstain from any organisational adjustment do very badly. Decentralised management provides incentives for workers for product improvements allowing exporters to compete on quality. Offshoring production to low-wage countries reduces costs allowing exporters to compete on price. Second, we find that Germany is the leading quality exporter in Europe followed by Austria and Spain. Among the top 10 percent of <b>exporters</b> there is <b>no</b> single firm with low quality in Germany and Austria, which suggest that decentralised management has provided incentives for quality in these countries. Third, Germany’s exports are less vulnerable to price increases, while exports from France and Italy respond strongly to price changes, and thus costs reductions via offshoring benefits these countries most...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focussed}} on assessing smallholder groundnut {{farmers and}} traders’ access to markets through quality improvement and also, determine the socio-economic {{factors that influence}} groundnut farmers when deciding to adopt quality management techniques and the extent/or level of involvement. The following research questions were tested: whether Malawi smallholder groundnut farmers have poor or limited access to markets; whether smallholder farmers face unequal bargaining relations with traders due perhaps to lack of competition in trading channels; whether belonging to a farmer organisation provides a framework whereby the prospects of higher prices could lead to higher quality regulated by the association? Qualitative {{analysis was used to}} map out the main processes, key actors and relationships within the various groundnut value chains. Price spread method was used to assess market efficiency in price for the various groundnut market channels. Finally, a Selective Tobit model was used to assess factors that influence smallholder farmers to adopt technologies on quality management and decide the extent of adoption. The study results indicated that smallholder farmers manage to sell all their groundnuts brought to the market. This means that smallholder farmers do not really have problems accessing the markets. However, there is a limited availability of structured groundnut markets that offer premium price as an incentive for farmers to invest in quality management. Another important finding is that belonging to an organised farmer organisation enabled smallholder farmers to access better agricultural services such as research, extension and quality certified seed. However, it was not enough to persuade the farmers to venture into collective marketing. The results suggest that the provision of economic incentives such as premium prices persuaded farmers to engage in collective action and also invest in quality management. There is convergence of prices for less quality sensitive regional markets and quality sensitive EU markets. As such, <b>exporters</b> have <b>no</b> incentive to invest more in quality management targeting EU markets. Selective Tobit model results showed that farmers value most profitability-related variables such as land allocated, structured markets and prices when deciding level of involvement in quality management. The study results also indicate that groundnut market in Malawi is efficient in price as demonstrated by the Market Efficiency Index of greater than one. Gross margin analysis also indicated that, on average, groundnuts producers have good returns to labour if compared to the current national minimum wage rate of US 1. 2 per day...|$|R
40|$|The China - Raw Materials dispute {{recently}} arbitrated by the WTO opposed China as defendant to the US and the EU as claimants, on {{the somewhat}} unusual issue of export restrictions. For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials {{of which the}} country is a major producer create shortages in foreign markets. This scarcity does not prevail in the Chinese market and the price in the foreign markets increases, providing a cost advantage to the Chinese industries using these raw materials. China defends export limitations using Article XX of the GATT 1994 on possible exceptions to the prohibition of quantitative restrictions to conserve natural resources. This paper oers a theoretical analysis of the dispute {{with the help of}} a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets using Fischer and Laxminarayan (2004) 's framework. The theoretical results focus on the eects of imposing an export quota on quantities, prices and ecacy, and are used to comment on the claims of the parties and on the ndings of the Panel and Appellate Body. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the con ict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the claimants as well as of China { for each product concerned in the case, dened at the HS 6 level. The empirical results show that among the products concerned in the dispute, two groups can be dierentiated depending on China's export position. When China is a major or rst <b>exporter,</b> there is <b>no</b> evident sign of the distortionary eect of an exportquota. When China is a weak exporter, but a strong producer and consumer, thereis evidence coherent with the model according to which China is imposing a quotaexport restriction that is inecient...|$|R
