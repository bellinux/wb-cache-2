40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a hierarchical}} Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression {{to the experience}} of chronic <b>dyshomeostasis.</b> Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of <b>dyshomeostasis</b> (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain’s model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain’s capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of <b>dyshomeostasis</b> and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behaviour), the experience of chronic <b>dyshomeostasis</b> may trigger a generalised belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue in the future...|$|E

The pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) proteins in the brain. Since AD etiology remains unclear, several hypotheses have emerged to elucidate its pathological pathways. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, a leading hypothesis for AD development, advocates Aβ as the principal culprit. Additionally, evidence suggests that tau may contribute to AD pathology. Aβ and tau have {{also been shown to}} impact each other's pathology either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, metal ion <b>dyshomeostasis</b> is associated with these misfolded proteins.

ATP 13 A 2 encodes a protein that is highly expressed in neurons and is predicted to function as a cation pump, although the substrate specificity remains unclear. Accumulation of zinc and mitochondrial dysfunction are established aetiological factors that contribute to PD; however, their underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Using patient-derived human olfactory neurosphere cultures, which harbour loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of ATP 13 A 2, we identified a low intracellular free zinc ion concentration ([Zn 2 +]i), altered expression of zinc transporters and impaired sequestration of Zn 2 + into autophagy-lysosomal pathway-associated vesicles, indicating that zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> occurs in the setting of ATP 13 A 2 deficiency. Pharmacological treatments that increased [Zn 2 +]i also induced the production of reactive oxygen species and aggravation of mitochondrial abnormalities that gave rise to mitochondrial depolarization, fragmentation and cell death due to ATP depletion. The toxic effect of Zn 2 + was blocked by ATP 13 A 2 overexpression, Zn 2 + chelation, antioxidant treatment and promotion of mitochondrial fusion. Taken together, these results indicate that human ATP 13 A 2 deficiency results in zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> in PD and its contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction with ATP 13 A 2 as a molecular link between the two distinctive aetiological factors of PD.

40|$|Protein <b>dyshomeostasis</b> is {{the common}} {{mechanism}} of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aging is the key risk factor, as {{the capacity of the}} proteostasis network declines during aging. Different cellular stress conditions result in the up-regulation of the neurotrophic, neuroprotective amyloid precursor protein (APP). Enzymatic processing of APP may result in formation of toxic Aβ aggregates (β-amyloids). Protein folding is the basis of life and death. Intracellular Aβ affects the function of subcellular organelles by disturbing the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria cross-talk and causing severe Ca 2 +-dysregulation and lipid <b>dyshomeostasis.</b> The extensive and complex network of proteostasis declines during aging and is not able to maintain the balance between production and disposal of proteins. The effectivity of cellular pathways that safeguard cells against proteotoxic stress (molecular chaperones, aggresomes, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy) declines with age. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion causes dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and thus the Aβ-clearance from brain-to-blood decreases. Microglia-mediated clearance of Aβ also declines, Aβ accumulates in the brain and causes neuroinflammation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{determinants of}} Alzheimer's (AD) disease {{are still not}} completely known; however, {{in the past two}} decades, a large body of evidence has indicated that an important contributing factor for the disease is the development of an unbalanced homeostasis of two signaling cations: calcium (Ca 2 +) and zinc (Zn 2 +). Both ions serve a critical role in the physiological functioning of the central nervous system, but their brain deregulation promotes amyloid-β dysmetabolism as well as tau phosphorylation. AD is also characterized by an altered glutamatergic activation, and glutamate can promote both Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + <b>dyshomeostasis.</b> The two cations can operate synergistically to promote the generation of free radicals that further intracellular Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + rises and {{set the stage for a}} self-perpetuating harmful loop.

This chronic redistribution deprives Zn from other tissues and organs and compromises critical physiological functions in the body. The cardinal symptoms of Zn deficiency are anorexia, systemic inflammation, growth failure in children, and hypogonadism.

Moreover, such incremental knowledge will serve as the underpinning to the development of novel strategies aimed at preventing and/or regressing the ongoing adverse remodelling of myocardium.

40|$|Abstract Zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important mechanism for cell death in acute brain injury. An {{increase in the level}} of free or histochemically reactive zinc in astrocytes and neurons {{is considered one of the}} major causes of death of these cells in ischemia and trauma. Although zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> can lead to cell death via diverse routes, the major pathway appears to involve oxidative stress. Recently, we found that a rise of zinc in autophagic vacuoles, including autolysosomes, is a prerequisite for lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death in cultured brain cells exposed to oxidative stress conditions. The source of zinc in this process is likely redox-sensitive zinc-binding proteins such as metallothioneins, which release zinc under oxidative conditions. Of the metallothioneins, metallothionein- 3 is especially enriched in the central nervous system, but its physiologic role in this tissue is not well established. Like other metallothioneins, metallothionein- 3 may function as metal detoxicant, but is also known to inhibit neurite outgrowth and, sometimes, promote neuronal death, likely by serving as a source of toxic zinc release. In addition, metallothionein- 3 regulates lysosomal functions. In the absence of metallothionein- 3, there are changes in lysosome-associated membrane protein- 1 and - 2, and reductions in certain lysosomal enzymes that result in decreased autophagic flux. This may have dual effects on cell survival. In acute oxidative injury, zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> and lysosomal membrane permeabilization are diminished in metallothionein- 3 null cells, resulting in less cell death. But over the longer term, diminished lysosomal function may lead to the accumulation of abnormal proteins and cause cytotoxicity. The roles of zinc and metallothionein- 3 in autophagy and/or lysosomal function have just begun to be investigated. In light of evidence that autophagy and lysosomes may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, further insight into the contribution of zinc dynamics and metallothionein- 3 function may help provide ways to effectively regulate these processes in brain cells. </p...|$|E

40|$|Imbalance {{of brain}} metal {{homeostasis}} and associated oxidative stress by redox-active metals like iron and copper {{is an important}} trigger of neurotoxicity in several neurodegenerative conditions, including prion disorders. Whereas some reports attribute this to end-stage disease, others provide evidence for specific mechanisms leading to brain metal <b>dyshomeostasis</b> during disease progression. In prion disorders, imbalance of brain-iron homeostasis is observed before end-stage disease and worsens with disease progression, implicating iron-induced oxidative stress in disease pathogenesis. This is an unexpected observation, because the underlying cause of brain pathology in all prion disorders is PrP-scrapie (PrPSc), a β-sheet–rich conformation of a normal glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrPC). Whether brain-iron <b>dyshomeostasis</b> occurs because of gain of toxic function by PrPSc or loss of normal function of PrPC remains unclear. In this review, we summarize available evidence suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in prion-disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, we review the biology of PrPC to highlight its possible role in maintaining brain metal homeostasis during health and the contribution of PrPSc in inducing brain metal imbalance with disease progression.

Substantial evidence indicates that disrupted neuronal homeostasis of different metal ions such as Fe, Cu, Pb, Hg, Se, and Zn may mediate synaptic dysfunction and impair synapse formation and maturation. Here, we performed in vitro studies investigating the consequences of an imbalance of transition metals on glutamatergic synapses of hippocampal neurons. We analyzed whether an imbalance of any one metal ion alters cell health and synapse numbers. Moreover, we evaluated whether a biometal profile characteristic for ASD patients influences synapse formation, maturation, and composition regarding NMDA receptor subunits and Shank proteins. Our results show that an ASD like biometal profile leads to a reduction of NMDAR (NR/Grin/GluN) subunit 1 and 2 a, as well as Shank gene expression along with a reduction of synapse density. Additionally, synaptic protein levels of GluN 2 a and Shanks are reduced. Although Zn supplementation is able to rescue the aforementioned alterations, Zn deficiency is not solely responsible as causative factor. Thus, we conclude that balancing Zn levels in ASD might be a prime target to normalize synaptic alterations caused by biometal <b>dyshomeostasis...</b>|$|E

Dornan et al suggest that the results seen in their study maybe due to AB+IBO working synergistically via NMDA receptors to cause calcium <b>dyshomeostasis.</b> Another way that calcium <b>dyshomeostasis</b> occurs in the brain is via glucocorticoids.

40|$|ABSTRACT Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease, causing severe dopamine depletion in the striatum. Evidence shows that iron <b>dyshomeostasis</b> contributes to PD. Our long term {{goal is to}} improve the understanding of iron associated PD, thereby pave the way for nutritional prevention against PD in clinical trials. In this dissertation, the overarching hypotheses were that the neurotoxin 6 -OHDA caused iron <b>dyshomeostasis</b> by regulating iron-related factors, increasing oxidative damage to neuron cells, while the iron chelator EGCG could counteract these adverse effects and prevent PD. PD model cells are used to study the mechanism on disruption of iron metabolism by 6 -OHDA in vitro. In the first study, we determined that 6 -OHDA caused iron <b>dyshomeostasis</b> in N 27 cells by regulating iron transporters and regulators expression, such as DMT 1, TfR, and hepcidin. We have direct evidence showing 6 -OHDA caused iron burden by 55 Fe iron uptake assay. 6 -OHDA also caused primary neuron cell death. However, we confirmed that EGCG protected against 6 -OHDA induced neurotoxicity. EGCG reduced the intracellular iron retention by decreasing the iron importers and increasing iron exporters, such as Fpn 1. In the second study, we further confirmed that increased iron by 6 -OHDA augmented ROS generation and caused oxidative damage to lipid and protein in vitro. The increased activities of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory system, including Nrf 2, HO- 1, and PPARγ, suggested the increased oxidation and inflammation. However, EGCG attenuated ROS generation, reduced oxidative stress, and blocked the consequential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory reactions. Since EGCG is the most abundant polyphenol and iron chelator present in green tea, it may offer a prospective dietary approach to protect PD patients. In the third study, we hypothesized that green tea consumption may be beneficial for PD patients. We have shown that an intervention of 3 cups of green tea daily for 3 months improved the antioxidant status and reduced oxidative damage in early PD patients without affecting their iron status. In summary, the findings in this project reveal the importance of iron regulation in PD progression and that the beneficial effects of EGCG act as a promising preventive approach for PD both in vitro and in vivo...|$|E

Zinc is released into the synaptic cleft of glutamatergic neurons alongside glutamate from where it interacts and modulates NMDA and AMPA receptors. In addition, zinc has multifactorial functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Zinc is critical in the enzymatic nonamyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in the enzymatic degradation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Zinc binds to Aβ promoting its aggregation into neurotoxic species, and disruption of zinc homeostasis in the brain results in synaptic and memory deficits. Thus, zinc <b>dyshomeostasis</b> may have a critical {{role to play in}} the pathogenesis of AD, and the chelation of zinc is a potential therapeutic approach...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder which {{is characterized by}} an increasing impairment in normal memory and cognitive processes that significantly diminishes a person’s daily functioning. Despite decades of research and advances {{in our understanding of}} disease aetiology and pathogenesis, there are still no effective disease-modifying drugs available for the treat-ment of AD. However, numerous compounds are currently undergoing pre-clinical and clinical evaluations. These candidate pharma-cotherapeutics are aimed at various aspects of the disease, such as the microtubule-associated -protein, the amyloid- (A) peptide and metal ion <b>dyshomeostasis</b> – all of which are involved in the development and progression of AD. We will review the way these phar-macological strategies target the biochemical and clinical features of the disease and the investigational drugs for each category...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of copper <b>dyshomeostasis</b> with neurodegenerative diseases has become {{evident in the}} last years. Because of the major role that this metal ion plays in biological processes, most of which being located in the brain, {{it is not surprising}} that changes in its distribution are closely related with the advent of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An increasing number of works have dealt with this subject in the last years, and opened an intense debate in some points while raising new questions that still remain unanswered. This revision work puts together and discusses the latest findings and insights on how copper ions are involved in AD progression, including its interaction with Aβ and its consequently induced aggregation...|$|E
40|$|Neurotoxicity in all prion {{disorders}} {{is believed}} to result from the accumulation of PrP-scrapie (PrP(Sc)), a beta-sheet rich isoform of a normal cell-surface glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrP(C)). Limited reports suggest imbalance of brain iron homeostasis as a significant associated cause of neurotoxicity in prion-infected cell and mouse models. However, systematic studies on the generality of this phenomenon and the underlying mechanism(s) leading to iron <b>dyshomeostasis</b> in diseased brains are lacking. In this report, we demonstrate that prion disease-affected human, hamster, and mouse brains show increased total and redox-active Fe (II) iron, and a paradoxical increase in major iron uptake proteins transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (TfR) at the end stage of disease. Furthermore, examination of scrapie-inoculated hamster brains at different timepoints following infection shows increased levels of Tf with time, suggesting increasing iron deficiency with disease progression. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) -affected human brains show a similar increase in total iron and a direct correlation between PrP and Tf levels, implicating PrP(Sc) as the underlying cause of iron deficiency. Increased binding of Tf to the cerebellar Purkinje cell neurons of sCJD brains further indicates upregulation of TfR and a phenotype of neuronal iron deficiency in diseased brains despite increased iron levels. The likely cause of this phenotype is sequestration of iron in brain ferritin that becomes detergent-insoluble in PrP(Sc) -infected cell lines and sCJD brain homogenates. These results suggest that sequestration of iron in PrP(Sc) -ferritin complexes induces a state of iron bio-insufficiency in prion disease-affected brains, resulting in increased uptake and a state of iron <b>dyshomeostasis.</b> An additional unexpected observation is the resistance of Tf to digestion by proteinase-K, providing a reliable marker for iron levels in postmortem human brains. These data implicate redox-iron in prion disease-associated neurotoxicity, a novel observation with significant implications for prion disease pathogenesis...|$|E
