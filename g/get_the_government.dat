500|$|In June 1949, while Rowell {{was acting}} Chief of the General Staff, {{the country was}} rocked by the 1949 Australian coal strike. The strike began when stocks of coal were already low, {{especially}} in New South Wales and rationing was introduced. The Chifley government turned to the Army to get the troops to mine coal. This became possible when the transport unions agreed to transport coal that was mined. Rowell delegated responsibility for planning and organising the effort to Lieutenant General Berryman, while Rowell flew [...] "top cover", liaising with the government ministers in Sydney. Rowell managed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to pay a bonus to soldiers mining coal, and persuaded the government to allow soldiers to have beer in their canteens, although the local civilians had none.|$|E

[...] Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard commented that [...] "there was some difference of opinion as to whether it was sound policy to execute spies and to begin with a patriotic spy like Lody." [...] According to Robert Jackson, the biographer of Lody's prosecutor Sir Archibald Bodkin, Lody's [...] "bearing and frankness when caught so impressed Britain's spy-catchers and prosecutors that they talked about trying to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> to waive the internationally recognised rule that spies caught in wartime automatically are put to death.

[...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to act. [...] "Mora reached out for help before he was killed, and no one came to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author.

[...] The editorial concluded by imploring Costa Ricans to re-evaluate their personal environmental habits and support environmental groups that keep fighting.

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the Protestant cause was making {{progress}} in Scotland too, {{by its own}} inherent energies, and against {{the influence of the}} government. Finally, the Scotch Protestants organized themselves, and commenced an open rebellion against the regent whom Mary had left in power while she was away. They sent to Elizabeth to come and aid them. Mary and her friends in France sent French troops to assist the government. Elizabeth hesitated very much whether to comply with the request of the rebels. It is very dangerous for a sovereign to countenance rebellion in any way. Then she shrunk, too, from the expense which she foresaw that such an attempt would involve. To fit out a fleet, and to levy and equip an army, and to continue the forces thus raised in action during a long and uncertain campaign, would cost a large sum of money, and Elizabeth was constitutionally economical and frugal. But then, on the other hand, as she deliberated upon the affair long and, anxiously, both alone and with her council, she thought that, if she should so far succeed as to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Scotland into her power, she could compel Mary to renounce forever all claims to the English crown, by threatening her, if she would not do it, with the loss of her own.|$|E
