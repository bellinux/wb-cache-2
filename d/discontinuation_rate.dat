25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rate</b> (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Despite the {{widespread}} use of highly effective contraceptive methods in France, one in every three pregnancies is unintended. Among women experiencing an unintended pregnancy leading to an abortion, half had changed their contraceptive method in the 6 months preceding the abortion, in most cases switching to a less-effective method or to no method at all. This study provides estimates of method-specific contraceptive <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> for any reason and for method-related reasons among French women. METHODS: The data were drawn from the COCON survey (2000 - 2004), a population-based French prospective cohort, comprising a representative sample of 2863 women aged 18 - 44. We estimated Kaplan-Meier life-table probabilities of contraceptive discontinuation during the 4 years of follow-up and tested for differences by intrauterine device (IUD) type and pill composition. RESULTS: Probabilities of contraceptive discontinuation for method-related reasons varied widely by method: IUDs were associated with the lowest probabilities of discontinuation (11 % within 12 months, 30 % within 4 years), followed by the pill (22 % and 48 %, respectively). <b>Discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly higher for all other methods (condoms, withdrawal, fertility awareness methods and spermicides). We found no differences in <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> by the type of IUD (levonorgestrel-IUD versus copper-IUD) and increasing <b>rates</b> of pill <b>discontinuation</b> with decreasing dosage in estrogen. CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> among French women are substantially lower than those reported for US women. Comparing the determinants of contraceptive discontinuation and the role of healthcare providers in helping women make these changes would improve our understanding of the reasons for such variation...|$|R

It was 5% {{more effective than}} risperidone (4th), 24-27% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 33% less effective than clozapine (1st). A 2013 review of first episode schizophrenia concluded that olanzapine is superior to haloperidol in providing a lower <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rate,</b> and in short-term symptom reduction, response rate, negative symptoms, depression, cognitive function, discontinuation due to poor efficacy, and long-term relapse, but not in positive symptoms or on the Clinical Global Impressions score. In contrast, pooled second generation antipsychotics showed superiority to first generation antipsychotics only against the discontinuation, negative symptoms (with a much larger effect seen among industry- compared to government-sponsored studies), and cognition scores. [...] Olanzapine caused less extrapyramidal side effects, less akathisia, but caused significantly more weight gain, serum cholesterol increase, and triglyceride increase than haloperidol. A 2012 review concluded that among 10 atypical antipsychotics, only clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone were better than first generation antipsychotics. A 2011 review concluded that neither first- nor second generation antipsychotics produce clinically meaningful changes in Clinical Global Impression scores but found that olanzapine and amisulpride produce larger effects on the PANSS and BPRS batteries than five other second generation antipsychotics or pooled first generation antipsychotics. A 2010 Cochrane systematic review found that olanzapine may have a slight advantage in effectiveness when compared to aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. No differences in effectiveness was detected when comparing olanzapine to amisulpride and clozapine.|$|E

An extensive Medline Embase and Cochrane search was performed including the following words: 'PDE 5 i', 'discontinuation'. All observational studies reporting the dropout rate of PDE 5 i and its specific causes without any arbitrary restrictions were included. Out of 103 retrieved articles, 22 were included in the study. Retrieved trials included a total of 162, 936 patients with a mean age of 58. 8  ±  7. 9  years. Prevalence of reported comorbid diabetes and hypertension were 27. 7 % and 36. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{response}} rates among patients with {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD) treated with either moclobemide, an antidepressant thought to simultaneously enhance both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Methods: Using a random-effects model, we combined 12 trials involving 1207 outpatients with MDD. Results: Patients treated with moclobemide were as likely to experience clinical response as those treated with SSRIs (risk ratio 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 92 to 1. 26; P = 0. 314). Simply pooling {{response rates}} for the 2 agents resulted in a 62. 1 % response rate for moclobemide and a 57. 5 % response rate for the SSRIs. A metaregression did not reveal a statistically significant relation between the mean moclobemide dosage for each study and the risk ratio for response rates. Further, we found {{no difference between the}} 2 treatments in overall <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> due to adverse events, or <b>discontinuation</b> <b>rates</b> due to lack of efficacy. Also, rates of fatigue or somnolence and of insomnia were similar between the 2 treatment groups. However, SSRI treatment was associated with higher rates of nausea, headaches, and treatment-emergent anxiety than was treatment with moclobemide. Conclusions: These results suggest that moclobemide and the SSRIs do differ with respect to their side effect profiles but not in their overall efficacy in the treatment of MDD.
