5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins of the Western {{world were}} minted {{in the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E
5|$|Trials {{conducted}} using a conventional, powered C-47, first conducting ordinary deadstick landings, then being towed by another C-47, {{indicated that the}} scheme was feasible. Therefore, a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider, which was given the designation XCG-17. The aircraft, formerly a Northwest Airlines DC-3 that had been impressed into military service {{at the start of}} World War II, was modified by the removal of the aircraft's engines; the nacelles, containing the landing gear, remained in place, covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining, containing <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> to compensate for the removal of the engines. Other equipment, no longer necessary with the conversion to an unpowered configuration, was also removed to save weight; items removed included the aircraft's wiring and bulkheads, along with the navigator's and radio operator's positions.|$|E
2500|$|An {{inclined}} plane {{consists of a}} cradle (to hold a barge) or caisson (a box full of water in which a barge can float) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other. Since the box is [...] "wet" [...] (filled with water), Archimedes' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same, regardless {{of the size of}} boat being carried (or even if it contains only water). This makes for easy counterbalancing by a <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> or by a second caisson. The motive power may be steam or hydraulic, or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway.|$|E

Let us {{suppose a}} {{national}} store of wealth, composed of material things either useful, or {{believed to be}} so, taken charge of by the Government,[18] and that every workman, having produced any article involving labour in its production, and for which he has no immediate use, brings it to add to this store, receiving from the Government, in exchange, an order either {{for the return of}} the thing itself, or of its equivalent in other things, such as he may choose out of the store, at any time when he needs them. The question of equivalence itself (how much wine a man is to receive in return for so much corn, or how much coal in return for so much iron) is a quite separate one, which we will examine presently. For the time, let it be assumed that this equivalence has been determined, and that the Government order, in exchange for a <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> of any article (called, suppose a), is either for the return of that weight of the article itself, or of another <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> of the article b, or another of the article c, and so on.|$|E

60|$|The yams--except {{those for}} {{five of the}} lads, whose {{maintenance}} some of the inhabitants had undertaken--were matter of purchase, and formed the means of instruction in the rules of lawful exchange. A <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> of yams were to constitute prepayment {{for a pair of}} trousers, a piece of calico, a blanket, tomahawk, or the like, and all this was agreed to, Cho being a great assistance in explaining and dealing with his people. But it proved very difficult to keep them up to bringing a sufficient supply, and as they had a full share of the universal spirit of haggling, the commissariat was a very harassing and troublesome business, and as to the boys, it was evident that the experiment was not successful. Going to New Zealand was seeing the world. Horses, cows, sheep, a town, soldiers, &c., were to be seen there, whereas Lifu offered little that they could not see at home, and schooling without novelty was tedious. Indeed, the sight of civilised life, the being taken to church, the kindness of the friends around the College, were no slight engines in their education; but the Lifu people were not advanced enough to serve as an example--except that they had renounced the more horrible of their heathen habits. They were in that unsettled state which is peculiarly trying in the conversion of nations, when the old authoritative customs have been overthrown, and the Christian rules not established.|$|E

In literature, neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and matrix factorization are two common methods used in recommender systems. In this paper, we combine these two methods with personalized weights on them. Rather than using <b>fixed</b> <b>weights</b> for these two methods, we assume each user has her/his own preference over them. Our results shows that our algorithm outperforms neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithm, matrix factorization algorithm and their combination with <b>fixed</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of virtual}} error sensing is {{to project the}} {{localised}} zone of attenuation away from the error sensor, to a location where sound attenuation is desired, such as at an observerâ€™s ear. Forward difference projection is a virtual sensing technique that employs an array {{of at least two}} microphones with <b>fixed</b> <b>weights,</b> calculated using either a linear or quadratic prediction. These prediction methods have shown promise in simulations, but in real-time control the prediction accuracy has been compromised by phase and sensitivity mismatches between the sensors, as well as the excitation of higher-order modes driven off-resonance. A possible solution to the problem is to take these sources of error into account when calculating the <b>fixed</b> <b>weights,</b> by using an adaptive LMS algorithm. This done by placing a microphone at the intended location of the zone of quiet and using an LMS algorithm to adapt the weights applied to the signal at each microphone in the prediction array until the optimal weights are determined. This paper will investigate the effect of phase and sensitivity mismatchand the presence of higher-order modes on the prediction accuracy of the <b>fixed</b> <b>weights</b> prediction method and the effectiveness of the LMS algorithm in compensating for these errors...|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Wassenberg et al. {{developed}} an algorithm that computes multiple independent Minimum Spanning Forests and then stitches them together. This enables parallel processing without splitting objects on tile borders. Instead of a <b>fixed</b> <b>weight</b> threshold, an initial connected-component labeling {{is used to}} estimate a lower bound on the threshold, which can reduce both over- and undersegmentation. Measurements show that the implementation outperforms Felzenszwalb's sequential algorithm by an order of magnitude.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{a robotic}} neurocontroller {{architecture}} that handles delayed response tasks, which {{are characterized by}} a significant (and typically varying) delay between a stimulus and the corresponding appropriate response, is proposed. That is, the architecture aims at memorization and counting tasks. Current controller architectures use supervised (eg. gradient descent), reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms for this class of learning tasks. However, gradient descent methods have serious limitations such as being unable to handle memory very well, whereas supervised and reinforcement learning require a priori knowledge which might not always be available. Approaches for evolution of ANN as a controller includes evolution of initial weights, evolution of learning rules and evolving <b>fixed</b> <b>weights.</b> In this paper, initial and <b>fixed</b> <b>weights</b> are used for evolution of response and delay tasks...|$|R

The pendulum swings back and forth in tempo, while a mechanism inside the metronome produces a clicking sound with each oscillation.
