25|$|I.K. Dairo's musical career {{entered the}} <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> when he founded a ten piece band called the Morning Star Orchestra in 1957. In 1960, during {{the celebration of}} Nigeria's independence, the band was called on to play at a party hosted by a popular Ibadan based lawyer and {{politician}} Chief D O A Oguntoye. With a lot of prominent Yoruba patrons at the venue, I.K. Dairo showcased his style of jùjú music and earned attention and admiration from other Yoruba patrons present, many of whom later invited him to gigs during cultural celebrations or just lavish parties. In the early 1960s, he changed the band's name to Blue Spots and he also won a competition televised in Western Nigeria to showcase the various talents in jùjú music. During the period, {{he was able to}} form his own record label in collaboration with Haruna Ishola and achieved critical and popular acclaim and fame.|$|E
25|$|The race {{restarted}} {{at the end}} of lap {{three with}} Rosenqvist being forced to defend first place from Lynn after losing fraction in his tyres from driving behind the safety car. Lynn steered to the outside of Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner and turned in to take over the lead. Félix da Costa overtook Auer for third on the run up to Mandarin Oriental bend, and Auer lost a further place to Marciello at Lisboa turn. Auer then crashed heavily into the barriers at San Francisco bend while defending from Derani, ending his race early. Shortly after Jones hit a bump going off the racing line at Fisherman's Bend and made contact with the wall. Yellow flags were waved in the area but were withdrawn after he was removed from the circuit. Up front Lynn continued to lead Rosenqvist while Félix da Costa was being hounded by Marciello for third. Similarly King was battling Sims for fifth with Coletti, Buller and Ocon running in close formation in a battle for sixth. Mason was handed a drive-through penalty after his team started his engine while stationary in the <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane. Sims managed to get ahead of King for fifth and began closing up to Derani. Buller overtook Coletti while Sainz passed Korjus for eleventh. On the fifth lap and heading towards Lisboa corner, Marciello moved in front of Félix da Costa for third.|$|E
25|$|The second {{qualifying}} session began {{fifteen minutes}} later than scheduled due to freight for the Guia Race of Macau being stranded in Beijing, and was further delayed by crashes in the local touring car support races. When the session did start, Jarvis set the early pace before he was eclipsed by Tsukakoshi one minute before the conclusion of second qualifying. This was immediately bettered by Jarvis with a lap of two minutes and 11.696 which he held to secure pole position for the qualifying race. Amser set his best time on his last lap to join Jarvis on {{the front row of}} the grid. Tsukakoshi was 0.216 seconds adrift in third place. Buemi remained in fourth position with Mortara moving up four positions to fifth. Grosjean's effort in second qualifying dropped him to sixth overall while teammate Kobayashi similarly lost ground and could only manage seventh. The top ten was completed by Oshima, Streit and Buurman. Behind them {{the rest of the field}} consisted of Jakes, Guerrieri, Jelley, Van Dam, Hülkenberg, Bird, Breen, Senna, Kennard, Mustonen, Hartley, Mailleux, Van Der Zande, Izawa, Ho, Ávila, Grubmüller, Lou Meng, Kit Meng and Merszei. The session was halted three times: firstly for Van Der Zande who crashed into the barriers leaving Paiol corner and debris was littered across the track. Hartley was the cause of the second stoppage when he impacted the wall at the exit of Lisboa turn and his car was stranded in a dangerous position. The final stoppage was for Grubmüller who went into the barriers on his out-lap. Buemi and Buurman each received penalties after second qualifying: Buemi was summoned to the stewards office for a review of his fastest lap and they felt his attempt was recorded under yellow flag conditions. Thus, Buemi was demoted five places on the grid. Buurman dropped three positions after he was adjudged to move into the <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane before it was declared open.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unclear}} how the {{introduction}} of "fast lanes" would affect {{the evolution of the}} Internet. While this is with no doubt an important issue, we do not aim to address this question. Instead, in this work we study the interaction between an internet service provider and one or more content providers when such <b>fast</b> <b>lanes</b> are allowed. Each entity is considered a player in a game, and it is assumed that these players are both rational and selfish, i. e., they aim to maximize their own gains. Clearly, their objectives are different, and their bargaining powers may vary. We examine how they may reach an agreement and how their interaction affects the resulting quality-of-service on the <b>fast</b> <b>lanes.</b> To get {{a better understanding of the}} kind of contract these entities may be willing to sign we look at two cases: (i) a monopoly market that has one internet service provider and one content provider and (ii) one where an extra content provider enters the market. Our findings show that, in the case of a monopoly market, an efficient contract can be reached in Stackelberg games, which maximizes the aggregate payoff of both the providers. Similarly, when another content provider enters the market, the entity with the strongest bargaining power chooses a contract that maximizes the aggregate payoff of all providers...|$|R
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and was similarly timed to the previous day's session. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Asmer {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 13.122 seconds set nine minutes remaining in the session. The heavy damage to Grosjean's car forced him to sit out the session's opening minutes and gradually improved to be two-tenths adrift of Asmer and settled for provisionally second. Despite clipping the wall Yelmer Buurman ran strongly throughout and finished in third place with Buemi battling for pole position {{for the majority of the}} session until he dropped to fourth. Esteban Guerrieri made an improvement late on to end up fifth in front of Tsukakoshi in sixth and 2006 pole sitter Kamui Kobayashi stood in seventh. James Jakes, Streit and Jelley rounded out the top ten. Although he was at one point high up as fourth in the time sheets Jarvis was the quickest driver not to reach the top ten. Following him were the highest placed rookie Mortara, Oshima with Hülkenberg provisionally joining the Japanese driver on the seventh row in spite of him glancing the tyre barriers at Lisboa corner. Niall Breen was next up ahead of Atte Mustonen, Jonathan Kennard, Van Dam, Renger van der Zande and Senna. The rest of the order was completed Bird, Mailleux, Hartley, Grubmüller, Takuya Izawa, Ávila, Ho, Kit Meng. Cheong Lou Meng and the only driver to fail to record within 110% of Asmer was Merszei. Other incidents that occurred during first qualifying were Mustonen damaging his suspension against the tyre wall and Bird went into the barrier at Fisherman's Bend. Senna then crashed into the tyre barriers at San Francisco Bend and then was impacted by Izawa which prompted the waving of the red flags. After qualifying, numerous penalties were handed out. Kobayashi and Mutstonen were given three-place grid penalties for moving into the <b>fast</b> <b>lane</b> of the pit lane before it was declared open. Hülkenberg and Lou Meng were similarly penalised for ignoring the red light signal at the end of the pit lane which mandated them to enter the weighbridge.|$|E

30|$|Lane {{changing}} algorithms add {{a necessary}} level of complexity to the IDM. In order {{to decide whether}} to change lane or not, the current acceleration must be calculated for the current lane and the acceleration in the new lane (with regard to the car behind and in front in the original lane). If the acceleration in the new lane is greater than that in the current lane, there is an advantage to be gained by changing lane. Many models, including those in the original simulator, include a bias in the model for particular lanes, which simulates the real scenario of slow <b>lanes</b> and <b>fast</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
