Based on this role, vetiver was nomenclature in Amharic as Yeserdo Sar Mekelakeya (Coach Grass Barrier). Systematic efforts to develop Vetiver Grass Technology (VGT) for soil and water conservation were first initiated by the Ex- Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development (MCTD) in the South West Coffee Growing areas in the early 1990 ’s, taking cue from Thailand and Indian experiences.

The second objective is to describe community member 2 ̆ 7 s concerns and conflicts relating to the marine environment. This information was primarily collected through a survey questionnaire. The third objective is to analyze the relationship between the socioeconomic and environmental perception variables.

It is hypothesized that variance in environmental attitudes, beliefs and values will be related to different community sectors (e. g. fishermen, farmers, etc.). Identification of the correlates of this variance can be used to produce recommendations and projects which will more effectively achieve sustainability within the region. Efforts such as this have provided valid in other natural resource management projects (Pollnac 1990; Well and White 1990). Major recommendations which are supported by the research results include providing institution building for CEBSE and providing the community with the ability to improve the fishing and tourist industries.

They are broad topics. Eco efficiency philosophy aims decreasing usage amount of energy, water, raw materials during production cycle without decreasing quality of produced products. Because of less energy, water and raw material usage it provides environmental productivity (less pollution). Clean production, philosophically serves similar purpose. Clean production is minimizing {{the amount of waste}} on source of waste. It deals with eco design, good purification, and environmental friendly production processes. Diminishing amount of waste and pollution provides environmental productivity but also it provides economic productivity because of decreasing waste treatment cost. These subjects are generally linked with environmental sciences because they are about diminishing occurrence amount of waste and waste treatment. But also those subjects are related with productivity (industrial engineering). In this study, an industrial engineering subject which is Facility Layout is reviewed as a tool for eco efficiency and clean production.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns arising from rapid growth of tourism in the developing countries is how to plan the destinations appropriately to optimize equitable benefits to local communities, and reduce adverse impacts of tourism. Fortress conservation, a conventional approach of protected area (PA) planning, is generally criticized to be ineffective, unethical, and non-local oriented (Lai & Nepal, 2006), and failed to improve the livelihoods of local residents living in or around the protected areas (PAs). The externally imposed rules and regulations on the PAs {{in many developing countries}} have resulted relocation of local people, limited their accessibility to resources and often created conflicts between PA authorities and local people (Nepal & Weber, 1995). In this situation, to enhance development of local communities vis-a-vis conservation of resources both natural and cultural, an alternative benign approach to tourism, generally known as ecotourism, is widely advocated as a comprehensive tool. However, how such destinations should be planned properly to enhance community well-being and sustainability has not yet been extensively elaborated specifically in context of Nepal. This paper thus critically reviews the theories of (<b>eco)</b> tourism <b>development</b> and planning with respect to the general context of developing countries, and further discusses on the linkage between ecotourism and sustainable community development. The review of four international cases, along with the discussion with local residents in the Annapurna Sanctuary Trail, and Sagarmatha National Park of Nepal, as well as interview with policy makers and ecotourism experts in Nepal, this paper concludes an approach of Community-oriented Collaborative (Co-C) ecotourism planning as appropriate to promote sustainable community development in the PAs of Nepal.

40|$|The {{issues of}} {{ecotourism}} development in Malaysia, which could benefit the local communities in remote areas, were rarely {{mentioned in the}} federal government’s tourism policies. The issues that were mentioned are often limited to factors such as supplementing income in (eco) tourism activities which {{was regarded as a}} priority, but never beyond that. This was the dilemma in the early phase of the implementation in the 1990 s of sustainable (<b>eco)</b> tourism <b>development</b> in Malaysia, particularly in the state of Sabah. This is a qualitative research approach or specifically case study approach based on the critical theory paradigm or perspectives. Two villages were observed in this research: namely Batu Puteh village and Sukau village. These villages are located in the floodplain of Lower Kinabatangan River. This area is an extremely important site for ecotourism in Sabah and/or Malaysia: especially through ecotourists activities such as river boating, jungle trekking and wildlife viewing. The local people generally known as “orang sungai” (the river people) have recently participated in many aspects of ecotourism activities such as tourist guides, conservation volunteers, tourist lodges workers, homestay providers etc. Thus the main issues for these villages are: to what extent does ecotourism development in Batu Puteh and/or Sukau village have positive and negative impacts on the socio-cultural life of the local community? How and why are the local communities involved directly or indirectly in ecotourism development? To what extent has ecotourism development increased the level of participation, and improved the standard of living of the local community? To what extent can ecotourism be considered a potential instrument for rural economic development and/or environmental conservation to achieve sustainable development in the destination areas? These issues will be explored thoroughly in this research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
