40|$|Nanoporous low-k dielectrics {{are used}} for {{integrated}} circuit interconnects to reduce the propagation delays, and cross talk noise between metal wires as an alternative material for SiO 2. These materials, typically organosilicate glass (OSG) films, are exposed to oxygen plasmas during photoresist stripping and related processes which substantially damage the film by abstracting carbon, incorporating O and OH, eventually leading to significantly increased k values. Systematic studies have been performed to understand the oxygen plasma-induced damage mechanisms on different low-k OSG films of various porosity and pore interconnectedness. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to understand the damage kinetics of O radicals, ultraviolet photons and charged species, and possible ways to control the carbon loss from the film. FTIR results demonstrate that O radical present in the plasma is primarily responsible for carbon abstraction and this is governed by diffusion mechanism involving <b>interconnected</b> <b>film</b> nanopores.

40|$|Abstract—Thermal cycling {{is widely}} used as a {{qualification}} test in the microelectronic industry. This paper investigates an intriguing failure mode observed in such a test. Near the corners of a silicon die, shear stresses arise due to thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon and the packaging substrate. These shear stresses may have a small magnitude, being transmitted through packaging polymers, but sometimes motivate metallic <b>interconnect</b> <b>films</b> to crawl {{toward the center of}} the die during thermal cycling, even when the temperatures are low and the metal creeps negligibly. The phenomenon has been observed for two decades, but no mechanistic explanation has been given so far. This paper shows that the metal films can crawl by ratcheting plastic deformation. When the temperature cycles, the thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon and the metal causes the metal films to yield. Directed by the small shear stresses, the films shear plastically by a small amount in each cycle, and accumulate a large deformation after many cycles. We develop an idealized model to demonstrate this mechanism, and to study the effects of temperature-dependent yield strength and strain hardening. Several analytical solutions are obtained. Implications for the qualification test and interconnect design are discussed. The study clearly shows the need for basic research on large plastic deformation a...|$|R

40|$|We present experimented results {{directed}} at understanding {{the growth and}} structure of metallic barrier layer and <b>interconnect</b> <b>films.</b> Numerical simulation results associated with this experimental work are presented in an accompanying paper in these proceedings. Here, thin films of Al, Ti, Cu and Ta have been grown by magnetron sputtering onto oxidized Si substrates. Using a specially-constructed substrate holder, {{the orientation of the}} substrate with respect to the growth direction was varied from horizontal to vertical. Films were grown at both low and high argon pressure; in the case of Ta, the cathode power was varied as well. The film structure and in particular the surface roughness was measured by X-ray reflectance and also by atomic force microscopy. We find that the surface roughness increases markedly with orientation angle in the case of Ta and Cu films, and in Ti films grown at high argon pressure. At low pressure, however, the Ti film surface roughness remains constant for all substrate orientations. No variation in roughness with either orientation angle or argon pressure was observed in the Al films. These results suggest that, under certain circumstances, shadowing effects and/or grain orientation (i. e., texture) competition during growth can give rise to lower density, more porous (and thus more rough) films, particularly at large orientation angles, as on sidewalls in sub-micron trenches...|$|R

I conducted subsolidus creep tests on mixtures of ice and magnesium perchlorate hexahydrate (MP 6) of 0. 02, 0. 05, 0. 10, and 0. 47 volume fraction MP 6. I found these mixtures to be increasingly weak with increasing MP 6 content. For mixtures with </= 0. 10 volume fraction MP 6, I resolved a stress exponent of n ~~ 2 at low stresses transitioning to n ~~ 4 above 10 MPa. Scanning electron microscopy of deformed specimens revealed MP 6 to be distributed as an <b>interconnected</b> <b>film</b> between ice grains. These results suggest that grain boundary sliding (GBS) may be enhanced with respect to pure ice. As the enhancement of GBS is expected in polycrystalline aggregates containing a few percent melt or otherwise weak material distributed along grain boundaries, the observed n~~ 2 {{is consistent with the}} mutual accommodation of basal slip and GBS. If ice containing trace concentrations of MP 6 is also much weaker than pure ice at low stresses, flow in the NPLD could be significantly enhanced, particularly at the warmer basal temperatures associated with higher Martian obliquities. by Hendrik J.

40|$|International audienceModelling of drying {{processes}} without {{adjustable parameters}} {{is still a}} challenge. As emphasized in several previous works, this might partly {{be due to the}} impact of liquid films trapped in corners of the pore space. In this study, we present and analyse a drying experiment with a micromodel, which clearly shows the presence of corner films. In contrast with previous works, however, the corner films do not form a system of <b>interconnected</b> corner <b>films</b> extending over large regions in our micromodel. They rather form isolated capillary rings surrounding the solid blocks of the device, and thus, a quasi-two-dimensional version of liquid bridges often observed in the contact regions between grains in soils and packings of particles. These capillary rings essentially remain confined in the two-phase region. As a result, their impact on drying rate is much smaller than in systems favouring films hydraulically connected over long distances. The capillary liquid ring formation is taken into account in a pore network model of drying leading to satisfactory agreement with the experiment provided that the lateral pinning of liquid phase observed in the experiment is included in the model. Based on this, the model enriches the family of pore network models of drying and can be considered as a step towards the modelling of secondary capillary effects in drying in more complex geometry...|$|R

However, these aspects have hardly been investigated. We induced controlled levels of protein and lipid oxidation using whey protein solution and sunflower oil as substrates, respectively. The adsorption kinetics, surface activity, and dilatational interfacial rheology of whey proteins at the sunflower oil-water interface were investigated using a drop tensiometer. Both protein and lipid oxidation led to a decrease in interfacial elasticity compared to the non-oxidized samples, though through different pathways: protein oxidation led to {{a broad range of}} proteinaceous species, including peptides and aggregates, which did not form an interconnected network. Lipid oxidation induced the formation of surface active compounds, which presumably formed segregated domains at the interface. Practical applications: Oxidative reactions prevent whey proteins to form strong, viscoelastic layers at the oil-water interface. This could, in turn, drastically affect their ability to stabilize food emulsions. These findings suggest that considering the initial oxidative state of ingredients should {{be an integral part of}} food emulsion formulation.

40|$|Polymer {{molecules}} when physically confined at nanometer {{length scales}} diffuse nonclassically and very differently {{depending on their}} molecular weight {{and the nature of}} the confinement. Long polymers that exhibit “snakelike ” reptation based mobility in melts may diffuse faster in confined nanometer sized cylinders with pore diameter d ∼ 15 nm, and short polymers subject to Rouse dynamics have shown signatures of reptation and slower diffusion when confined in nanoporous glass with d ∼ 4 nm. However, the mobility of short polymers with radii of gyration similar to a smaller pore diameter (d e 2. 1 nm) but with extended lengths well larger than the pore diameter has not as yet been studied. In this work, we demonstrate that those short molecules including nonionic surfactants can readily diffuse in strongly hydrophobic nanoporous glasses film with d e 2. 1 nm. The diffusivity was found sensitive to molecular weight, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance, and molecular structure of surfactants. Remarkably, analysis of the measured diffusion coefficients reveals that short-chain surfactants exhibit signature of reptation based diffusion in the nanoscopic pore confinements. Such reptation mobility in agreement with theoretical predictions is not even observed in reptating polymer melts due to fluctuations of the entanglement pathway. The fixed pathways in the <b>interconnected</b> nanoporous <b>films</b> provide ideal nanoscale environments to explore mobility of confined molecules, and the results have implications for a number of technologies where nanoporous materials are in contact with surfactant molecules.

In this case, when CaCl 2 was added in GO dispersion, CaCO 3 particles were formed on GO sheets, in which CaCO 3 were used as template to create a macroporous structure [18].

The electrochemical performance was further increased by performing polymerization of aniline on 3 -D RGO films [18]. This resulting 3 -D RGO/polyaniline (PANI) electrode possessed significantly improved capacitance up to 385  F/g at 0.5  A/g because of high pseudocapacitance contribution of PANI based upon its redox reactions [18].

40|$|Viability for the {{development}} of an engineered geothermal system (EGS) in the oilsands region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, is investigated by studying the structure of the Precambrian basement rocks with magnetotellurics (MT). MT data were collected at 94 broad-band stations on two east–west profiles. Apparent resistivity and phase data showed little variation along each profile. The short period MT data detected a 1 -D resistivity structure that could be identified as the shallow sedimentary basin underlain by crystalline basement rocks to a depth of 4 – 5 [*]km. At lower frequencies a strong directional dependence, large phase splits, and regions of out-of-quadrant (OOQ) phase were detected. 2 -D isotropic inversions of these data failed to produce a realistic resistivity model. A detailed dimensionality analysis found links between large phase tensor skews (∼ 15 °), azimuths, OOQ phases and tensor decomposition strike angles at periods greater than 1 s. Low magnitude induction vectors, as well as uniformity of phase splits and phase tensor character between the northern and southern profiles imply that a 3 -D analysis is not necessary or appropriate. Therefore, 2 -D anisotropic forward modelling was used to generate a resistivity model to interpret the MT data. The preferred model was based on geological observations of outcropping anisotropic mylonitic basement rocks of the Charles Lake shear zone, 150 km to the north, linked to the study area by aeromagnetic and core sample data. This model fits all four impedance tensor elements with an rms misfit of 2. 82 on the southern profile, and 3. 3 on the northern.

Rigorous multiscale physical models and numerical tools have been developed and used to reproduce electrochemical properties of carbon-based electrochemical capacitors with the ultimate objective of facilitating the optimization of electrode design. For the organic photovoltaic (OPV) program, our focus has been ongoing beyond the trial-and-error Edisonian approaches that have been responsible for the increase in power conversion efficiency of blend-cast (BC) bulk heterojunction blends of polymers and fullerenes. Our first approach has been to use molecular self-assembly to create the ideal nanometer-scale architecture using thermodynamics rather than relying on the kinetics of spontaneous phase segregation. We have created fullerenes that self-assemble into one-dimensional stacks and have shown that use of these self-assembled fullerenes lead to dramatically enhanced OPV performance relative to fullerenes that do not assemble. We also have created self-assembling conjugated polymers that form gels based on electrically continuous cross-linked micelles in solution, opening the possibility for water-processable "green" production of OPVs based on these materials. Our second approach has been to avoid kinetic control over phase separation by using a sequential processing (SqP) technique to deposit the polymer and fullerene materials in separate deposition steps. The polymer layer is deposited first, using solvents and deposition conditions that optimize the polymer crystallinity for swelling and hole mobility. The fullerene layer is then deposited in a second step from a solvent that swells the polymer but does not dissolve it, allowing the fullerene to penetrate into the polymer underlayer to the desired degree. Careful comparison of composition- and thickness-matched BC and SqP devices shows that SqP not only produces more efficient devices but also leads to devices that behave more consistently. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R
