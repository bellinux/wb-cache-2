Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> the investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and {{pushing for a}} finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> the investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E

In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> final examinations.

40|$|The place {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has been}} used to assess the antinausea potential of drugs in non-emetic animal species. The present experiments were designed to determine the potential of A 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate both conditioned and unconditioned sickness in rats (Rattus norvegiens). The results in the present study suggest that when the place aversion is strong (Experiment 1), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment; however when the aversion is weak (Experiments 2 and 3), THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the expression. Also, when administered during acquisition of a strong amphetamine-induced place preference, THC also seems to <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the establishment of the preference. Therefore it appears that when the place association is strong, THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the associative process itself, but when the place association is weak THC may <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the conditioned sickness or the retrieval of the association...|$|R
5|$|Humberto {{continued}} to intensify {{on the morning}} of the 23rd as the central dense overcast became well defined, despite the lack of a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret <b>interfered</b> <b>with</b> the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Immunotherapy is a {{promising}} {{strategy in the}} fight against cancer, based on the mechanism of action of T cells. However tumors have developed several ways to evade this strategy. This is done by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic cascade, used by T cells to kill tumor cells. This can be done by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> molecules involved in the apoptotic cascade or by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> regulators of the apoptotic cascade or, by <b>interfering</b> <b>with</b> regulators of regulators of the apoptotic cascade. This interference leads to a reduced sensitivity to CTL mediated lysis or even to a complete resistance against CTL mediated lysis...|$|R
