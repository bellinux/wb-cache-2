500|$|Although forty-four {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinced his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 22.878. He was joined on the grid's front row by Montoya. Newman qualified third, Biffle took fourth and Reutimann started fifth. Kahne, Gordon, Bowyer, Sam Hornish, Jr. and Paul Menard completed the top ten positions. The driver that failed to qualify was Scott Wimmer. During qualifying, Elliott Sadler's changed his car's engine, after one failed during the session. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "A pole today will make the start of the weekend much better and give us a lot of direction and momentum moving into tomorrow, It does carry you, and there is an aspect of momentum. But at the same time, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and perform." ...|$|E
500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, [...] "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...' Maybe I don't feel like having a nice day. Maybe, just maybe, I've had 116nice days in a row and I'm ready, by God, for a crappy day." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2001, Sheets {{had been}} {{promoted}} to the Brewers' starting rotation. His first two starts resulted in losses, but he won his next four, while pitching to a 1.73 ERA. On May 29, in his ninth career start, he pitched his first shutout, giving up 5 hits against the St. Louis Cardinals. [...] He ended the season 11–10 with a 4.76 ERA. In 2003, Sheets was troubled by bulging discs in his lower back. [...] "My back has been hurt but you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and perform," [...] he said. Over the final two months of the season, Sheets pitched poorly and finished the year 11–13 with a 4.45 ERA.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} {{game of the}} season, a 29-6 victory over the Oakland Raiders, Slaton fumbled {{for the fourth time}} in four games. He was {{temporarily}} benched during the game, but rebounded with a 32-yard touchdown run - his first score of the season, finishing with 65 yards rushing and 24 yards receiving and another touchdown via a reception. In the following game, a loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Slaton rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries and caught 6 passes for 59 yards. In the press conference following the game, Gary Kubiak expressed his displeasure with the running game and Slaton, saying, [...] "If we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and throw it all the time, that's what we'll do." [...] On November 8, 2009, Slaton was benched in favor of Ryan Moats. On December 9, Slaton was put on the Injured Reserve due to a shoulder injury.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, or what I hope my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} did have them, and some day {{he may be}} able to prove it," [...] answered Jack warmly. [...] "On the very night that you fellows <b>got</b> us <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> that storehouse he was knocked down in one of our rooms by two or three men and the papers were taken from him. And what is more, I am pretty sure in my mind that the fellows who took them were Davenport and his partners." ...|$|R
60|$|At last he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> his feet, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of the room, {{reached the}} doorway of that other room and looked in. Mr. Bentley sat there; and the woman, whose tears had ceased to flow, was looking up into his face.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I can't {{think of}} those things yet," [...] he mused, as he {{finished}} his dinner. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the world first, get into business, and prove my worth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{soon as the}} {{questioning}} was over, I made the first excuse that came into my head, and <b>got</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> for {{a breath of fresh}} air. I <b>went</b> straight <b>to</b> Cobb's Hole, to Mr. Yolland's cottage. His wife and daughter were the best friends I had. Don't suppose I trusted them with your secret--I have trusted nobody. All I wanted was to write this letter to you, and to have a safe opportunity of taking the nightgown off me. Suspected as I was, I could do neither of those things with any sort of security, at the house.|$|R
60|$|We had {{our early}} dinner, and then <b>got</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> walking as usual. These pages contain a true confession. Let me own that I hoped Mr. Sax would {{understand}} my refusal, and ask Mrs. Fosdyke's leave to accompany us. Lingering {{a little as}} we went downstairs, I heard him in the hall--actually speaking to Mrs. Fosdyke! What was he saying? That darling boy, Freddy, got into a difficulty {{with one of his}} boot-laces exactly at the right moment. I could help him, and listen--and be sadly disappointed by the result. Mr. Sax was offended with me.|$|R
60|$|The next batter's {{attempts}} {{were not as}} awkward as Ken's, still they were as futile. As Ken sat wearily down upon the bench he happened to get next to coach Arthurs. He expected some sharp words from the coach, he thought he deserved anything, {{but they were not}} forthcoming. The coach put his hand on Ken's knee. When the third batter fouled to Hickle, and Ken <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the field, he summoned courage to look at Arthurs. Something in his face told Ken what an ordeal this was. He divined that it was vastly more than business with Worry Arthurs.|$|R

60|$|One morning Karlsefin gave {{orders for}} one of the {{exploring}} parties <b>to</b> be <b>got</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> immediately. Karlsefin's plan from the beginning had been to class his men in two divisions. One half stayed at home to work, the other half searched the land,--always taking care, however, not to travel so far but that they could return home in the evening. They were careful also not to wander far from each other. Sometimes Karlsefin went with the exploring party, at other times stayed at home to superintend the work there, while Biarne or Thorward filled his place. On the occasion in question Biarne was in charge.|$|R
25|$|The sergeants were of {{interest}} to SHAI since they belonged to the field security unit and worked with the Tulkarm police, which {{was in charge of}} the Sharon district. Their mission was to circulate within the local population and pick up information on the Irgun and Lehi and their supporters. They often operated in civilian clothes and were not subject to standing orders intended to prevent abduction attempts. Notably, they did not have to leave camp in groups of four, and sometimes went unarmed. Weinberg was very successful in his task, and occasionally <b>got</b> the sergeants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Netanya beach.|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Johnson, {{who plays}} the character, says that Kick-Ass is a [...] "sensitive guy" [...] who lost his mother and is a [...] "nobody" [...] at school, so he creates his superhero {{identity}} [...] "as this whole different persona." [...] Johnson said that Dave is [...] "a kid who’s <b>got</b> the guts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and do something different." [...] In preparation for the role, Johnson received fitness and stunt training, and {{did a couple of}} weeks of doing fight choreography. He also requires a dialect coach for the American accent to suit the character.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the pair}} drew nearer, Harold overheard Disco's persuasive voice:--"Come now, Antonio, don't be a fool; it's the best service you could enter. Good pay and hard work, {{and all the}} grub that's goin'-- what could a man want more? It's true there's no grog, but we don't need that in a climate where you've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in the sun without yer hat an' you'll {{be as good as}} drunk in ten minutes, any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have to {{work all}} night, both of you--that's your {{punishment}} for disobeying orders--and without the solace of a pipe too," [...] said Mark, when order was somewhat restored and work resumed. [...] "The garden party, you know, is fixed for to-morrow, and it's as much as our heads are worth to disappoint the Queen of her expected amusements. Time, tide, and Ranavalona the First wait for no man! I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{for an hour or}} so.

I'll have to come back on the three o'clock train and hurry out to catch my politician before he leaves at five. Take a stroll down to meet my train, Patty. We can go out as far as Mr. Reid's house together, and the walk will do you good." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 3d of June.--Our {{stories are}} ended; our {{pleasant}} work is done. It {{is a lovely}} summer afternoon. The great hall at the farmhouse, after having been filled with people, is now quite deserted. I sit alone at my little work-table, with rather a crying sensation at my heart, and with the pen trembling in my fingers, as if I was an old woman already. Our manuscript has been sealed up and taken away; the one precious object of all our most anxious thoughts for months past--our third child, as we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> call it--has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> from us on this summer's day, to seek its fortune in the world.|$|R

[...] "I can get away for dinner that is, but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in the evening. It's a bore, but I promised to be at Lady McMarshal's to-night.

The {{distance}} is a good deal farther {{than it would have been}} if we had started at first; but it isn't the distance that makes much matter. We've only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> a little way, and the tide will soon take us around the point. Everything depends on you. I can take you round the point, and land you safely enough, if you will lie quiet. If you don't, you will drown both of us. So it's entirely in your hands.|$|E

After that, Rogers goes into the closet door by taking off his {{cardigan}} zipper sweater, and hanging it up, and grabs his jacket to put it back on. Before the closing credits, Rogers <b>got</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> the door by reminding the viewers: [...] "You always make each day a special day.

60|$|Directly {{in front}} of my ward was the dead-house. Thither all the bodies of those who died in the {{hospital}} were regularly carried for dissection. Scarcely one escaped being subjected to the knife. This dead-house stood some eighty, or a hundred, yards from the hospital, and between them was an area, containing a few large trees. I was in the habit, after I <b>got</b> well enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>to</b> hobble to one of these trees, where I would sit for hours, reading and meditating. It was a good place to make a man reflect on the insignificance of worldly things, disease and death being all around him. I frequently saw six or eight bodies carried across this area, while sitting in it, and many were taken to the dead-house, at night. Hundreds, if not thousands, were in the hospital, and a large proportion died.|$|R
