40|$|International audienceTerrestrial isopods can {{be killed}} by some <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> among Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus species even with no or very limited multiplication. This {{suggests}} that toxemia and not septicemia is the major cause of <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> pathogenicity against these crustaceans. In this paper, we revealed that the injection of stationary phase culture supernatant of P. luminescens TT 01, in which toxins can be accumulated, led alone to a rapid {{decrease in the number}} of host immune cells and killed most of the Armadillidium vulgare individuals within 48 h. The pathogenicity was strongly attenuated when supernatant was heated and totally suppressed after 100 -kDa filtration suggesting that the toxin responsible for killing A. vulgare would be a protein above this size. Additionally, we tested the culture supernatant of two TT 01 mutants that have been previously shown as being altered in their pathogenicity against lepidopteran insects one of them being known as exhibiting lower expression of some toxins.

40|$|Aims: To {{develop a}} specific, fast and simple {{molecular}} method useful {{to detect the}} <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Pseudomonas entomophila. Methods and Results: The use of bioinformatics tools allowed the identification of unique genes present in P. entomophila genome. Using such genes, we designed primers aiming to detect specifically P. entomophila by PCR. Furthermore, a pair of primers specifically designed to amplify the 16 S rRNA gene in Pseudomonas species was used. Primer specificity was checked using environmental pseudomonad and nonpseudomonad species. A 618 -bp fragment was amplified only in Pseudomonas using the 16 S rDNA primers. Primers (PSEEN 1497) designed to detect P. entomophila amplified a 570 -bp fragment only in P. entomophila. A duplex PCR was developed combining 16 S rDNA and PSEEN 1497 primers that allowed the detection of P. entomophila present in experimentally infected Drosophila melanogaster. Conclusions: We developed a molecular method useful to detect P. entomophila present in bacterial cultures or directly from infected insects.

40|$|The sugar-feeding {{ecology of}} {{dipteran}} vectors {{has recently been}} targeted because it presents opportunities to inoculate common food sources for these dipterans with <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{as a means of}} controlling the population of host-seeking adult dipteran vectors. Whereas this approach to vector control holds some promise, differences in the nutrient composition and concentration in sugary food sources can influence the food selection pattern of dipteran vectors and potentially confound the outcomes of field trials on the efficacy of <b>entomopathogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> as vector control agents. Further, nutrient components of bacteria-inoculated artificial diets may present unintended effects of extending the survivorship or fecundity of the target population and potentially render the whole approach counterproductive. The present study investigated the diet-specific factors that influence the foraging decisions of female Simulium venustum/verecundum (Diptera: Simuliidae) and female Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) on artificial nectar and honeydew. Paired choice experiments showed that the black flies forage more frequently from high calorie diets, which contained melezitose, or those diets that contained amino acids, compared to low calorie melezitose-free diets or amino acid-free diets. The mosquitoes however displayed a more random diet selection pattern. The effects of sugary diets on certain life-history traits considered to be important to the ecological fitness of the black flies and mosquitoes were also investigated. Sugary diets had no significant effect on the survivorship and fecundity of the black flies, but they influenced the resistance of Leucocytozoon-infected flies to the parasite. Amino acid-containing diets appeared to extend the survival of mosquitoes, and also allowed them to take more vertebrate blood when they blood fed...|$|E
