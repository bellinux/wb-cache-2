5|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Josh {{tries to}} end a deadlock on {{the appointment of a}} 6th Circuit federal court judge. His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to suggest this to Leo he is told that the issue will have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could <b>even</b> <b>begin.</b> Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification theory {{suggests}} that people may begin to shape others' evaluations of them before they <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> interacting with them. They may, for example, display identity cues (see: impression management). The most effective identity cues enable people to signal who they are to potential interaction partners.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{failure to}} reevaluate the current {{paradigm}} {{and recognize that}} both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they <b>even</b> <b>begin.</b>|$|E

25|$|The four survivors, David Kilpatrick a {{passenger}} from Paisley, Renfrewshire, William John Simpson, the 19-year-old apprentice, and nephew of the captain, and two able seamen William Mitchell and Duncan McMillan, had to scale steep cliffs {{before they could}} <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to get help. Kilpatrick was in a fearful state and could not climb up but eventually his companions helped him to the top, cutting his feet badly during the climb.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advancement}} is also {{changing the}} ways news is gathered and edited. The newsreel days are long gone. Reporters {{do not use}} film anymore. Television journalists are capturing images and sound on video and DV. Some stations <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> gathering and reporting news in high-definition television. Even editing and archiving systems are evolving, {{as more and more}} stations convert to non-linear editing systems, and storing file footage on computer servers rather than tapes.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{widespread}} stereotype of gay male speech, but not of lesbian speech. This is because {{a wider range of}} speech styles is more tolerated in women than in men and also is because lesbians have historically been less free to lay claim to the kinds of public space and networks that would provide the means for the establishment and circulation of styles. As such, the study of lesbian speech has been neglected, and linguists who are interested in the topic often have difficulty figuring out where to <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> their research.|$|E

25|$|On 24 November, Kellermann massed 16,000 French {{troops on}} the Duero near Valdestillas. Badly outnumbered, the French {{prepared}} to defend themselves. But on this day the Army of the Left received news of the Oca√±a disaster. Understanding that this dire event meant that the French could spare plenty of soldiers to track down his army, Del Parque bolted to the south, intending to shelter {{in the mountains of}} central Spain. On 25 November, Del Parque slipped away so suddenly that Kellermann did not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> his pursuit until the next day. For two days, the French were unable to catch up with their adversaries. But on the afternoon of 28 November, their light cavalry found the Army of the Left camped at Alba de Tormes.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1952, Garfield {{moved out}} of his New York {{apartment}} for the last time, indicating to friends {{it was not a}} temporary separation from his wife Roberta. He confided to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in Look magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called Taxi, but would not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 2001, Columbia House Television began {{releasing}} I Love Lucy on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and would not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail order subscribers. All these DVDs have the identical features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets in retail.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{features}} of the Saint Petersburg Metro make it stand out amongst others, even those in the former USSR. It is customary to have stations in the centre of a city built very deep, not only to minimise disruption, but also, because of the Cold War threat, they were built to double as bomb shelters, and many old stations do feature provisions such as blast doors and air filters. In most cities, the lines become shallow or <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to run above ground as they reach the city's outer residential districts. However, {{this is not the case}} in Saint Petersburg. The difficult geology means that 56 out of 63 stations are at a deep level. The design and architecture went through numerous phases. The original stations were predominantly of the pylon type, of which there are 15 stations. Also popular was the column layout, and there are 16 such stations in the system.|$|E
25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find another place to play. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Reaction in Britain to Hay's {{appointment}} was generally positive, with George Smalley of The Times writing to him, [...] "we want {{a man who}} is a true American yet not anti-English". Hay secured a Georgian house on Carlton House Terrace, overlooking Horse Guards Parade, with 11 servants. He brought with him Clara, their own silver, two carriages, and five horses. Hay's salary of $17,000 [...] "did not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> {{to cover the cost of}} their extravagant lifestyle".|$|E

500|$|Frank Caron of Ars Technica {{wrote that}} the [...] "massive {{undertaking}} ... stands as a massive success" [...] and that the fan translation realized the dreams of many gamers including his own. He added that [...] "one cannot <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to fathom" [...] why Nintendo would not release their own English localization. Kotaku Mike Fahey wrote that {{he felt that the}} translators were wrong to suggest purchasing official merchandise where players were unable to find an import copy. The Verge cited the two-year fan translation of Mother 3 as proof of the fan base's dedication.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo {{is often}} criticized for Mother 3 {{lack of an}} {{international}} release. IGN referred to the Mother series as [...] "neglected" [...] in regards to EarthBound being the only game to be released outside Japan. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com wrote of Mother 3 that [...] "no other game {{in the history of}} time garnered such a rabid demand for translation," [...] and Chris Plante of UGO Networks wrote that the lack of an official Mother 3 English localization was one of 2008's [...] "worst heartbreaks". Frank Caron of Ars Technica said that the fan translation's [...] "massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success" [...] and that [...] "one cannot <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to fathom why Nintendo wouldn't see fit to release the game in the West." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{prior to}} the Browns' announcement, rumors of the NFL's {{impending}} return had been enough to impair the Stallions' marketing efforts, and attendance for the team's semi-final against Winnipeg (played {{two days before the}} Browns' announcement) was a franchise low of 21,040. Once the Browns' move became official, what remained of local support for the Stallions dried up almost overnight. The team responded with desperate measures, essentially giving away thousands of tickets for what would become the final CFL game played in the United States, and announced a respectable attendance of 30,217 for their victory over San Antonio. Nevertheless, Speros quickly realized that as successful as the Stallions had been, they could not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> to compete with an NFL team; years later, he said that the Stallions would have effectively been [...] "minor league" [...] and faced great logistical problems with Memorial Stadium had they stayed in Baltimore.|$|E
