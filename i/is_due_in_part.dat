5|$|In March 2012, 70% {{of ground}} beef in the U.S. {{contained}} lean finely textured beef, {{and a year}} later in March 2013 the amount was estimated by meat industry officials to be at approximately 5%. This significant reduction <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the extensive media coverage that began in March 2012 about the additive. Kroger Co. and Supervalu Inc. have stopped using the additive.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a strong}} {{contingency}} of Marriott School alumni who pursue a career in academia, with BYU being ranked #8 nationally {{for the number of}} students who go on to earn PhDs. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the MAcc PhD Prep Track and the BYU Honors Program.|$|E

5|$|Since 2010, {{ridership}} on the G {{has risen}} 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. It is the route with {{the fastest growing}} ridership base in the entire system. These improvements will also have the side benefit {{of being able to}} accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the G, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because the G weekday frequencies have become more dependable {{as a result of its}} 2013 review. However, weekend service was still lacking, according to some riders.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2â€“5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the late}} 2000s, The Washington Post wrote that the museum {{struggled}} with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, the museum {{remains one of the}} smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and {{less than one percent of}} the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This <b>is</b> <b>due,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, the museum had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought private funding and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which the museum was expected to pay about $2.1 million. In late 2016, the museum held its first annual African Arts Awards Dinner for over 500 guests.|$|E

25|$|Type I IFNs {{can have}} {{detrimental}} effects during viral and non-viral infections (bacterial, parasitic, fungal). This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by {{the ability of}} type I IFNs to polarize the immune system towards {{a specific type of}} response in order to interfere with virus infections.|$|E
25|$|College and {{university}} programs are very limited. This <b>is</b> <b>due,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> {{to the relatively}} limited demand for forensic document examiners. It also relates {{to the need for}} extensive practical experience, particularly with respect to handwriting examination. It is difficult to include this degree of practical experience in a normal academic program.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2014, {{there were}} 30,000 {{students}} enrolled {{for the first}} time. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by {{the high number of}} out-of-state students. The percentage mix of students at this time were 62% in state and 38% out-of-state. During this time, the freshman class was recorded at 5,000 students.|$|E

25|$|Very few {{complete}} thelodont specimens are known; fewer {{still are}} preserved in three dimensions. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> {{to the lack}} of an internal ossified (i.e. bony) skeleton; it does not help that the scales are poorly, if at all, attached to one another, and that they readily detach from their owners upon death.|$|E
25|$|The long {{border between}} Afghanistan and West Pakistan was uneasy. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the {{independent}} Pashtun tribes that inhabit the area. In addition, the physical boundary is uncertain: the 1893 Durand Line was used by West Pakistan to mark {{the border between the}} two countries, but Afghanistan has never recognised that frontier.|$|E
25|$|Below are the {{passenger}} usage statistics from years starting April 2002 to April 2012. Comparing 2002 with later years {{has shown a}} general increase {{on the line in}} usage. The most recent figures have been attributed to an improved service. The high usage at Clifton Down <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to its proximity to Bristol Zoo and a major shopping area.|$|E
50|$|On March 4, 2003, a {{study was}} {{published}} stating Portland had more wireless hotspots {{per capita than}} any other U.S. city. This <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to PTP's advocacy.|$|R

25|$|The {{climate of}} North Carolina is mild and equable. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to its {{geographical}} position; midway in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the high Appalachian chain offers, to some extent, a shield from cold winter winds of the northwest. On the ocean side, in winter, is the moderating {{influence of the}} warm Gulf Stream, the current of which sweeps along near its shores.|$|E
25|$|Partick {{subway station}} {{is one of}} the largest {{stations}} on the Glasgow Subway network, and has around 1.01 million boardings per year. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to its situation within the city and also the National Rail network. Partick is a relatively large population centre of Glasgow housing around 100,000 people, a significant number of whom use the subway to commute to the city centre.|$|E
25|$|It {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, stemming from the more common activity of caving. Its origins in the United States are more closely associated to scuba diving. Compared to caving and scuba diving, there are relatively few practitioners of cave diving. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the specialized equipment and skill sets required, {{and in part because}} of the high potential risks due to the specific environment.|$|E
25|$|In August {{that same}} year, only 220,000 of the 1million promised laptops had been delivered. Further {{setbacks}} <b>were</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> {{because of the}} government's focus on the A$43billion National Broadband Network.|$|R
2500|$|The {{growth of}} {{maternal}} feminism {{at the expense}} of the new woman in Britain and her colonies may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the rapid expansion of the British empire after 1870.|$|R
5000|$|So far, {{no clear}} {{example of a}} Bahcall-Wolf cusp {{has been found in}} any galaxy or star cluster. [...] This may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the {{difficulty}} of resolving such a feature.|$|R
25|$|The {{publicity}} {{from the}} anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, {{and it never}} fully recovered. Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the Democratic convention of 1996, which nominated Bill Clinton for a second term). Many believe that this <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to the violence and chaos of the 1968 convention.|$|E
25|$|Margie Lussman: A spoiled, stuck-up, brat {{of a girl}} who's in Molly and Tyler's homeroom. Margie's {{favorite}} pastime, by far, is teasing Molly {{about her}} being Tyler's friend and not his girlfriend (this <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to Margie's huge crush on Tyler). She's become even more unpleasant since Zoey came to school and succeeded in scaring her. Margie may never turn from her behavior but she still adds much humor to the series.|$|E
25|$|Some animals develop {{only one}} set of teeth (monophyodont) while others develop many sets (polyphyodont). Sharks, for example, grow {{a new set of}} teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth. Rodent incisors grow and wear away {{continually}} through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length. The industry of the beaver <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> to this qualification. Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as leporidae like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors.|$|E
