50|$|It is {{sometimes}} called Beale's <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle,</b> though {{that is not an}} ideal common name due to the possibility of confusion with the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> proper (Sacalia quadriocellata).|$|E

50|$|<b>Four-eyed</b> <b>turtles</b> {{occur in}} {{freshwater}} streams, brooks, and ponds in woodland, often mountainous habitats. As {{a result of}} their rugged surroundings, they have adapted to become adept climbers.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{quantities}} of turtle shell {{are used as}} an ingredient in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). For instance, Taiwan confirmed that 940 tons of hard shelled turtle bone and 200 tons of soft shell turtle bones were imported between 1992 and 1998. The plastron - the belly shell - is used in TCM prescriptions. Some TCM scientists {{argue that there is}} no difference between plastron and carapace (back shell) bone. So, if both plastron and carapace bone are utilized, the demand of TCM for freshwater <b>turtles,</b> including <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtles,</b> could decrease by 50%. [...] Current TCM research also suggests that there is no pharmaceutical difference in the effects of bone from animals produced on farms and animals captured in nature. As a result, farm production of turtle bone for TCM is likely to increase. In addition, TCM research could help find alternatives to turtle bone such as herbs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In 1998, a {{study on}} forty-five <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtles</b> (Sacalia quadriocellata) was {{initiated}} to gather preliminary biological data of this species and to investigate the feasibility of its captive reproduction. In the following six years, no courtship behavior was found occurring in males and no oviposition in females. From 2004 to 2007, two successful techniques were applied to initiate reproductive behavior: 1) injecting exogenous reproductive hormones; and 2) redu-cing the stress of living in captivity. As {{a result of the}} hormone treatments, courtship behavior and copulation were ob-served during September and October, 2005. However, no courtship displays were seen from the CK males, which were not treated with hormones. Ovulation occurred between December and March, and the correlation was not significant between behavior of ovulation and food intake. Females laid only one clutch of eggs each year, with 2. 47 eggs (n= 34, range= 1 – 4) at average, and 84 eggs were totally obtained, of which 13 were damaged, 52 were infertile and 19 fertile. Of the fertile eggs, nine were hatched with mean incubation period of 105. 9 days (n= 9, range= 89 – 122 days) at tem-perature ranging from 24 to 27 °C...|$|R
50|$|The <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> (Sacalia quadriocellata) is a reptile of {{the order}} Testudines. Its name refers to two bright yellow or green spots that occur {{on the back of}} its head that can look like another pair of eyes.|$|E
50|$|A main {{factor in}} {{the decline of the}} <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> is trade and demand for their shells. Therefore, species {{recovery}} programs are needed to ensure the future of the species. There is currently an extensive communication between zoo and conservation personnel in Vietnam whose goal is to coordinate recovery programs. The recovery programs will include legal protection for the turtles which will affect turtle trading.|$|E
50|$|The <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> {{can grow}} to a {{carapace}} length of 15 cm. Its carapace typically ranges in color from a yellowish-tan {{to a deep}} chocolate-brown, and all turtles have a distinct pattern of lines. The turtle's head is often colorful with yellow or green eyes, yellow stripes, and a pink or red throat. Two (sometimes four) eye-like ocelli occur {{on the back of}} the head, hence the turtle's name.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} notorious {{for its ability}} to produce hybrids with other Geoemydidae, even species that are only distantly related. The {{supposed}} new species [...] "Mauremys" [...] pritchardi was based on a hybrid of unknown origin between a male of this species and a female yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica). Furthermore, it has hybridized with the Chinese stripe-necked turtle (Ocadia sinensis), female Malayan box turtles (Cuora amboinensis), a male <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> (Sacalia quadriocellata), and the Japanese pond turtle (Mauremys japonica) in captivity.|$|E

40|$|Background {{matching}} is {{an important}} way to camouflage and is widespread among animals. In the field, however, few studies have addressed background matching, {{and there has been}} no reported camouflage efficiency in freshwater turtles. Background matching and camouflage efficiency of the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle,</b> Sacalia quadriocellata, among three microhabitat sections of Hezonggou stream were investigated by measuring carapace components of CIE L*a*b* (International Commission on Illumination; lightness, red/green and yellow/blue) color space, and scoring camouflage efficiency through the use of humans as predators. The results showed that the color difference (Delta E), lightness difference (Delta L*), and chroma difference (Delta a*b*) between carapace and the substrate background in midstream were significantly lower than that upstream and downstream, indicating that the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> carapace color most closely matched the substrate of midstream. In line with these findings, the camouflage efficiency was the best for the turtles that inhabit midstream. These results suggest that the four-eyed turtles may enhance camouflage efficiency by selecting microhabitat that best match their carapace color. This finding may explain the high population density of the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>turtle</b> in the midstream section of Hezonggou stream. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to quantify camouflage of freshwater turtles in the wild, laying the groundwork to further study the function and mechanisms of turtle camouflage.

40|$|Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) {{is known}} to {{influence}} sexual behavior in many vertebrate taxa, {{but there have been}} no systematic studies on the role of LHRH in sexual behavior of turtles. We tested the hypotheses that exogenous LHRH analogues would induce sexual behavior of male <b>Four-eyed</b> <b>turtle,</b> Sacalia quadriocellata. We examined this by challenging males with intramuscular injections of mammalian luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRH-A), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), or a combination of the two, and subsequently exposing them to sexually receptive females for behavioral observation. Our data show that the injection of only HCG could not, while that of only LHRH-A could, facilitate sexual behavior along with testicular recrudescence and spermatogenesis in S. quadriocellata. The injection of both LHRH-A and HCG would induce more drastic sexual behavior of the animals than that of LHRH-A alone, indicating HCG enhances the effects of LHRH-A induced sexual behavior. However, different pharmacological dosages of LHRH-A (0. 5 mu g, 1 mu g, 2 mg per 100 g bodyweight) did not correspond to different activity levels. Though the mechanism of LHRH effect was not determined, this study may support that the sexual behavior of S. quadriocellata which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} injection despite regression of the gonads. This is the first report on the exogenous LHRH-A induced sexual behavior for this species. </table...|$|E
