This corresponds to an average current flowing within the channel {{of the order of}} J = Q/τ = 10 kA. Maximum spectral energy is generated near frequencies of f = 1/τ = 10 kHz, or at wavelengths of λ = c/f = 30 km (c is the speed of light).

The corresponding values for average electric current, frequency and wavelength are J = 400 A, f = 40 kHz, and λ = 7.5 km. The energy of K strokes is in general two orders of magnitude weaker than the energy of R strokes.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} decade of the 20 th century, the {{emerging}} ultrawide-band (UWB) impulse technology has found numerous applications in the commercial as well as the military sectors. The rapid technological advances have made it possible to implement (cost-effective, short-range) impulse radar and impulse-radio communication and localization systems. Array beamforming and space–time processing techniques promise further advancement in the operational capabilities of impulse radar and impulse-radio communications to achieve long-range coverage, high capacity, and interference-free quality of reception. In this paper, we introduce a realistic signal model for UWB <b>impulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> and develop the principles of space–time array processing based on the signal model. A space–time resolution function (STRF), a space-frequency distribution function (SFDF), and a monopulse-tracking signal are derived for <b>impulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> received by a self-steering array beamforming system. The directivity peak-power pattern and energy pattern of the beamformer are also derived. Computer plots of the STRF, SFDF, and the beam patterns are obtained too. The directivity beam patterns of <b>impulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> are sidelobe-free and, therefore, there is no need for sidelobe suppression via amplitude weighting of the array elements. Also, the resolution angle for the beam patterns is derived as a decreasing function of array size and frequency bandwidth. Electronic beamsteering based on slope processing of monopulse waveforms is described too.
