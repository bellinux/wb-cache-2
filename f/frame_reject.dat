We analyze responses to surveys of three large demonstrations in Copenhagen, Brussels, and London, organized in connection with the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference (COP- 15) to determine who demonstrated, and how and why the collective action frames employed by demonstrators varied. The demonstrations were products of the mobilization of broad coalitions of groups, and we and significant variation in demonstrators' prognostic framings-the ways in which they formulated solutions to climate problems. Most notably, there was a tension between system-critical framings and those oriented around individual action.

Two pro-GM newspapers and two anti-GM newspapers were selected for analysis, and all articles mentioning GM during the period in question were stored in a machine readable database. This was then analyzed using corpus linguistic and discourse analytic techniques to reveal recurrent wording, themes and content. This text analysis was complemented by 12 interviews with experts involved in the communication of GM issues, and 12 focus-group sessions in which members of the public reacted to selected newspaper texts and other GM material. Both in the press and in public reaction, the issue of GM was found to be intimately associated with other political events of the time, notably the invasion of Iraq. Except among experts, there was little awareness of the official national debate and issues were approached in more general terms. Pro-GM characterization of the issues as primarily scientific, both by newspapers and experts, was rejected by the anti-GM press and campaigners, and by the focus-group participants.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} thought {{to be one of the}} most {{pressing}} environmental problems facing humanity. However, due in part to failures in political communication and how the issue has been historically defined in American politics, discussions of climate change remain gridlocked and polarized. In this dissertation, I explore how climate change has been historically constructed as a political issue, how conflicts between climate advocates and skeptics have been communicated, and what effects polarization has had on political communication, particularly on the communication of climate change to skeptical audiences. I use a variety of methodological tools to consider these questions, including evolutionary frame analysis, which uses textual data to show how issues are framed and constructed over time; Kullback-Leibler divergence content analysis, which allows for comparison of advocate and skeptical framing over time; and experimental framing methods to test how audiences react to and process different presentations of climate change. I identify six major portrayals of climate change from 1988 to 2012, but find that no single construction of the issue has dominated the public discourse defining the problem. In addition, the construction of climate change may be associated with changes in public political sentiment, such as greater pessimism about climate action when the electorate becomes more conservative. As the issue of climate change has become more polarized in American politics, one proposed causal pathway for the observed polarization is that advocate and skeptic framing of climate change focuses on different facets of the issue and ignores rival arguments, a practice known as “talking past. ” However, I find no evidence of increased talking past in 25 years of popular newsmedia reporting on the issue, suggesting both that talking past has not driven public polarization or that polarization is occurring in venues outside of the mainstream public discourse, such as blogs. To examine how polarization affects political communication on climate change, I test the cognitive processing of a variety of messages and sources that promote action against climate change among Republican individuals. Rather than identifying frames that are powerful enough to overcome polarization, I find that Republicans exhibit telltale signs of motivated skepticism on the issue, that is, they <b>reject</b> <b>framing</b> that runs counter to their party line and political identity. This result suggests that polarization constrains political communication on polarized issues, overshadowing traditional message and source effects of framing and increasing the difficulty communicators experience in reaching skeptical audiences.

They address the topic of {{religion}} and politics in Australia in different ways. As such they are further contributions to a growing field, dominated so far by Marion Maddox, God Under Howard: The Rise of the Religious Right in Australian Politics (2005). Frank Brennan will shortly be publishing Acting on Conscience: When Personal Beliefs and Public Life Collide. We have gone from a famine to a feast {{in just a couple}} of years. Amanda Lohrey and Tom Frame have each written short, readable books for a general audience, though at times Frame is heavier going and unduly immersed in academic arguments. Each is stimulated by current developments, particularly by what is often described as the evangelical revival or the rise of the religious right. Lohrey explicitly chooses two moments in 2004 as illustrations: the address by federal Treasurer Peter Costello to Sydney’s Hillsong Church and the success of the new Family First Party in electing a senator in the federal election. Frame is less explicit, but he is clearly concerned by these developments and addresses those Christians who are attracted by them. He writes that “some denominations and individuals are in real danger of fusing religion and politics, and of failing to maintain the necessary distance between church and state that is needed for their healthy interaction”. He is critical of both the Christian Democratic Party and the Family First Party. He is more favorably inclined towards evangelical Christian pressure group activities, such as those of the Australian Christian Lobby, though he still expresses some concerns. Frame, Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force, is an insider, both as a Christian clergyman rather than a non-believer and as member of one of the older established churches rather than one of the newer evangelical churches. In a passage likely to unsettle many of the new religious warriors he writes: From my observations as an “insider”, I would say that many within the church do not understand the questions, appreciate the character of the debate, grasp the attendant theological complexities, acknowledge the lessons of church history, display sufficient humility about the church’s shortcomings, concede a lack of consensus among Christians, understand the nature of political discourse or value the integrity of the state in this country. Sadly, the loss of spiritual authority has created a desire for political influence that has warped religious life in this country. Lohrey, a political observer and well-published novelist, is a sceptical outsider to activist Christianity: “It troubles me when I hear the bishops and Christian politicians pontificate. ” She would rather listen to young Christians. She is sympathetic to liberal humanist values and in a previous Quarterly Essay, Groundswell: The Rise of the Greens, showed considerable sympathy for Green values and political influence. Her final words, after her discussions with some young Christians, reveal her as a not unsympathetic outsider to their values and aspirations: I look at these young adults and they truly are wonderfully made, and I wish we could agree on more; could meet up on some other wordless, plane, free of dogma, free of all this stuff. But unhappily, for me at least, we are here, now, across the divide of the literal Word. Still, the Word notwithstanding, I am left with the impression that some commonality remains. If in their mature years they are still “children of the Reformation” then we will continue to share a commitment to that great humanist project, a secular liberal democracy in which freedom of conscience is paramount; in which the mysterious unknowability of someone else’s faith is respected and protected, but not at the expense of those for whom that mystery is of an altogether different order. It may be that I would choose to emphasise the “secular” in that formulation rather more than these young people, but for now the system embraces us in a broadly consensual understanding of civic virtue. I hope that consensus holds. The two authors disagree about the nature of the Australian state. For Lohrey there is no doubting the “secular state”. She argues that “the poisonous sectarian disputes of the nineteenth century were uppermost in the minds of the framers of the constitution when they formulated section 116 in the hope that this would guarantee the new commonwealth a secular state. ” She emphasises the separation of church and state, with reference to the work of Helen Irving, and concludes that: “This makes Australia the most secular liberal democracy in the world. ” She is at odds with Frame, who concludes that section section 116 was just “a minimalist stab at setting some parameters for the interaction that would inevitably occur” between religion and politics. In fact Frame takes issue most strongly with Irving for claiming that “Australia has a secular heritage” which was “reflected nationally in the Commonwealth Constitution”. But Frame and Lohrey are more inclined to agree that claims about the power of the churches in contemporary Australian politics are overblown. According to Lohrey, “Arguably the most distinctive feature of the Christian Right in Australia is not its actual numbers but its proselytising zeal” which “begins to look like a strategy to manufacture the appearance of a Christian ‘groundswell’. ” Here <b>Frame</b> <b>rejects</b> the claims of Max Wallace and the general tenor of Maddox’s arguments. He believes that “A scent of Christianity continues to pervade the public square but it is fading fast”. The styles of the two books differ. Much of Frame’s is a general introduction to the question of church and state without particular reference to Australia. It draws on political philosophy and history to sketch the evolution of the interrelationship. Only later does it become more oriented to personal observations about Australian developments. Lohrey’s style is of informed and critical journalism. Most of her sources are recent Australian media reports. She chooses “a somewhat unorthodox form for this essay” by opening and closing with “the voices of ordinary believers” - reports of discussions with sixteen year olds and with university students. They make up a considerable part of the book: sixteen of the 75 pages. She too is sometimes passionate, but this time the targets are some church leaders. What really interests Lohrey is the new political right. After an introductory discussion of “The Cool Girls”, a lengthy section on “Selling the Sacred”, containing a most informative analysis of the modern marketing of religion, is devoted to Pastor Brian Houston, Hillsong and the other mega-churches. “Voting for Jesus” includes a substantial discussion of Family First. Later, in “Managing the Culture Wars”, she turns to two examples of the extremist face of the religious right: the Exclusive Brethren and Opus Dei. Lohrey’s chapter “Still the Main Game” recognises the pre-eminent place of the established churches. “Despite all the colour and movement of the Pentecostals, all the clapping and swaying and the number of CDs to hit the charts,” she writes, “the traditional churches are still the main religious game in town. ” She points briefly to their self-interested lobbying successes for the churches’ own infrastructure and efforts in education and welfare. And she recognises their social justice lobbying, which has met “with a singular lack of success” because they have been brushed off by the Howard government when they have protested against government policies on refugees, war and industrial relations. She also examines the attempt by Kevin Rudd and other Labor MPs to articulate Christian Labor values. What really interests Frame is the separation or non-separation of church and state. The first two chapters (almost half of this 95 page book) are devoted to successfully putting church-state discussion in historical and international context. The third chapter, “Whose wall?”, turns to Australia less successfully. His history is too fragmentary to convey fully the lively politics of sectarianism and section 116. The fourth chapter, “No wall, two people?”, contains personal reflections on religion and politics from the late 1960 s, when “the Australian churches were politically influential and active”, to the present day. He is uncomfortable with the new Christian parties and lobbies but also critical of what he sees as militant secularists like the Humanist Society of New South Wales. He takes issue with Maddox, and rightly argues that the evidence that the religious right is ascendant is still thin. But he wrongly suggests that Maddox wants to eliminate religious ideals from the public square; rather her main concern is that the religious right has taken over the expression of religion in public debate from the Christian left, to the disadvantage of Labor and to the advantage of the Howard government. The reality of extensive church-state relations in Australia is largely neglected in these two books. This can either be church delivery of public services in health, education and welfare, or it can be church lobbying efforts to influence government economic and social policies across the board. Lohrey notes: “At any given time religious lobbies work away to influence governments and this is sometimes perceived as sinister, though arguably it is no less or more so than the efforts of other interest groups seeking to influence public policy. ” This all happens in an environment described by Frame in his final chapter as “A land without walls” between church and state. Yet what is most lacking in these books is adequate description of the thicket of relations between church and state. Most of these still involve the major churches rather than representatives of the religious right. The distraction from the main game that the latter represents permeates these two books to their detriment. Frame and Lohrey, the insider and the outsider, may not be too far apart in the role that they would like to see religion playing in politics. Both may underestimate the actual influence that religion does exert. Frame, for instance, reflects the pessimistic view of many inside the churches: Whereas previously the church’s position meant a great deal in national affairs and Christian thinkers were accorded a prime place in the public square, Christians can no longer presume they will even be heard, let alone heeded, in an increasingly indifferent and hostile society. Christians are one among many “special interest” groups vying for influence and the crowd’s ear. Yet in another way both are optimists, Frame confident and Lohrey more tentative. She sees an emerging consensus in the community about civic virtue. He reckons a new relationship is currently under negotiation: The absence of any wall points to the sophistication of Australia’s public life and the quality of its democracy. It also reflects a commitment to shared values and common aspirations that are just as important to those with religious beliefs as to those with none. Even together these books cannot represent the final word. There is a larger story that two short books cannot hope to tell. What is still needed is a better integrated account of the role of both the old and new politics of religion in Australia. • John Warhurst is professor of political science at the Australian National university.

40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of books available {{on the topic of}} motherhood and mothering; the majority of these books focus on the vulnerability of babies and young children and the motherwork such vulnerability demands. In particular they focus on what it is right to do {{in the interests of the}} child, and particularly his or her growth and development. Such a focus is consistent in Western culture with modern moral frameworks where understandings of goodness have been assimilated to dimensions of human action rather than dimensions of human being, selfhood, or specific forms of life. As Charles Taylor has observed, much modern moral philosophy has focused =on what it is right to do rather than the nature of the good life‘ (1989, 13). The master narratives of motherhood and the prevailing social discourses of intensive 1 and sacrificial 2 mothering exemplify this view as such narratives and discourses depict =what mothers are expected to do [and] how mothers are supposed to be‘ (Nelson 2001, 140). From such infant/child-focused accounts a canonical maternal identity can be discerned; arguably, it is a restricted one. The majority of these books fail to address questions related to what it means be a mother in particular situated, existing, living realities. For instance, ask a mother with young children what being a mother means to her and she may speak of the challenges she faces balancing paid employment and her role as a mother, or the impact of the demands being made on her time and energy. However, ask a mother with young adult-children 3 what being a mother means to her and she may speak in similar tones, but she may also speak in differing tones. For example, a "mature" mother may speak of the "empty nest", the "crowded house" and/or "its revolving front door". She may speak of issues related to the vulnerability of the long term marriage, elder care, or grandparenting, or even disillusionment and disenchantment. The purpose of this research is to explore the identity challenges and prospects of some mothers with young adult-children aged between 18 and 30 years of age in twenty-first century Australia. In interpreting the identity challenges and prospects this particular cohort of mothers encounter in their ordinary, everyday living, a diverse and particular range of maternal experiences. my own included 5. have been traced, along with the social and ethical meanings ascribed in them. With an understanding and appreciation of voice as the medium which connects one's inner and outer worlds, this research illuminates the plurality of voices and the multiple layers of meaning in each of these mother's particular living and existing realities. Specifically, this research addresses the narrowly constructed, canonical maternal identity through a critical exploration and reflection on stories, shared in a research context, of the living realities of a group of self-identified "mature", middle-class, Australian mothers with children aged between 18 and 30 years of age 6. By appraising the broader familial, historical, social, cultural, institutional, and, importantly, moral contexts in which these mothers are situated, 'thick descriptions' (Geertz 1973, 27) 7 of maternal identities, and the challenges and prospects these mothers are negotiating, are provided. In terms of its ethical orientation, the frameworks which support and <b>frame</b> this research <b>reject,</b> repudiate and contest (Nelson 2001) the reduction of ethical concerns to individual or intellectual problems or dilemmas to be solved through the application of a theory derived from reasoned thinking. In dismissing deductive and =theoretical-juridical‘ 8 approaches, the individualistic orientation entrenched in contemporary Western moral thinking, expressed in the notion of '"what ought I to do" when faced with a problem, issue or dilemma of practical urgency' (Isaacs & Massey 1994, 1), is simultaneously rejected, repudiated and contested (Nelson 2001). In countering such understandings, this research reorients us to the illumination and articulation of who it is good to be, for each of these mothers, in allegiance with those goods which guide and inspire her orientations towards living a good life—a life which embraces and enhances the flourishing of herself and her significant others. With an understanding and appreciation that 'mind is never free of precommitment[—t]here is no innocent eye, nor is there one that penetrates aboriginal reality' (Bruner 1987, 32), this thesis is written with the voices of other interlocutors 9. These interlocutors include the voices of my research participants whom I refer to as "research interlocutors", my textual "friends" — those scholars whose work resonates strongly with my orientations—as well as the myriad other voices that speak to mothers, for mothers and about mothers, such as those found in popular and mainstream press and culture. Sometimes these voices resonate; other times dissonance may be heard. In situating this research within these complementary frameworks, this research invites readers to join with me in considering, appreciating and appraising the narrow construction of maternal identity. I seek for this engagement, like the engagements with my research interlocutors, to be 'a meeting of voices, an authentic dialogue that is inclusive of the voices of all concerned participants' (Isaacs 2001, 6). I hope that the voices in this thesis resonate with yours (although, at times, you may feel some dissonance) and that together we can draw closer to the accounting, re-counting and re-stor(y) ing of maternal identities; like concentric circles of witness, the dialogue, [...] . will thus be expanded rippling into corners where one might both imagine, and least expect. Possibilities, then, are vast; the future exciting (Smith 2007, 397). This research is also shaped and guided by maternal scholarship, a relatively new field of inquiry known as 'motherhood studies' (O'Reilly 2011, xvii) which has its origins within the broader terrain of feminist scholarship. As a work of maternal scholarship, this thesis draws upon and continues the tradition of examining motherhood as it is experienced 'in a social context, as embedded in a political institution: in feminist terms' (Rich 1995, ix). It values mothers, their experiences, their stories, their lives. As such, this research is oriented towards 'matricentric feminism', a particular form of feminist inquiry, politics and theory which is consistent with and receptive to feminist frameworks of care and equal rights (O‘Reilly 2011, 25). A number of complementary conceptual frameworks have been engaged in this research with the thesis presented in three parts: the pre-figurative, configurative and re-configurative. As my particular living experiences provided the initial motivation for this research, an account of the challenges I experienced as a mother with young adult-children are outlined as a Prelude to this thesis. Attention then turns to Part One – Pre-figuring Maternal Identities in which the contextual, conceptual and methodological foundations underpinning this research are explored and outlined. In Chapter One, the prevailing cultural narratives and social discourses supporting and shaping the construction of the canonical maternal identity are outlined. Next, in setting the scholarly context, the critiques — arising from feminist and maternal scholarship — of motherhood as a patriarchal institution, mothering as experience, and mothering as work, are explored. As this research engaged with participants who are embedded in particular middle-class, heterosexual, familial and cultural structures, an exploration of family life cycle theory and main stream media accounts are also incorporated. The terrain in which "mature" mothering within an Australian context is experienced is also outlined, including the notions of "empty nests" and "crowded houses", grandparenting, elder care and women's midlife transition. Chapter Two gives an account of the conceptual ontological, ethical, identity and narrative frameworks underpinning this research. In setting the context for rich interpretations, the characteristics of being human 10 are outlined before attention turns to our embodiment and embeddedness in our shared human condition 11. From this point, attention then turns to understanding the moral form of human living 12. In appreciating the vulnerability inherent in our shared human condition, the ways in which we may experience trouble in our lives is noted. The framing of identity constitution 13 as complex, multi-faceted, relationally negotiated and composed is then outlined, followed by an understanding of why narrative is a valuable interpretive tool for interpreting and understanding human experiences. This chapter concludes with an appreciation of the ethical significance of storytelling. The research methodology is then outlined in Chapter Three. The rationale underpinning the adoption of the narrative interviewing technique of in-depth interviewing is explored. In exploring these methodological frameworks, the recruitment and interview processes involved in gathering and interpreting the recorded transcripts of ten Australian mothers with young adult-children are outlined. The method of analysis known as the Listening Guide 14 best complements the multi-layered, pluri-vocal nature of narrative accounting. The final section of Chapter Three outlines The Guide, with one mother's recorded transcript used to illustrate this method's step-by-step process. Having gathered an understanding and appreciation of the pluri-vocal, multi-layered nature of narrative and identity constitution, the tone of this thesis changes in Part Two. Configuring Maternal Identities. This section consists of Chapters Four and Five and seeks to find meaning in, and make sense of, the differences and commonalities across these particular accounts. Chapter Four explores the living realities of four Australian mothers with young adult-children: Poppy, Honey, Lily and Heather. In presenting a thick description of these mothers' situated realities, the frameworks. the familial, social, cultural, historical and institutional backgrounds. which have supported and shaped each mother's experiences are illuminated. Simultaneously revealed through these particular accounts are the plurality of goods focusing and moving each mother to the moral form of life, a life of meaning and purpose. The harms challenging some mothers' moral motivations are also revealed in this chapter. Specifically illustrated in Chapter Four are the unique and qualitative differences of particular maternal identity configurations. Chapter Five reveals the commonalities amongst all of the research interlocutors' accounts. This chapter contests the individualistic orientation of many contemporary accounts of motherhood which are aimed at defining or contesting what a "good" mother ought to do. By turning away from such individualistic orientations, the chapter does not seek to define 'the content of obligation' (Taylor 1989, 3) but rather seeks to illuminate and articulate a richer, deeper understanding and appreciation of maternal be-ing and be-coming - that is, who it is good to be, for each of these mothers - in allegiance with those goods that focus and inspire her moral motivations. Part Three - Re-Configuring Maternal Identities, which is comprised of Chapter Six, draws this thesis to a close. In this final chapter, the preconceptions, conditions and aspirations for this mother-centred account of the living realities of a small, local cohort of mothers are reiterated. The insights gathered from the rich, descriptive accounts are illuminated and articulated, and the chapter closes with some suggestions for future research. In a Postlude, I reflect on how this research has been a transformative learning experience in my own life. an experience in which I have been able to not only deeply understand and appreciate the challenges and disorientation I was experiencing but also to identify and reorient my stance in relation to the good. In a practical sense, by offering thick descriptions of the living realities of this cohort of "mature" mothers, this research challenges the canonical maternal identity and questions its relevance for, and effect on, "mature" mothers' identity constitution. By bringing to light the complex existing realities of these particular mothers, this research critiques the canonical maternal identity by illustrating that each mother's life and her identity constitutions are complex, relationally negotiated and composed and that motherhood is an enduring way of being. Through these illustrations, this research engages with and extends understandings of difference feminism. This research, however, not only rejects, repudiates and contests (Nelson 2001) the narrowly defined canonical maternal identity. By illuminating and articulating the goods which shape and inspire these "mature" mothers' motherwork, this research offers a matricentric account which is consistent with and respectful of the particular, situated realities—the broader familial, social, institutional, but most importantly, moral values and frameworks—in which each mother‘s life is embedded and her motherwork oriented. By understanding and appreciating the complex and multiple webs of relationships in which each mother exists, this matricentric re-stor(y) ing of maternal experiences not only understands and appreciates the unique nature of each mother‘s existing realities, it is oriented to the continuing enhancing of the shared pursuit of the good which underpins particular maternal practices and particular maternal ways of being...|$|R
