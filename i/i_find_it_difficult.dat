500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|People with losses {{or other}} trauma, such as sexual abuse in {{childhood}} and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment and {{tend to agree with}} the following statements: [...] "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others." ...|$|E

2500|$|In response, Segerdal and the Church {{brought an}} {{application}} for a writ of mandamus – essentially a request to overrule the Registrar General – to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in London. The case was heard {{by a panel of}} three judges: Lord Parker, the Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Ashworth and Mr Justice Cantley. In its ruling, issued on 14 November 1969, the court dismissed the application with costs awarded against the plaintiffs. Justice Ashworth commented: [...] "While Scientology may be wholly admirable, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to reach the conclusion that it is a religion." ...|$|E

60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{remember}} them. They fade irrevocably {{out of my}} mind even now while I speak and endeavor to recall them, and recollect myself.

6000|$|I {{had long}} been obsessed {{by the idea that}} having no Latin was a {{disadvantage}} in the world, and Archie Garvell had driven the point of this pretty earnestly home.
