40|$|To {{detect a}} strong {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) response to minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in a 5 -d mixed lymphocyte culture, {{it is necessary}} to use a responder that has been primed in vivo with antigen-bearing cells. It has previously been shown that minor-H- specific CTL can be primed in vivo both directly by foreign spleen cells and by presentation of <b>foreign</b> <b>minor</b> H antigens on host antigen- presenting cells. This latter route is evident in the phenomenon of cross-priming, in which H- 2 heterozygous (A x B) F 1 mice injected 2 wk previously with minor H-different H- 2 A (A') spleen cells generate both H- 2 A- and H- 2 B-restricted minor-H-specific CTL. In a study of the kinetics of direct- vs. cross-priming to minors in F 1 mice, we have found that minor H-different T cells actually suppress the induction of virgin CTL capable of recognizing them. CTL activity measured from F 1 mice 3 - 6 d after injection with viable A' spleen cells is largely H- 2 B restricted. The H- 2 A-restricted response recovers such that roughly equal A- and B-restricted activity is detected in mice as early as 8 - 10 d postinjection. This temporary hyporeactivity does not result from generalized immunosuppression [...] it is specific for those CTL that recognize the <b>foreign</b> <b>minor</b> H antigen {{in the context of the}} H- 2 antigens on the injected spleen cells. The injected spleen cells that mediate this suppression are radiosensitive T cells; Lyt- 2 + T cells are highly efficient at suppressing the induction of CTL in vivo. No graft vs. host reaction by the injected T cells appears to be required, as suppression of direct primed CTL can be mediated by spleen cells that are wholly tolerant of both host H- 2 and minor H antigens. Suppression cannot be demonstrated by in vitro mixing experiments. Several possible mechanisms for haplotype-specific suppression are discussed, including inactivation of responding CTL by veto cells and in vivo sequestration of responding CTL by the injected spleen cells...|$|E

These effector cells killed the immunizing altered-self target very well and showed about 1 % cross-reactive lysis of an allogeneic target differing from themselves only at H- 2. These cross-reactive clones were then selected for by repeated in vitro stimulation with the cells bearing foreign H- 2 such that an effector population was obtained which lysed both the altered-self and the alloreactive target with the same efficiency. Cold target competition experiments established that the same killer cell could lyse either target; however, it was not determined if a killer cell uses the same receptor to respond to altered-self antigens as it does respond to foreign H- 2 antigens...|$|E
40|$|The thymus {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a primary site for T cell differentiation since the mid- 1960 s (1, 2). Despite many elegant experiments, attempts to define the relationship between organ morphology, cell kinetics, and cell function have been hindered by the complexity of thymic architecture and the dynamics of cell traffic within this organ, {{as well as the}} absence of well-defined stages in the pathway of T cell differentiation. For example, even the classical division of thymocytes into cortical and medullary cells is a controversial issue. Which compartments immunocompetent thymocytes reside in, whether a precursorproduct relationship exists between cortical and medullary thymocytes, and in what way these populations contribute to the peripheral pool of functionally mature, recent thymic migrants are subjects of intense debate (reviewed in 3). In this paper, we offer evidence that questions two long-standing tenets of thymic physiology, that thymocytes are shielded from extrinsic antigen (4) and that the cell traffic within the thymus is unidirectional, moving from intrinsic stem cells or from bone marrow-derived stem cells to the thymus and to the periphery, never the reverse (5).

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{accepted}} that both class I and class II MHC-restricted T cells recognize denatured or fragmented forms of protein antigens derived {{as a consequence}} of intracellular processing events (1 - 3). While there exists some evidence to suggest that class I and class II presentation rely on distinct processing mechanisms (2, 4, 5), the extent that this difference limits the accessibility of certain types of antigens to one or another presentation pathway remains unclear. In the case of class I presentation {{it has been shown that}}, at least in vitro, exogenous nonreplicating antigens fail to sensitize targets for CTL recognition (6). In contrast, direct introduction of the same proteins into the cell cytoplasm results in effectiveCTL lysis (7, 8). Despite these in vitro studies, there is some evidence to suggest that in vivo, exogenous antigens may be processed for class I-restricted T lymphocyte recognition. For example, it has been shown that in MHC heterozygous Fl mice, CTL restricted to one parental MHC-encoded product can be primed against <b>foreign</b> <b>minor</b> histocompatibility antigens or viral antigens by introducing the antigens on cells expressing the MHC ofthe other parent (9, 10). Consequently, these cell-associated antigens must be taken up, processed, and then presented to CTL precursors by host cells. In this article we address whether this observation can be extended to include soluble proteins. We found that exogenous protein antigens can be processed in vivo for presentation to class I-restricted T cells provided that the antigen is introduced in a cell-associated form...|$|E

BR spleen cells {{led to a}} sequence of negative and positive selection of the host T-cell response against the multiple <b>foreign</b> <b>minor</b> histocompatibility antigens (HA) on the injected cells. By 1 d posttransfer, thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) of the host had lost the capacity to differentiate in vitro into cytotoxic cells specific for the injected minor HA; spleen and lymph node cells, by contrast, gave normal or enriched responses at this time. By 5 d posttransfer, TDL were hyperresponsive to the injected antigens. Selection with disrupted (sonicated) cells gave similar findings. With {{injection of}} either irradiated of disrupted spleen cells, the H- 2 haplotype of the minor HA- bearing cells had no apparent effect on the magnitude of selection. By contrast, treatment of spleen cells with glutaraldehyde before injection led to H- 2 restriction of selection, i. e., negative selection of the CBA response to B 10. BR was marked with injection of glutaraldehyde-treated H- 2 -compatible B 10. BR cells but was minimal with H- 2 -different B 10 or B 10. D 2 cells. These data are taken to imply that, at least in H- 2 -incompatible situations, the minor HA-bearing cells must be processed by host cells, i. e., to allow the antigens to become associated with self H- 2 determinants. Circumstantial evidence from studies on the specificity of selection induced with glutaraldehyde- treated cells from mice of the B 10 recombinant strains suggested that I region-restricted T cells may control the induction of H 2 K, D- restricted cytotoxic precursor cells...|$|E
40|$|Two {{magnetic}} transitions {{are observed}} in the magneto-superconducting RuEu 2 -xCexSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (Ru- 1222), at TM 160 K and TM 2 ~ 80 K. Below TM 2 the Ru moments are weak-ferromagnetically ordered and wide ferromagnetic hysteresis loops are observed, they become narrow and disappear at ~ 60 - 70 K. Above TM 2, (i) small antiferromagnetic-like hysteresis loops reappear with a peak in the coercive fields around 120 K. (ii) A small peak at ~ 120 K is also {{observed in the}} dc and ac susceptibility curves. The two phenomena are absent in the non-SC x= 1 samples. For x< 1, the decrease of the Ce 4 + content, is compensated by non-homogeneous oxygen depletion, which may induce a reduction of Ru 5 + ions to Ru 4 +. The higher ordering temperature, TM, which does not change with x, may result from Ru 4 + rich clusters, in which the Ru 4 +-Ru 4 + exchange interactions are stronger than the Ru 5 +-Ru 5 + interactions. In the superconducting Ru 1 -xMoxSr 2 Eu 1. 5 Ce 0. 5 Cu 2 O 10 (x= 0 - 0. 4) system, TM 2 shifts to low temperature with x (14 K for x= 0. 4), whereas TM is not affected by the Mo content, indicating again that TM may not correspond to the main phase. Two scenarios are suggested to explain the magnetic phenomena at TM 2 <T< TM.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the antigenic requirements for restimulation of H- 2 - restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro {{to determine whether}} H- 2 I region-restricted helper T cells are required in these responses. In one set of experiments, we studied the in vitro response of (responder x nonresponder) F(1) female T cells to the male antigen H-Y. We chose to examine this response {{because it has been}} suggested that the defect in nonresponder strains is a failure of helper T cells to recognize H-Y in association with nonresponder I region determinants. However, we find that nonresponder male stimulator cells are as effective as F(1) male stimulator cells at inducing H-Y-specific CTL responses. This finding calls into question reports that secondary CTL responses to H-Y are dependent upon the activation of H-Y- specific helper T cells restricted to responder type I region determinants. In a second set of experiments, we examined the requirements for restimulation of H- 2 -restricted T cells specific for minor-histocompatibility antigens from long-term mixed lymphocyte cultures. These cultures were established by repeatedly restimulating cultures of specific T cells with H- 2 -matched stimulator cells expressing <b>foreign</b> <b>minor</b> histocompatibility antigens. We found that H- 2 D-restricted T ceils, including CTL, could be restimulated with cells that were matched with the responding cells at only the D region genes. This response did not appear to result from positive allogeneic effects or from antigen processing and “representation” by responder type APC that might contaminate the cultures. Thus, we find no evidence for a requirement for I region-restricted helper T cells in these CTL responses. However, helper T cells are required because we find that CTL lines derived by limit-dilution cloning from these long-term MLC are absolutely dependent upon exogenous helper factors for growth. The most simple interpretation of these results is that the helper cells are restricted to H- 2 antigens other than I region antigens or to antigens that code outside of the H- 2 complex. Finally, we show that factor-dependent CTL lines must recognize their specific antigen to proliferate, even in the presence of exogenous factors. The requirement of activated CTL for antigen to proliferate provides an explanation for how specific CTL can be selectively enriched in MLC by specific antigen stimulation. Furthermore, it is at variance with reports that memory CTL or activated CTL require only interleukin 2 for restimulation...|$|E

From 2006 to July 2014, a total of 3255 <b>foreign</b> unaccompanied <b>minors</b> were registered in Croatia, of whom about 400 were asylum seekers, mainly citizens of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia. It is obvious that they stay shortly in the institutions entitled for their care and arbitrarily leave them within just a few weeks from the day of arrival. Policies and measures aimed at the welfare and protection of <b>foreign</b> unaccompanied <b>minors</b> include state mechanisms in the domains of establishing the identity and age of a minor, appointment of a guardian, ensuring accommodation and freedom of movement, legal and financial support, health and social care, language learning, education and ensuring their reunification with family.

These obligations cannot be arbitrarily curtailed by excluding specific groups of children. Therefore, the enjoyment of rights stipulated in the Convention is not limited to children who are citizens of a State party and must therefore, if not explicitly stated otherwise in the Convention, also be available to all children – including asylum-seeking, migrant and refugee children – irrespective of their nationality, immigration status or statelessness 1.

40|$|Immigration to Germany, Italy and Finland {{represent}} {{different stages}} of the ‘new migration’ to Europe. The scale and types of immigration also differ between the three. Though each country is experiencing {{different stages of}} immigration, they all recognize the necessity to better integrate <b>foreign</b> <b>minors.</b> The three countries seem to have only recently started to regard themselves as countries of immigration. As a result, their policies towards <b>foreign</b> <b>minors</b> seem {{to be based on}} tolerating, not integrating them. The presence of <b>foreign</b> <b>minors</b> in the juvenile justice system is a reflection on their approaches and attitudes towards immigrants. Therefore, we set out on an 18 -month project funded by the European Commission to study how being ‘foreign’ affects the treatment of minors in the penal systems in Italy, Germany and Finland. The project is called “INTO: Inside the Outsiders: Deviant Immigrant Minors and Integration Strategies in European Justice Systems. ” In this paper, we will present the difficulties encountered when creating comparable data in terms of contrasting labels for and definitions of the target group and data collection as well as the solutions created for addressing these difficulties. At the outset of the project, {{it became clear that the}} terms used to define the target group had different meanings for each of the partners and one term was not deemed sufficient for use in all three contexts, both due to the immigration history in each country and due to the counting methods used by the data collection institutions in each country (National Censuses, Justice Systems, etc.). In the project proposal, we defined ‘immigrant minors’ as including two categories of children: 1) those born in the host country and are either naturalised citizens, hold dual citizenship or are permanent residents 2) children who immigrated to the host country with their family or by themselves. Yet statistical data in each country uses multiple and diverse terms to describe our target group – <b>foreign</b> <b>minors,</b> migrants, ethnic minorities, foreign citizens, etc. Clearly, this made the collection and comparison of three different sets of national statistics quite challenging. The diverse terminology and categorisation of ‘immigrant minors’ in the three countries made it difficult to find directly comparable statistics. The discussion of how to resolve this ‘technical’ difficultly revealed the different conceptions of what it means to be an ‘immigrant’ and a ‘minor’ in each country and within their respective social and judicial systems. This discussion reflected each country’s individual conceptions and laws regarding citizenship as well as their past and present approaches to integration. We argue that despite their different labels, social class and rights, foreigners, ethnic minorities and migrants share similar social conditions. Foreigners, even when they become citizens, still experience social constraints and suffer in the process of cultural integration. Migrants, who must overcome the legal and economic challenges and risks of migrating, have difficulty fully integrating into the host society. The second generation seems to experience greater frustration from their continued exclusion. Ethnic minorities are often identifiable and visibly different from the majority which prevents their full integration despite being long-established in a country. They all remain ‘foreign’ from the perspective of the autochthonous population. And when examining discrimination, we find that these terms often overlap and are used interchangeably. Given this background, it is no wonder that there are difficulties in addressing this ‘new migration’ to Europe. The social conflicts arising from the recent migration, during the last fifty years (at most), cannot be easily understood in terms of class, racial or ethnic conflict. While we might say the subjects of this conflict belong to a socially disadvantaged group or that our societies are quick to discriminate against them, we cannot, since the situation is still not clear. What is clear is that it will continue to be difficult to study these difficult issues in a European setting if we lack of adequate, comparable data collection techniques in Europe. However, refining the techniques will require serious reflection and discussion of the terms currently in use and of the theoretical approaches to immigration in each of the European member states. This is a reflection we intend to begin in this paper. Diversity, Immigrant Minors, Marginalisation, Criminality...|$|R
50|$|Denmark is {{primarily}} a transit and destination country for women and children from Baltic countries, East and Central Europe, Nigeria, Thailand, and South America subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution. There was one report last year of a male teenager from Nigeria rescued from the commercial sex trade in Denmark. The government did not report any cases of forced labor during the reporting period, though the Danish Anti-Trafficking Center highlighted that workers in domestic service, restaurants, hotels, factories, and agriculture, may be vulnerable to forced labor in Denmark. There were unconfirmed reports of foreign children being forced to engage in organized street crime. The government released a report in 2010 about increasing evidence that “au pair” organizations {{could be used as}} front companies for human trafficking. The hundreds of unaccompanied <b>foreign</b> <b>minors</b> who arrive in Denmark every year are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.|$|R
