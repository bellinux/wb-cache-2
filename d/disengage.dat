5|$|At 00:16, Scott {{ordered his}} ships {{to turn to}} a heading of 330° {{in an attempt to}} pursue the fleeing Japanese ships. Scott's ships, however, quickly lost sight of Gotō's ships, and all firing ceased by 00:20. The American {{formation}} was beginning to scatter, so Scott ordered a turn to 205° to <b>disengage.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 August {{the battle}} was {{repeated}} against Bf 109s and Bf 110s over the same area. Dundas shot down another Bf 110. Shaking off a Bf 109, he damaged another but was forced to <b>disengage</b> as more German fighters closed in and fuel and ammunition had run low. His fifth victory now made him a flying ace.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{solutions}} that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear in 1881, and this system {{was still in}} use in the late 20th century.The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear consists of three mechanisms. There are two <b>disengaging</b> hooks, one {{at each end of}} the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two <b>disengaging</b> hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the <b>disengaging</b> release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin connecting wire rope is called the [...] "Fore and After". The <b>disengaging</b> hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each <b>disengaging</b> hook.|$|R

5000|$|The Haldex Electronic Control Unit (ECU) <b>disengages</b> the Haldex {{clutch in}} the centre {{coupling}} {{as soon as}} brakes are applied to allow ABS work properly. When performing tight low-speed turns (e.g. parking) the clutch is <b>disengaged</b> by Electronic Control Unit to avoid [...] "wind-up" [...] in transmission. When Electronic Stability Programs (ESP) are activated the Haldex is <b>disengaged</b> to allow the ESP system to effectively control the vehicle. This applies under acceleration and deceleration conditions.|$|R
5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than <b>disengage</b> from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to <b>disengage</b> and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to <b>disengage</b> and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.|$|E
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to <b>disengage</b> before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|In his {{withdrawal}} {{instructions for}} the 7th Cavalry, Colonel Cecil Nist, the regimental commander, ordered the 2nd Battalion to <b>disengage</b> from the North Koreans to its front and attack to its rear to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment. Efforts to gain possession of Hill 464 by other elements had failed {{in the past several}} days.|$|E

5000|$|For a helicopter, [...] "autorotation" [...] {{refers to}} the {{descending}} maneuver in which the engine is <b>disengaged</b> from the main rotor system and the rotor blades are driven solely by the upward flow of air through the rotor. The freewheeling unit is a special clutch mechanism that <b>disengages</b> any time the engine rotational speed {{is less than the}} rotor rotational speed. If the engine fails, the freewheeling unit automatically <b>disengages</b> the engine from the main rotor allowing the main rotor to rotate freely.|$|R
50|$|The salts are {{concentrated}} in the boiler, as steam is <b>disengaged</b> from liquid water. Given that the concentration of salts increases, the boiling point temperature {{of the mixture of}} salts is affected. In most salts, this will increase the boiling point temperature, and the steam temperature that is <b>disengaged.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to <b>disengage</b> from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to <b>disengage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to <b>disengage,</b> but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} <b>disengage,</b> with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} the Black Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, based primarily at Batumi. She {{took part in the}} bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi on 14–16 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to <b>disengage,</b> both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i Bülend and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to engage and <b>disengage</b> from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and {{was subject to}} adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
30|$|Goldhammer et al. (2016) {{investigated}} {{whether the}} P +> 0 % indicator of <b>disengaged</b> response {{behavior can be}} considered valid, which requires the indicator to identify responses with no chance for success (e.g., due to rapid guessing or because the time spent on the item was below the minimum allowing for success above chance level). Following the procedures described by Lee and Jia (2014), they determined the average proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> response behavior across items (and additionally by item) for each construct, {{as well as the}} correlations between score group and proportion correct for engaged and <b>disengaged</b> response behavior by item. One example of their findings is that the proportion correct for engaged responses in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving were 0.56, 0.63 and 0.43, respectively, in comparison to 0 for <b>disengaged</b> responses by definition according to the P +> 0 % method. Compared to other methods specifying constant thresholds of 5000 or 3000  ms, or item-specific thresholds obtained by inspecting visually the (bimodal) response time distribution, the P +> 0 % method resulted in the greatest difference in proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> responses, suggesting that the method separates <b>disengaged</b> and engaged responses very well. Taken together, these validity checks indicate that the P +> 0 % indicator can validly be interpreted as a measure of test-taking disengagement.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were {{unlikely}} to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to <b>disengage</b> from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{division}} did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor assets {{were used as}} mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar attack. It also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made {{up the majority of}} {{the division}}'s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to <b>disengage</b> when it was attacked.|$|E

On 16 April 1968, Company A 1/9 Marines began a patrol southwest of Hill 689, when it was ambushed by NVA soldiers in bunkers concealed in the thick vegetation. Two more companies from 1/9 Marines were dispatched to save them, but they became ensnarled in this confusing battle and were unable to <b>disengage</b> until the early morning of 17 April. Casualties amounted to 38 Marines and 3 Navy Corpsmen KIA, 3 MIA and 32 wounded. The battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel John Cahill was relieved of duty.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to <b>disengage</b> from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E

The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00.
