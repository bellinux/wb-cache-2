They called Noah [...] "old man," [...] and asked him what the Ark was for. Noah replied that God was bringing a flood upon them. They asked with what God would flood the earth. If God brought a flood of fire, they said, they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> called alitha (that would extinguish fire). If God brought a flood of water up from the earth, they said, they had iron plates with which they could cover the earth (to prevent the water from coming up). If God brought a flood of water from heaven, they said, they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> called akob (or some say akosh) (that could ward it off).

2500|$|Ephron first {{conceived}} {{of this story}} in 1999 as an HBO movie. Ephron focused {{the story on the}} career of New York City tabloid columnist Mike McAlary from his early beginnings to his rise to stardom, when he received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for exposing police brutality against a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima in Brooklyn's 70th precinct, and his death, eight months later, of cancer. Ephron, who had been a New York Post reporter, had previously written about her own career in journalism in the novel I Remember Nothing. She once wrote, [...] "I can’t remember which came first—wanting to be a journalist or wanting to date a journalist"; she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> for journalists like McAlary. Since McAlary lost his battle with cancer, Ephron had spent her six years battling cancer by directing a film and writing two as well as writing two plays; Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune speculates that Ephron chose this subject because she shared a bond with a journalist who [...] "also did some of his best writing while battling cancer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of baseball in Canada during Walker's youth was minuscule {{in contrast to}} the following he would help spawn related to his later success with the Montreal Expos. [...] Previously, Canadian baseball luminaries included Tip O'Neill, the first Canadian to win a Triple Crown back in 1887, and Ferguson Jenkins, Canada's first selectee to the American Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. [...] It was Walker who would help dramatically increase the profile of the sport in a hockey-mad nation. [...] Part of the factor was Canada's short summers, so it is more challenging to play outdoors than in the United States. [...] Recalled Walker later in his major league career, “I’d never seen a forkball, never seen a slider. [...] I didn’t know they existed. [...] I had never really seen a good curveball. [...] In Canada, as a kid, we’d play 10 baseball games a year. [...] Fifteen, tops. [...] Some pitchers <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> they’d call a spinner, but nothing like this. [...] Baseball just wasn’t big. [...] The weather was against it. [...] Nobody ever played baseball thinking about making the major leagues." [...] He was also unaware of many of the rules, attesting to his lack of experience playing when he turned a professional.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Sendra from Allmusic said: [...] "The {{title of}} Carla Bruni's 2008 album, Comme Si de Rien N'Etait (As If Nothing Had Happened), {{is a good}} joke. After all, since her last album Bruni fell into a {{whirlwind}} romance with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and ended up marrying him and becoming the [...] "First Lady" [...] of France. That's a pretty big [...] "something", and indeed it isn't often that the romance of a singer and a president is chronicled on record as it is here—though {{you need to be}} fluent in French to catch the details, since only her cover of '50s pop classic [...] "You Belong to Me" [...] (which is a witty nod to a semi-scandalous trip the couple took to Egypt and other exotic locales before they were wed) is in English. You don't need to know exactly what's going on lyrically, because the intimate-sounding arrangements on the ballads and the light and breezy sound of the more uptempo tunes clue you in that there is romance in the air. Along with the nice arrangements, the best thing about the album is Bruni's intimate and sultry singing. She can purr like a Gainsbourg girl, strut sassily, or croon quite tenderly—sometimes all within the same song. Most of the time she sounds like you always hoped a '60s French bombshell would sound but never quite did (think Bardot or Birkin). Not surprisingly, Bruni appears totally in control throughout the album, which could be down to her having written almost all of the songs herself, or could be down to her new position in the world. Whatever the reason, it makes for quite an improvement over her previous album, No Promises, and fulfills the promise of her charming debut, Quelqu'un M'a Dit. It is probably the best album released by a [...] "First Lady", but beyond that, it's a pleasant, sometimes compelling album by a singer/songwriter with some stories to tell and a lovely way of telling them." [...] BBC said: [...] "Bruni's disc may not win her new fans in the stolidly un-French speaking UK. But removed from the context of her very public private life, this is a charming album." [...] The Telegraph said: [...] "The Premiere Dame may have a colourful past, but her music has always been as classically chic and subtly sexy as her Christian Dior wardrobe." [...] SFGate said: [...] "Even before she married French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Carla Bruni <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> for prominent men such as Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. So even though the lyrics on her third album, [...] "Comme Si de Rien N'Etait" [...] ("As If Nothing Happened"), were written before her latest romantic coup, it's hard to separate content from context, especially when, in the song [...] "Tu Es Ma Came", the singer describes her lover as [...] "more dangerous than Colombian white". But the mild-mannered music hardly matches the exuberance of lines like that. Slathered with strings, horns, and folk and blues guitars, Bruni's new album is not quite as charming as her 2003 premiere, [...] "Quelqu'un M'a Dit". Still, songs such as [...] "L'Amoureuse" [...] and [...] "Déranger Les Pierres" [...] are quite beautiful, and [...] "Salut Marin", a tribute to her late brother, might represent one of Bruni's finest recorded moments yet." ...|$|E

We hadn't <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to eat or drink durin' that whole blow, an' we was pretty ravenous. We found a keg of water which was all right, and a box of biscuit which was what you might call softtack, fur they was soaked through an' through with sea-water. We eat a lot of them so, fur we couldn't wait, an' the rest we spread on the deck to dry, fur the sun was now shinin' hot enough to bake bread. We couldn't go below much, fur there was a pretty good swell on the sea, an' things was floatin' about so's to make it dangerous. But we fished out a piece of canvas, which we rigged up ag'in' the stump of the {{mainmast}} so that we could have somethin' that we could sit down an' grumble under. What struck us all the hardest was that the bark was loaded with a whole cargo of jolly things to eat, which was just as good as ever they was, fur the water couldn't git through the tin cans in which they was all put up, an' here we was with nothin' to live on but them salted biscuit. There wasn't no way of gittin' at any of the ship's stores, or any of the fancy prog, fur everythin' was stowed away tight under six or seven feet of water, an' pretty nigh all the room that was left between decks was filled up with extry spars, lumber, boxes, an' other floatin' stuff. All was shiftin', an' bumpin', an' bangin' every time the vessel rolled.|$|E
60|$|I {{got into}} my place without any examining. Looking back now, I think I can see with {{accuracy}} {{what was then}} the condition of my own mind and intelligence. Of things to be learned by lessons I knew almost less than could be supposed possible after the amount of schooling I had received. I could read neither French, Latin, nor Greek. I could speak no foreign language,--and I may as well say here as elsewhere that I never acquired the power of really talking French. I have been able to order my dinner and take a railway ticket, but never got much beyond that. Of the merest rudiments of the sciences I was completely ignorant. My handwriting was in truth wretched. My spelling was imperfect. There was no subject as to which examination would have been possible on which I could have gone through an examination otherwise than disgracefully. And yet I think I knew more than the average young men of the same rank who began life at nineteen. I could have given a fuller list of the names of the poets of all countries, with their subjects and periods,--and probably of historians,--than many others; and had, perhaps, a more accurate idea of the manner in which my own country was governed. I knew the names of all the Bishops, all the Judges, all the Heads of Colleges, and all the Cabinet Ministers,--not a very useful knowledge indeed, but one that had not been acquired without other matter which was more useful. I had read Shakespeare and Byron and Scott, and could talk about them. The music of the Miltonic line was familiar to me. I had already made up my mind that Pride and Prejudice was the best novel in the English language,--a palm which I only partially withdrew after a second reading of Ivanhoe, and did not completely bestow elsewhere till Esmond was written. And though I would occasionally break down in my spelling, I could write a letter. If I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to say, I could so say it in written words that the readers should know what I meant,--a power which is by no means at the command of all those who come out from these competitive examinations with triumph. Early in life, at the age of fifteen, I had commenced the dangerous habit of keeping a journal, and this I maintained for ten years. The volumes remained in my possession unregarded--never looked at--till 1870, when I examined them, and, with many blushes, destroyed them. They convicted me of folly, ignorance, indiscretion, idleness, extravagance, and conceit. But they had habituated me to the rapid use of pen and ink, and taught me how to express myself with faculty.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time I was engaged with others in {{establishing}} a periodical Review, in which some of us trusted much, and from which we expected great things. There was, however, in truth so little combination of idea among us, {{that we were not}} justified in our trust or in our expectations. And yet we were honest in our purpose, and have, I think, done some good by our honesty. The matter on which we were all agreed was freedom of speech, combined with personal responsibility. We would be neither conservative nor liberal, neither religious nor free-thinking, neither popular nor exclusive;--but we would let any man who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to say, and knew how to say it, speak freely. But he should always speak with the responsibility of his name attached. In the very beginning I militated against this impossible negation of principles,--and did so most irrationally, seeing that I had agreed to the negation of principles,--by declaring that nothing should appear denying or questioning the divinity of Christ. It was a most preposterous claim to make for such a publication as we proposed, and it at once drove from us one or two who had proposed to join us. But we went on, and our company--limited--was formed. We subscribed, I think, 1250 each. I at least subscribed that amount, and--having agreed to bring out our publication every fortnight, after the manner of the well-known French publication,--we called it The Fortnightly. We secured the services of G. H. Lewes as our editor. We agreed to manage our finances by a Board, which was to meet once a fortnight, and of which I was the Chairman. And we determined that the payments for our literature should be made on a liberal and strictly ready-money system. We carried out our principles till our money was all gone, and then we sold the copyright to Messrs. Chapman & Hall for a trifle. But before we parted with our property we found that a fortnightly issue was not popular with the trade through whose hands the work must reach the public; and, as our periodical had not become sufficiently popular itself to bear down such opposition, we succumbed, and brought it out once a month. Still it was The Fortnightly, and still it is The Fortnightly. Of all the serial publications of the day, it probably is the most serious, the most earnest, the least devoted to amusement, the least flippant, the least jocose,--and yet it has the face to show itself month after month to the world, with so absurd a misnomer! It is, as all who know the laws of modern literature are aware, a very serious thing to change the name of a periodical. By doing so you begin an altogether new enterprise. Therefore should the name be well chosen;--whereas this was very ill chosen, a fault for which I alone was responsible.|$|E
