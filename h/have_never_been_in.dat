25|$|Some {{crystals}} {{have formed}} by magmatic and metamorphic processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline rock. The {{vast majority of}} igneous rocks are formed from molten magma {{and the degree of}} crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as granite, which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of lava were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or glassy matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as marbles, mica-schists and quartzites, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like limestone, shale and sandstone and <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a molten condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of metamorphism have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.|$|E

500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E
500|$|Sousa's {{antipathy}} to recording {{was such}} that he almost never conducted his band when it was being recorded. Nevertheless, Sousa's band made numerous recordings, the earliest being issued on cylinders by several companies, followed by many recordings on discs by the Berliner Gramophone Company and its successor, the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). The Berliner recordings were conducted by Henry Higgins (one of Sousa's cornet soloists) and Arthur Pryor (Sousa's trombone soloist and assistant conductor), with Sousa quoted as saying, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the gramophone company's office in my life." [...] A handful of the Victor recordings were actually conducted by Sousa, but most were conducted by Pryor, Herbert L. Clarke, Edwin H. Clarke, or by four of Victor's most prolific house musicians: Walter B. Rogers (who had also been a cornet soloist with Sousa), Rosario Bourdon, Josef Pasternack, and Nathaniel Shilkret. Details of the Victor recordings {{are available in the}} external link below to the EDVR.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is needed}} to {{determine}} the prevalence of the disorder in those who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> therapy, and the prevalence rates across cultures. These central issues relating to the epidemiology of DID remain largely unaddressed despite several decades of research. [...] The debates over the causes of DID also extend to disagreements over how the disorder is assessed and treated.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue that}} can lead {{researchers}} not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from {{taking part in the}} experiment. [...] It is an ethical principle that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. [...] Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. [...] If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. [...] For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. [...] Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. [...] Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. [...] An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave HIV antibodies in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with an HIV carrier. [...] This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance.|$|E
