40|$|A climatological {{validation}} of the 6 -hourly operational ECMWF troposphere and lower stratosphere temperatures as well as geopotential heights between 1000 and 10 hPa is performed using the 2001 – 2007 (80 months from May 2001 to December 2007) CHAMP radio occultation data. Generally {{there is a good}} agreement between ECMWF and CHAMP temperatures averaged over 300 – 10 hPa for all years/seasons with global annual mean biases (standard deviations) less than 0. 3 (1. 7) K. Regional and temporal discrepancies occur within the polar vortex mainly on the Southern Hemisphere and the tropical tropopause region. Global annual mean biases (standard deviations) of geopotential heights between 300 and 10 hPa are in the range of &minus; 30 up to + 5 (30 – 50) <b>geopotential</b> <b>meter.</b> Larger deviations from the mean values are also observed in the tropics and polar zones. Both, the biases and standard deviations between CHAMP and ECMWF temperatures and geopotential heights differ significantly before and after February and December 2006, i. e. the dates when ECMWF increased the number of model levels from L 60 to L 91 (1 February 2006) and where ECMWF {{became one of the first}} weather centers assimilating radio occultation data (since 12 December 2006), mainly from the COSMIC mission. At ECMWF the CHAMP data were only assimilated until 4 February 2007, e. g. both data sets are mostly independent from each other during the time period considered here...|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} equations for computing density at various height regimes below 86 geometric km (84 852 <b>geopotential</b> <b>meters</b> or 278,385.8 <b>geopotential</b> feet). The first equation is used when the value of standard temperature lapse rate is not equal to zero; the second equation is used when standard temperature lapse rate equals zero.|$|R
40|$|Ethiopia, but a {{decrease}} in precipitation over the south-ern part of the country. Such a dipole pattern is attribut-able to the intensification of the North Atlantic subtropi-cal high (NASH) in a warmer climate, which influences Ethiopian Kiremt-season precipitation mainly by modulat-ing atmospheric vertical motion. Diagnosis of the omega equation demonstrates that an intensified NASH increases (decreases) the advection of warm air and positive vorticity into the central Highlands and northern Great Rift Valley (southern part of the country), enhancing upward motion over the northern Rift Valley but decreasing elsewhere. Under the RCP 4. 5 scenario, the high-resolution models project an intensification of the NASH by 15 (3 × 105 m 2 s− 2) <b>geopotential</b> <b>meters</b> (stream function) at the 850 -hPa level, contributing to the projected precipitation change over Ethiopia. The influence of the NASH on Kiremt-season precipitation becomes more evident in the future due to the offsetting effects of two other major circulation systems: the East African Low-level Jet (EALLJ) and the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ). The high-resolution models project a strengthening of the EALLJ, but a weakening of the TEJ. Future changes in the EALLJ and TEJ will drive this precipitation system in opposite directions, leading to small or no net changes in precipitation in Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{atmospheric circulation}} during polar low events over the Nordic seas (the North Atlantic between Greenland and Novaya Zemlya) is investigated {{on the basis}} of a recently compiled data set that was derived purely from satellite observations. A classification system is applied that divides the polar lows into four types (western polar lows, eastern polar lows, Greenland lee polar lows, and storm track polar lows). Type-specific large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are identified from National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. These are distinct in sea level pressure, upper level geopotential height, and the difference between the skin temperature of the ocean and upper level temperature. Eastern polar lows are found to be associated with a strong blocking situation caused by anomalously high pressure over Iceland and a synoptic-scale low-pressure anomaly over the Barents Sea. A weaker blocking situation with an anomalous ridge over Greenland reaching into the Irminger Sea and a low-pressure anomaly over the Norwegian Sea favors the development of western polar lows. Typical values for polar low genesis are a geopotential height of 5030 <b>geopotential</b> <b>meters</b> at 500 hPa and a difference of 48 K between the skin temperature of the ocean and the temperature at 500 hPa. The locations of upper level low-pressure anomalies relative to the locations of the related anomalies at the sea level show that western and eastern polar lows form, on average, in a much less baroclinic large-scale environment than Greenland lee and storm track polar lows.
