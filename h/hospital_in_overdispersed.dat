50|$|Anderson and Gordon (1982) {{propose that}} the {{distribution}} of macroparasites in a host population is regulated {{by a combination of}} positive and negative density-dependent processes. <b>In</b> <b>overdispersed</b> distributions, a small proportion of hosts harbour most of the parasite population. Positive density-dependent processes contribute to overdispersion of parasite populations, whereas negative density-dependent processes contribute to underdispersion of parasite populations. As mean parasite burden increases, negative density-dependent processes become more prominent and the distribution of the parasite population tends to become less overdispersed.|$|R
