40|$|The diethyl ether-extracted organic {{compounds}} of 155 samples of unifloral grade New Zealand kamahi and honeydew honeys, and New Zealand and Norwegian erica honeys, {{together with a}} series of active and inactive manuka honeys were analysed using combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was found that Kamahi honey is characterized by the presence of 2, 6 -dimethylocta- 3, 7 -diene- 2, 6 -diol, meliracemoic acid, and kamahines A-C and these compounds were typically present at average levels of 31, 14, and 73 mg/kg of honey, respectively. 2, 6 -Dimethylocta- 3, 7 -diene- 2, 6 -diol was isolated and the structure of this compound was defined using one- and two-dimensional NMR analyses. The only recognizably distinct peak present in the honeydew honey profile was indole acetic acid. In this honey, a relatively low to moderate level of indole acetic acid, ranging from 0. 9 to 9. 1 mg/kg honey was detected. In the New Zealand erica honey samples, ericinic acid, isoericinic acid isomers (average levels 363 and 34 mg/kg respectively), trans,cis and trans,trans-abscisic acid isomers (average levels 302 and 224 mg/kg respectively) and benzoic acid (average level 6950 mg/kg) were identified as floral marker compounds. Ericinic acid was isolated and the structure of this acid was defined using one-and two-dimensional NMR analyses. Low levels of ericinic and isoericinic acids (average levels of 1. 1 and 0. 32 mg/kg respectively) were detected in the Norwegian erica-rich honeys. The results presented here indicate that ericinic and isoericinic acids are likely to be universally present in erica honeys at levels which may range from as low as 1 mg/kg or less, as found in some Norwegian samples, to more than 100 mg/kg in some New Zealand samples. Two groups, namely a fingerprint pattern which characterized active manuka honeys, and a fingerprint pattern that characterized inactive manuka honeys were identified. Some substances contributing to the GCMS profile were found as marker compounds for the presence of unidentified substances responsible for the UMF activity. A statistically significant correlation was found between a small set of marker compounds (i. e. phenylacetic acid, 2 -methoxyacetophenone, 2 -methoxybenzoic, phenyllactic, octanedioic, cis-cinnamic, trans-cinnamic, nonanedioic, 4 -methoxyphenyllactic and <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acids</b> and methyl syringate) and UMF activity of manuka honey. The best-fit marker compound regression equation (R = 0. 92) was obtained for a set of pooled 30 moderate to high activity (UMF gt 14. 1) samples. It was shown that the marker compound regression equation is capable of predicting the approximate UMF activity in both active and inactive manuka and kanuka honey samples. The leaf oil profiles of manuka (L. scoparium) plants that yielded active and inactive manuka honeys were characterized using an adaption of the micro-scale extraction and GC/FID or GC/MS, technique developed by Brophy et al. (1989). Six major groups of volatile (steam distillable) compounds (monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes [excluding eudesmols], eudesmols, triketones, and nor-triketones) and 3 groups of non-volatile or semi-volatile compounds (flavonoids, grandiflorone and nor-grandiflorone) were recognized in the leaf oil components.

40|$|The cloud {{condensation}} nuclei {{activity of}} organic coated ammonium sulfate particles was studied using a CCN counter {{in conjunction with}} the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer. The organic coatings studied were adipic acid, <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> (DEHS) and stearic acid. 	It was found, that the CCN activity of ammonium sulfate particles decreased as a function of insoluble (stearic, DEHS) and slightly soluble (adipic) organic coating {{on the surface of the}} aerosol particles. Due to the liquid state of DEHS, water molecules diffused through the coating and caused a slight increase in the critical supersaturation. Water was unable to diffuse through the thick and insoluble coating of stearic acid and caused the CCN activation of the ammonium sulfate core to be suppressed within the parameters of this experiment...|$|E
40|$|Long-chain monocarboxylic, omega-hydroxymonocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids were {{activated}} approximately at {{the same}} rate by rat liver homogenates into their CoA esters (2 - 3 U/g liver). These acyl-CoA were substrates for rat liver peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The distribution of the peroxisomal oxidation of these substrates was also studied in various tissues. Rat liver mitochondria were capable of oxidizing long-chain monocarboxyl- and omega-hydroxymonocarboxylyl-CoAs but not dicarboxylyl-CoAs. When the mitochondrial preparations were incubated in coupling conditions, the addition of either free decanoic acid or free 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid resulted in an increase of the oxygen uptake conversely to the addition of <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The comparative study of the chain-length substrate specificity of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities revealed that, actually, both types of organelles, peroxisomes and mitochondria, contain "oxido-reductases" active on long-chain monocarboxylyl-CoAs, omega-hydroxymonocarboxylyl-CoAs and dicarboxylyl-CoAs...|$|E

40|$|Diesters of {{sebacic acid}} find various {{applications}} as plasticizers, solvents, and lubricants. Noncatalytic esterification of dibasic acids under near-critical and supercritical alcohol conditions was {{conducted for the}} first time. Esterification of sebacic acid (<b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid)</b> and methanol was chosen as a candidate reaction. The effect of molar ratio of methanol to sebacic acid, temperature, addition of water, and pressure was studied on the yields of the diesters and monoesters. A maximum molar yield of 87 % with a selectivity of 16 between monoester and diester was obtained at 623 K with a molar ratio of 5 : 1 within a reaction time of 25 min. A kinetic model was developed to correlate the experimental data, and activation energies were computed using the Arrhenius equation.

30|$|In addition, the formed {{decanoic acid}} was {{probably}} hydroxylated at its ω-end {{resulting in the}} formation of 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid which was further oxidized to the respective dicarboxylic acid <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> (11). Decandioic acid was degraded by β-oxidation which was confirmed by (De Boer and Backer [1956]) detection of its C 2 shortened intermediates until hexandioic acid. Therefore a diterminal degradation took place what has been previously reported for the filamentious fungus Mortierella isabellina, the bacteria Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Corynebacterium spp. {{as well as for the}} yeasts Candida guilliermondii and Candida spp. (Coon [2005]; Kester and Foster [1963]; Krauel et al. [1973]; Watkinson and Morgan [1991]). At least some of the intermediates of the β-oxidation of this dicarboxylic acid were detected in the cultures of all investigated yeasts. The formation of dicarboxylic acids ranging from six to 12 carbons from dodecane for C. tropicalis and from 12 to 16 carbons from the respective alkanes for Y. lipolytica has already been reported (Picataggio et al.

The esterification reaction of naturally occurring 3 -phenyl-prop- 2 -en- 1 -ol and different chain lengths acidic and diol reagents was carried out at the temperature of 140 °C under solvent free conditions. As acidic reagents, oxolane- 2, 5 -dione, oxane- 2, 6 -dione, hexanedioic acid and <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> were applied. Ethane- 1, 2 -diol and 2, 2 ʹ-[oxybis(2, 1 -ethandiyloxy) ]diethanol were used as diol reagents.

40|$|Sebacic (<b>decanedioic)</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{dicarboxylic acid}} {{proposed}} recently {{as an alternative}} energy substrate in total parenteral nutrition. In this paper, binding of sebacic acid to defatted human plasma albumin, also {{in the presence of}} decanoic acid, was studied by means of equilibrium dialysis. In addition, the binding of sebacic acid in human serum was investigated. Binding to defatted albumin was analysed by a model with two independent classes of sites with different affinity constants. The fitting procedure took into account some of the measurement errors that are likely to affect the equilibrium dialysis technique. We found for sebacic acid one binding site with affinity constant 3. 69 x 10 (4) M- 1 and four to five sites with affinity constant 7. 14 x 10 (2) M- 1. Association constants for decanoic acid are 3 - 4 -fold larger than those of sebacic acid. Data of binding of sebacic acid in human serum suggested that only three to five of the low affinity sites are available for binding.

40|$|Dicarboxylic acids are {{prominent}} features of several diseases, including Reye's syndrome. Long-chain dicarboxylic acids have profound {{effects on the}} function and structure of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that they could contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction in Reye's syndrome. Binding of fatty acids to albumin and the intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins is important in regulating the transport and metabolism of fatty acids and protects against the toxic effects of unbound fatty acids. We studied the binding of dicarboxylic acids to defatted albumin using equilibrium dialysis to assess to what extent dicarboxylic acids {{are likely to be}} bound in the plasma of patients. Dicarboxylic acids bind weakly to albumin in a molar ratio of 3. 8, 4. 2, 1. 6, 0. 8, and 0. 7 to 1 for octadecanedioic, hexadecanedioic, tetradecanedioic, dodecanedioic, and <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. The dissociation constants for long-chain dicarboxylic acids are 100 - 1, 000 -fold larger than those of comparable monocarboxylic acids. Oleate competes with dicarboxylic acid and reduces the moles of dicarboxylic acid bound per mol of albumin to < 1. Octanoate inhibits dicarboxylic acid binding. Our observations indicate that in Reye's syndrome, substantial concentrations of dicarboxylic acids of patients may be free and potentially toxic to mitochondria and other cellular processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{identification}} of new contaminants {{is critical in}} the development of new medicinal products. Many impurities, such as pentanedioic acid, hexanedioic acid, heptanedioic acid, octanedioic acid, <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid, tridecanedioic acid, and tetradecanedioic acid, have been identified in samples of azelaic acid. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify impurities observed during the stability tests of a new liposomal dosage form of azelaic acid that is composed of phosphati-dylcholine and a mixture of ethyl alcohol and water, using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD), gas chromatography–flame ionisation detection (GC-FID), and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. During the research and development of a new liposomal formulation of azelaic acid, we developed a method for determining the contamination of azelaic acid using HPLC-ELSD. During our analytical tests, we identified a previ-ously unknown impurity of a liposomal preparation of azelaic acid that appeared in the liposomal formulation of azelaic acid during preliminary stability studies. The procedure led to the conclusion that the impurity was caused by the reaction of azelaic acid with one of the excipients that was applied in the product. The impurity was finally identified as an ethyl monoester of azelaic acid.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is described to capture nano-size aerosols on internally-cooled micro tubing of the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) device followed by convenient {{introduction of the}} collected analytes into analytical instrument. Particles were generated using an aerosol formation by homogeneous nucleation of an organic vapor, and subsequent growth to nano-size particles by coagulation of <b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> bis[2 -ethylhexyl] ester (DEHS). The approach was validated by using carbon dioxide-cooled micro tubing to collect the nanosize DEHS particles followed by analyses on GC-flame ionization detector (FID). Particle size ranged from 150 to 590 nm. Temperature difference between the SPME device and DEHS particles mixture created a temperature gradient and resulted in thermophoretic effect that was determining the extraction rate. SPME device was cooled to as low as - 75 degrees C, while the DEHS remained close to room temperature. Several aspects of nanoparticle sampling were tested to demonstrate {{the principle of the}} sampling approach. These included the effects of thermal gradient, sample flow rate, sampling time, CO 2 delivery mode (constant coolant delivery vs. constant temperature), and particle size. Results were normalized to measure particulate concentrations using direct sampling with PTFE filters. Nanoparticle extractions of DEHS mass were proportional to sampling time. Normalized mass of DEHS extracted increased with increase in temperature gradient and with increase of the cross flow velocity. Preliminary results indicate that the variation of heat transfer boundary layer caused by the variation in the cross flow velocity produce self-compensating effect at constant coolant delivery, indicating that this approach could be used for field determinations including the time-weighted average sampling of nanoparticles. Thus, {{it may be possible to}} develop simple device based on this concept for field applications...|$|E

Three different fatty acids with varying chain length of suberic acid (octanedioic acid), sebacic acid (<b>decanedioic</b> <b>acid),</b> and dodecanedioic acid {{were used for the}} conjugation with the nucleosides. Among all the compounds, 52 ̆ 6 feet;- O-suberate derivative of AZT (1, EC 50 = 0. 10 nM) exhibited the best anti-HIV profile when compared to other fatty acyl derivatives. The compound showed 80 -fold higher anti-HIV activity than AZT without any significant toxicity (TC 50 3 ̆e 500 nM). In the second Manuscript, synthesis, anti-HIV activity, and preformulation tests of poly-L-arginine cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) conjugated with fatty acyl derivatives of anti-HIV nucleosides, FLT, lamivudine (3 TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) are discussed. All conjugates exhibited less anti-HIV activity when compared with the parent nucleoside analogues. For example, poly-L-arginine-fatty acyl derivative of 32 ̆ 6 feet;-fluoro- 32 ̆ 6 feet;-deoxythymidine, FLT-CO-(CH 2) 12 -CO-(Arg) 7, exhibited EC 50 values of 2. 9 µM and 3. 1 µM against X 4 and R 5 cell-free virus, respectively, while the FLT had EC 50 values of 0. 2 µM and 0. 1 µM, suggesting the limited uptake or intracellular hydrolysis to the parent analogue. Further preformulation studies were done on the FLT-conjugate by determining the lipid solubility (partition coefficient) and solution state degradation. The compound was found to be stable in acidic and alkaline conditions. The partition coefficient (Log P) of FLT conjugate was found to be - 0. 34. The derivative was also evaluated in dissolution studies using four different hydrogels with and without a thermogelling polymer. Gel formulations of the compound were manufactured using non-ionic (HPC-SL) and anionic (Carbopol) polymers with and without the inclusion of a thermo-reversible gelling (Pluronic F- 127) polymer.
