5000|$|Pruning shears, {{also called}} <b>hand</b> <b>pruners</b> (in American English), or secateurs, are {{a type of}} {{scissors}} for use on plants. They {{are strong enough to}} prune hard branches of trees and shrubs, sometimes up to two centimetres thick. They are used in gardening, arboriculture, farming, flower arranging, and nature conservation, where fine-scale habitat management is required.|$|E
50|$|Arborists, orchardists, and gardeners use various {{garden tools}} and tree cutting tools {{designed}} for the purpose, such as <b>hand</b> <b>pruners,</b> loppers, or chainsaws. Additionally in forestry bush saws are commonly used and these are often attached to poles that reach up to 5-6m, {{this is a more}} efficient way of pruning than with ladders. These bush saws on polls have also been motorized as chainsaws which is even more efficient. Older technology used Billhooks, Kaiser blades and pruning knives. Although still used in some coppicing they are not used so much in commercial forestry due to the difficulty of cutting flush with the stem. Flush cuts lead to good wood, non-flush or bark damaging cuts (which are more likely with a swung blade than a sawed one) put the tree at risk of entry cords from forest pathogens.|$|E
5000|$|Seed {{libraries}} have {{cropped up}} {{as a part}} of public library collections. Many have a policy for users who 'check out' seeds for a growing season; they agree to plant the checked-out seeds and then save seeds from the yield to return to the collection for the following year. Some seed libraries have become a point of contention with state governments' agriculture departments. Agricultural equipment, landscaping tools, and gardening supplies are also included in 'things' collections, and may include rakes, hedge trimmers, <b>pruners,</b> <b>hand</b> tools, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers. Some libraries are even creating community gardens where library users can check out a garden plot for a growing season.|$|R
