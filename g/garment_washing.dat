30|$|In this paper, {{the term}} novel design refers to {{eco-friendly}} sustainable apparel design {{which is the}} new challenge for apparel designers and producers, because the consumers are concerned in eco-fashion in the last decade. In the fast changing fashion trends, all are now motivated to practice sustainability in design and production throughout the textiles like the use of organic fibers and environmentally safe dyes and chemicals (Gam & Banning 2011). In this regards, enzymatic treatment in denim <b>garment</b> <b>washing</b> is eco-friendly and effective for production sustainable denim garment. Again, consumers’ environmental attitudes and apparel purchasing behavior has been increased now and their purchasing behavior is also influenced by the aesthetic attributes of the product (Butler & Francis 1997; Eckman 1997). Therefore, enzymatic wash is very much effective to attract the customers, retailers, fashion marketers as well as denim apparel designers and producers.|$|E

30|$|Denim garment (Jeans) washing {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{finishing}} treatments that have vast usage, due to its effects on appearance and comfort. Without washing, the denim garment is uncomfortable to wear, due to its weaving and dyeing effects. It essentially needs a finishing treatment to make it softer, more supple and smooth which enhance wearer’s comfort. Popularity of <b>garment</b> <b>washing</b> especially of denim garment in the world market has been increasing day by day (Islam 2010). To keep up with the quickly changing of demands of customers, technologists are experimenting with new design and fashions by using different washing methods for denim garments. The most commonly used denim washing methods are enzyme wash, bleach wash, acid wash, normal wash, stone wash, etc. (Islam 2010; Kashem 2008). Among the washing methods, enzymatic methods are the most widely used method in industry (Buchert & Heikinheimo 1998; Duran & Mercela 2000; Kochavi et al. 1990; Tyndall 1990).|$|E

40|$|Burdens to the {{environment}} with industrialization have extended {{to a greater extent}} than the assimilating capacity of it. The textile wet processing is a heavy consumer of water and energy. It also discharges environmentally hazardous substances. But the apparel sector with their affiliated <b>garment</b> <b>washing</b> and dyeing plants is one of the main income generators in Sri Lanka. Hence the discovery of any mean to mitigate those impacts while sustaining the industry would be immensely useful. This study has focused on two main approaches to accomplish the sustainable development in the garment dyeing facility. The approaches are maximizing Right First Time dyeing and Implementation of the Cleaner production options. Majority of the textile dyeing plants in Sri Lanka does not maintain any statistics on Right First Time dyeing. The percentage is acutely low in Garment dyeing. The root causes for the dyeing defects and shade variations in the dyed garments are analyzed in detail in this study. Cause and effect diagram, which is considered to be a powerful tool among seven quality tools, was used here as the tool for the analysis. Preventive measures are suggested for each root cause, subsequently. Application of Cleaner Production options to the industry is another approach for the sustainable development. The novel technologies, which are affordable, such as Ultra low liquor ratio machines, improved efficient washing systems, were deeply reviewed in this study. Switching on to such technology changes is utmost important for industries in order to, not only for {{the environment}}al compliance but also for sustainability in competitive global market. Modification of processes and formulas by critically analyzing them and making trials on them was another proven mean for the sustainability. Possibilities of implementing 3 R-Reduce, Reuse and Recycle on water and other resources were looked into in the project. Good house keeping procedures are highlighted options in Cleaner production and some of the quantified studies have been covered in this project. Plenty of new options in material substitutions, Process controls, new byproducts etc. are also suggested for the industries to implement in order to demonstrate world-class ecologically sound performance...|$|E

40|$|Textile and garment Industry is an {{important}} industry sector in the Sri Lankan economy. The finishing part comprises the final step in textile processing and it {{is known as a}} sector with high polluting potential. In the textile washing sector considerable quantities of water is used only once usually and is discharged without any recovery. To stay competitive this industry needs to be modernized and definitely needs better performance in the environmental management sector. This project was limited to looking at the environmental management aspects and that too with only a single pollutant stream -water. The sector of the textile industry considered is the textile washing industry. A <b>garment</b> <b>washing</b> plant is analyzed with the objective of promoting water recycling and waste minimization practices. Initially typical practices were reported, followed by a water balance for the system. Results of the water audit presented here forms the first essential element of the waste minimization process. Water stream is considered from the inlet to the exit, and the consideration is given to methods of conservation possible of this valuable natural resource while obtaining the optimal use in the process. The time that water was assumed to be a limitless low-cost resource has already passed. Today there is an increasing awareness of the danger to the environment caused by over-extraction and use of water. There is now considerable incentive to reduce both consumption and waste water production. The selection of the washing industry was selected for this study under that consideration. This industry sector today uses significant quantities of water and most of the factories neither utilize waste minimization nor water recycling techniques. The waste treatment methods are also not adequate. Thus there is a tremendous potential on savings on one hand and a need on the other hand. It was shown that it is feasible to utilize groundwater after treatment. Manganese is not appearing to be a major problem. The problem chemical appears to be the presence of iron. Iron can be removed from groundwater using several operations. This eliminates the transport of water from outside and serves many environmental needs such as reduced traffic, removing reliance on outside sources and events etc. A pilot plant was constructed in the laboratory and four methods of iron removal were analyzed. Ozonation was studied as a method of reducing this wastage. In this manner there would be a reduced demand on the freshwater resource as well as reduced discharge of effluents. Thus the situation would lead to a facility whereby the waste minimization has taken place and a facility with positive environmental management. It has been shown that this technology offers many advantages to the industry including the recycling option. Ozonation in addition provided abilities to provide the required input quality as well in addition to being able to reduce COD, BOD and the most importantly Color of effluents. It was seen that processes are carried out with less attention being paid to the overall efficiencies but only towards meeting production targets and/or meeting deadlines. The feasibility of recycling waste water was shown. The practice of this would be a major improvement on the current environmental performance...|$|E

In response, Government funded clothing longevity research seeks to develop and test industry-led design strategies to influence and enable consumers to keep garments in active use for longer (Cooper et al., 2014). While recent UK research has indicated significant potential to influence more sustainable consumer behaviour (Langley et al., 2013; YouGov, 2012), up-to-date qualitative research is required to discover how consumer attitudes, expectations and behaviours in relation to clothing lifetimes affects garment care and clothing use. This will help to inform industry-led strategies by understanding where effective changes can be made that will potentially have most impact.

The study was carried out to elucidate the reasons for the accelerated colour loss of cotton <b>garments</b> <b>washed</b> under Australian domestic laundering conditions. Cotton fabric dyed with commonly used reactive dyes were laundered with water only, several domestic detergents and a laboratory formulated neutral detergent, and then exposed to light for two hours in the wet state. Quantities of detergent used were in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations. Exposures were repeated fifteen times equivalent to 30 hours exposure. Colour loss and colour difference were measured after 5, 10 and 15 wash cycles and 10, 20 and 30 hours exposure. When the fabric was exposed wet the colour faded more rapidly than when exposed dry to light. Detergents increased the colour loss even when the fabric was not exposed to light. The presence of an oxidizing bleach (sodium perborate) in the detergent increased colour loss during washing and wet exposure to light. Ultraviolet radiation from the light source, heat, moisture, alkali and oxidising bleach during exposure resulted in hydrolysis of the dye-fibre bond causing dye desorption during washing and rinsing. Water alone increased the fading of the dyes most likely due to presence of dissolved oxygen held within the fibre. The combination of ultraviolet radiation and oxidizing bleaches altered the chemistry of the dye and hence its shade. This was particularly evident on the black dye and one of the navy blue dyes...|$|R
