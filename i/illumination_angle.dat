50|$|A Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO, {{also called}} a heliosynchronous orbit) is a near polar orbit around Earth (also called geocentric orbit) {{in which the}} {{satellite}} passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites. More technically, it is an orbit arranged {{in such a way}} that it precesses once a year. The surface <b>illumination</b> <b>angle</b> will be nearly the same every time that the satellite is overhead. This consistent lighting is a useful characteristic for satellites that image the Earth's surface in visible or infrared wavelengths (e.g. weather and spy satellites) and for other remote sensing satellites (e.g. those carrying ocean and atmospheric remote sensing instruments that require sunlight). For example, a satellite in sun-synchronous orbit might ascend across the equator twelve times a day each time at approximately 15:00 mean local time. This is achieved by having the osculating orbital plane precess (rotate) approximately one degree each day with respect to the celestial sphere, eastward, to keep pace with the Earth's movement around the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Face {{detection}} and recognition {{is becoming increasingly}} important in the contexts of surveillance, credit card fraud detection, assistive devices for visual impaired, etc. A number of face recognition algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The availability of a comprehensive face database is crucial to test the performance of these face recognition algorithms. However, while existing publicly-available face databases contain face images {{with a wide variety}} of poses <b>angles,</b> <b>illumination</b> <b>angles,</b> gestures, face occlusions, and illuminant colors, these images have not been adequately annotated, thus limiting their usefulness for evaluating the relative performance of face detection algorithms. For example, many of the images in existing databases are not annotated with the exact pose angles at which they were taken. In order to compare the performance of various face recognition algorithms presented in the literature there is a need for a comprehensive, systematically annotated database populated with face images that have been captured (1) at a variety of pose angles (to permit testing of pose invariance), (2) {{with a wide variety of}} <b>illumination</b> <b>angles</b> (to permit testing of illumination invariance), and (3) under a variety of commonly encountered illumination color temperatures (to permit testing of illumination color invariance). In this paper, we present a methodology for creating such an annotated database that employs a novel set of apparatus for the rapid capture of face images from a wide variety of pose <b>angles</b> and <b>illumination</b> <b>angles.</b> Four different types of illumination are used, including daylight, skylight, incandescent and fluorescent.

50|$|The sensor {{consisted}} of a catadioptric telescope with an aperture of 46 mm and fused silica lenses focused onto a coated Thompson CCD camera with a bandpass of 250 - 1000 nm and a six-position filter wheel. The wavelength response was limited on the short wavelength end by the transmission and optical blur of the lens, and on the long end by the CCD response. The CCD was a frame transfer device which allowed three gain states (150, 350, and 1000 electrons/bit). Integration times varied from 1 - 40 ms depending on gain state, solar <b>illumination</b> <b>angle,</b> and filter. The filter center wavelengths (and bandpass widths (FWHM)) were 415 nm (40 nm), 750 nm (10 nm), 900 nm (30 nm), 950 nm (30 nm), 1000 nm (30 nm), and a broad-band filter covering 400 - 950 nm. The field of view was 4.2 &times; 5.6 degrees, translating to a cross-track width of about 40 km at a nominal 400 km lunar altitude. The image array was 288 &times; 384 pixels. Pixel resolution varied from 100 - 325 m during a single orbit mapping run at the Moon. At Geographos the pixel resolution would have been 25 m at the 100 km closest approach, giving an image size about 7 &times; 10 km. The camera took twelve images in each 1.3 s image burst, which occurred 125 times over the 80-minute mapping span during each five-hour lunar orbit. the Moon's surface was covered completely during the two-month lunar mapping phase of the mission. The dynamic range was 15,000. The signal-to-noise ratio varied from 25 - 87 depending on the surface albedo and phase angle, with a relative calibration of 1% and an absolute calibration of 15%.|$|E
