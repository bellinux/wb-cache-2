SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of amphibians at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E

5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

25|$|In certain regions, such as Hawaii and {{northern}} Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed.

25|$|Major {{historical}} {{sources for}} the period include the chronicles of Theophanes the Confessor and the Patriarch Nikephoros, {{both of whom were}} ardent iconodules. Many historians have also drawn on hagiography, most notably the Life of St. Stephen the Younger, which includes a detailed, but highly biased, account of persecutions during the reign of Constantine V. No account of the period in question written by an iconoclast has been preserved, although certain saints' lives <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> preserve elements of the iconoclast worldview.|$|E

25|$|Today's {{critics of}} Voltaire's opinion are {{directed}} primarily at his economic {{assessment of the}} Canadian colony. Voltaire’s idea of the Canadian colony based essentially on fur trade was, even {{at the time of}} his own writings, already outdated by almost a century. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly what part of his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, to attachment to a preconceived idea or to mere misinformation, his few writings on the subject <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> display a certain level of short-sightedness regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had, by then, already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony’s potential for further development.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the {{communal}} disharmony and violence between Hindus and Muslims {{goes back to the}} history of several centuries. Historical analysis of Hindu-Muslim conflict has been highly contentious. Contemporary historians of India do not even agree that there were Hindu or Muslim communal identities before the nineteenth century. Historians like Sarkar view Hindu-Muslim conflict as essentially modern phenomena as communal riots <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been significantly rare down to the 1880s. However, on the other side are historians who argue that Hindu-Muslim conflict has a longer history and, according some arguments, extends into the early period of Mughal rule. According to this view, inter-religious strife and riots which resemble contemporary Hindu-Muslim conflict were present, even endemic, in pre-modern times.|$|E
25|$|Norman Le Brocq of the Jersey Communist Party (JCP) led a {{resistance}} group called Jersey Democratic Movement (JDM). The resistance helped {{many of the}} Soviet forced labourers that the Germans had brought to the island. JDM, the JCP and Transport and General Workers’ Union distributed propaganda. With {{the aid of a}} German deserter, Paul Mulbach, they apparently had some success in turning the soldiers of the garrison against their masters, including most notably the highest military authority in the Islands, Huffmeier. There is some evidence to suggest that they had even set a date for this mutiny (1 May 1945) but that it was rendered pointless by the suicide of Adolf Hitler. Peter Tabb suggests that they were involved in the blowing up of the Palace Hotel and of separate ammo dumps, in actual fact {{it is more likely that}} their involvement was to set fire to the hotel, and the German efforts to put out the subsequent blaze, by using dynamite to create a breach between the flames were misjudged and set off charges in a neighbouring ammo dump. Nevertheless, the JCP <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have made many plans for organised resistance.|$|E

[...] Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, [...] "their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television".
