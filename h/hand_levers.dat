50|$|Bennett's team at RM custom-milled the Tomahawk {{components}} from {{blocks of}} aluminum. Under the seat are two alloy pieces that began as 750 lb billets that are machined down to 25 lb each, and polished to a mirror finish.

50|$|In {{common with}} most Manx stations, it never had full sized platforms, {{but there were}} half-height ones {{reaching}} {{as far as the}} bottom running board of the coaches. On {{the south side of the}} main platform there was also a long bay platform. In common with most of the island's railway system points and signals were not fully interlocked, but controlled by individual <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> Therefore, there was no signal box or groundframe.|$|E

50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> {{to control}} the {{throttle}}. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> to set the minimum throttle. This was an early form of cruise control. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake {{to the right and}} left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.|$|R
50|$|This {{accident}} {{happened because}} the points were not fully interlocked, and were merely {{a kind of}} power-assisted <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> with automatic normalisation.|$|R
50|$|For the 1921 Indianapolis 500 small {{rear wheels}} brakes only were fitted. Subsequently, Isotta Fraschini-type front wheel brakes {{actuated}} by <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> rear brakes actuated by right pedal.|$|R
50|$|At a {{time when}} most hang gliders used a {{flexible}} Rogallo wing, Icarus I used a rigid flying wing biplane configuration. Unlike other hang gliders of the time, the Icarus was not steered by the pilot shifting his body weight. Instead, Icarus I had two large rudders mounted near the wing tips, controlled by <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> These rudders made Icarus I much more maneuverable than other hang gliders. Pitch was controlled by the pilot shifting his body weight fore and aft. The pilot flew in a reclining position, rather than the prone position used by other hang gliders.|$|E
50|$|The Points Box {{remained}} in use until {{the summer of}} 1970 when the point work of the Port Erin arrival platform and its associated signals were disconnected. These points were then controlled with <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> and the signals were placed permanently in the 'off' position so that trains could arrive and depart without the box being manned, saving the associated wage costs. Thereafter, it was used only for more complicated shunting movements in which case it would be manned {{by a member of}} the train crew or the stationmaster. The remainder was taken out of use in 1979/80 when the old Port Erin Platforms - 5 & 6 - were removed and the area cleared for parking.|$|E
50|$|Some early manned flight {{attempts}} {{may have}} been intended to achieve flapping-wing flight, though probably only a glide was actually achieved. These include the purported flights of the 11th-century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury (recorded in the 12th century) and the 9th-century poet Abbas Ibn Firnas (recorded in the 17th century). Roger Bacon, writing in 1260, was also {{among the first to}} consider a technological means of flight. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci began to study the flight of birds. He grasped that humans are too heavy, and not strong enough, to fly using wings simply attached to the arms. He therefore sketched a device in which the aviator lies down on a plank and works two large, membranous wings using <b>hand</b> <b>levers,</b> foot pedals, and a system of pulleys.|$|E
50|$|When {{this type}} of valve is tripped, the flow is quickly stopped and an {{indicator}} disc tells the operator that the electrical circuit has been opened by a failure somewhere in the system. When the system failure has been corrected so that the circuit is again closed, the valve can be opened {{by the action of}} the <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> If, however, the system failure has not been satisfactorily corrected, the circuit will remain open and moving the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> will not open the valve, because the valve stem remains disengaged from the handle.|$|R
50|$|The brakes are all two piston design. Both front brakes are {{activated}} {{by the right}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> The rear brake is {{activated by}} the foot pedal on the right.|$|R
25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all wheels. Trailer air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|R
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance {{wheels of the}} trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box {{containing}} the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle {{to the line of}} the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle valve, link rod, brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although <b>hand</b> <b>levers</b> were also provided.|$|E
5000|$|In 1818, British {{inventor}} Denis Johnson patented {{his approach}} to designing tricycles. In 1876, James Starley developed the Coventry Lever Tricycle, which used two small wheels {{on the right side}} and a large drive wheel on the left side; power was supplied by <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> In 1877, Starley developed a new vehicle he called the Coventry Rotary, which was [...] "one of the first rotary chain drive tricycles." [...] Starley's inventions started a tricycling craze in Britain; by 1879, there were [...] "twenty types of tricycles and multi-wheel cycles ... produced in Coventry, England, and by 1884, there were over 120 different models produced by 20 manufacturers." [...] The first front steering tricycle was manufactured in 1881 by The Leicester Safety Tricycle Company of Leicester, England, which was brought to the market in 1882 costing £18. They also developed a folding tricycle at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicles used in sailing {{are known}} as sail wagons, sand yachts, or land yachts. They {{typically}} have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or <b>hand</b> <b>levers.</b> Land sailing works best in windy flat areas, and races often happen on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Modern land sailors, generally known as [...] "pilots", can go {{three to four times}} faster than the wind speed. A gust of wind is considered more beneficial in a land sailing race than a favorable windshift. A similar sport, known as ice yachting, is practiced on frozen lakes and rivers. Another variation is the Whike, which combines land sailing with bicycling and can therefore also be used in everyday traffic because it does not fully depend on wind.|$|E
5000|$|The front brakes are two-piston design, {{while the}} single rear caliper houses four pistons. Both front brakes are {{activated}} {{by the right}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b> The rear brake is activated by the foot pedal on the right.|$|R
50|$|The Topper had 5 inch {{internal}} expanding {{drum brakes}} on both wheels. The front brake {{was controlled by}} a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> on the left handlebar with a parking brake lock; the rear brake was controlled by a pedal.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the valve spindle. A <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the valve drive and promptly stopping the engine.|$|R

40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system in an all-terrain four-wheeled vehicle with independent suspension where the necessary forces for wheels to respond to steering control is supplied by fluid pressure or electrical actuators mounted parallel to the suspension arm between vehicle frame and wheel control arm. Steering control by the driver is by manipulation of right and/or left steering levers eliminating the need of steering wheel and steering column {{in front of the}} driver. The steering actuators are independent and there is no tracking rod or other linkage for coordinating their turning angles. Close coordination of the wheel turning angles for achieving the Ackerman angle relation or other non-linear turning angle relation between the wheels is by a now-linear linkage between left and right steering levers or elsewhere or by a computer control for electric actuators. Optionally, a computer control in an electrical system has inputs for acceleration and velocity for detecting hazards associated with steering and inputs to provide artificial feel signals to the <b>hand</b> <b>levers...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia mopeds were powered with a 47cc Sachs 505/1A, though some were {{powered by a}} Solo motor. Even though the Sachs 505/1A motor is designed for rear coaster-brakes, Columbia chose to use a Magura <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> and cable for the rear brake.|$|R
5000|$|... "The engine a {{sets the}} face plate b, {{which serves as}} the flywheel, into motion and the {{rotation}} is transferred to the discus wheel c. Through this the shaft dd with the sprocket turns. Thus the chain e drives the rear axle. The speed is adjusted by shifting the discus wheel c on the shaft dd {{by means of the}} <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> fastened {{to the left of the}} upper end of the steering column and the articulated lever f. The bearings of the shaft dd with the discus wheel c can be shifted forwards and backwards carriage-like by the <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> g to the right of the driver's seat. By means of this <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> the discus wheel c is engaged with the face plate b and the engine, or idling, pressed backwards against the brake arm f to brake the car. So this lever serves both to brake and to engage the clutch. Independently of the aforementioned brake there are two band brakes r1 and r2 on both rear wheels. The beehive radiator n cools the cylinders by means of the belt-driven pump l. The chassis is made of iron-reinforced wood. The front axle is straight, the rear axle is full-length and has no differential." ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the term}} {{can refer to}} any small {{printing}} press or machine intended for such work, it most commonly refers to a class of small, vertical platen presses.Depending on the time-period when the machine was made, they may be operated by treadle, line shaft, electricity, or by <b>hand</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Transmission brakes use drum brakes, {{rather than}} disc brakes, {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic brake. Drum brakes allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
5000|$|The T engine had one carburetor, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and {{throttle}} valves {{were controlled}} manually; {{the latter was}} with a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no accelerator pump. Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston.|$|R
50|$|A pedal {{operates}} {{shoes in}} enclosed drums {{at the rear}} and a centrally set <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> applies a locomotive type of transmission brake which is anchored to the gear box. Hand adjusters are provided. Compensation is given by rubber washers. The rear-wheel brakes can also be taken up by hand on the primary rod.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{there is}} some {{passenger}} or freight traffic on only two short sections. On the western section between Hollenbek and Ratzeburg, Erlebnisbahn Ratzeburg has operated a seasonal operation with rides on a <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> trolley (draisine) since 1998. In addition the track is maintained to promote its re-commissioning for the operation of Regionalbahn services.|$|R

50|$|The chassis had rigid {{front and}} rear axles and leaf springs all round. Early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels {{operated}} by a <b>hand</b> <b>lever,</b> with a pedal-operated transmission brake acting on the propeller shaft. The footbrake system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913. Four-wheel servo-assisted brakes became optional in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The worm and sector {{steering}} box was {{fixed to the}} engine and received lubrication from it. All four wheels had internally expanding brakes. The <b>hand</b> <b>lever</b> operated only the back pair. Unconventional in action it was simplified for the following Motor Show. The front brakes used the Perrot system. The car's springs were all half-elliptical, flat-set and gaitered.|$|R
