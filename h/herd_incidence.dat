The present investigation included a retrospective case–control study to identify potential herd-level risk factors for M. bovis associated disease, and a prospective cohort study to evaluate the course of clinical disease in M. bovis infected dairy cattle herds in Switzerland. Eighteen herds with confirmed M. bovis cases were visited twice within an average interval of 75 d. One control herd with no history of clinical mycoplasmosis, matched for herd size, was randomly selected within a 10 km range for each case herd. Animal health data, production data, information on milking and feeding-management, housing and presence of potential stress- factors were collected. Composite quarter milk samples were aseptically collected from all lactating cows and 5 % of all animals within each herd were sampled by nasal swabs. Organ samples of culled diseased cows were collected when logistically possible. All samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In case <b>herds,</b> <b>incidence</b> risk of pneumonia, arthritis and clinical mastitis prior to the first visit and incidence rates of clinical mastitis and clinical pneumonia between the two visits was estimated.

This study aimed to demonstrate the usefulness in a specific clinical context of a simulation-based technique called probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) in interpreting the results of a discrete time survival model based on a large dataset of routinely collected dairy herd management data. Data from 12, 515 dairy cows (from 39 herds) were used to construct a multilevel discrete time survival model in which the outcome was the probability of a cow becoming pregnant during a given two day period of risk, and presence or absence of a recorded lameness event during various time frames relative to the risk period amongst the potential explanatory variables. A separate simulation model was then constructed to evaluate the wider clinical implications of the model results (i. e. the potential for a <b>herd’s</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of lameness to influence its overall reproductive performance) using PSA. Although the discrete time survival analysis revealed some relatively large associations between lameness events and risk of pregnancy (for example, occurrence of a lameness case within 14 days of a risk period was associated with a 25 % reduction in the risk of the cow becoming pregnant during that risk period), PSA revealed that, when viewed {{in the context of a}} realistic clinical situation, a <b>herd’s</b> lameness <b>incidence</b> rate is highly unlikely to influence its overall reproductive performance to a meaningful extent in the vast majority of situations.

The present study used a spatial, stochastic epidemic simulation model to compare the effectiveness of emergency vaccination with conventional (non-vaccination) control measures in Switzerland, a low-livestock density country. Model results revealed that emergency vaccination with a radius of 3 km or 10 km around infected premises (IP) did not significantly reduce either the cumulative <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> or epidemic duration if started in a small epidemic situation where the number of IPs is still low.

The effect of different levels of conventional strategy measures was also explored for the non-vaccination strategy. It was found that a lower compliance level of farmers for movement restrictions and delayed culling of IPs significantly increased both the cumulative IP incidence and epidemic duration. Contingency management should therefore focus mainly on improving conventional strategies, by increasing disease awareness and communication with stakeholders and preparedness of culling teams in countries with a livestock structure similar to Switzerland; however, emergency vaccination should be considered if there are reasons to believe that the epidemic may become extensive, such as when disease detection has been delayed and many IPs are discovered at the beginning of the epidemic...|$|E

40|$|Routinely {{collected}} {{herd management}} {{data in a}} variety of formats were collated from 468 dairy herds, and novel objective measures of data recording quality were developed and applied. This revealed that there was a substantial amount of variation in data quality between herds, {{and the vast majority of}} herds failed to meet the threshold level for at least one of the data quality measures used. Analysis of trends in reproductive performance across the herds with good quality fertility event recording suggested that their fertility was generally declining through the first half of the 2000 s, but there was some evidence that improvements in submission rate were beginning to reverse this decline in the later years studied (up to 2007). Associations between reproduction and two endemic diseases common in dairy cattle (mastitis and lameness) were explored using multilevel discrete time survival modelling, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) used to contextualise and illustrate the results. In both cases, statistical modelling revealed significant and sizeable associations between disease events and reproductive outcomes at lactation level. However, simulation and application of PSA showed that a <b>herd’s</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of either disease was highly unlikely to influence its overall reproductive performance to a clinically relevant degree when other inputs to herd fertility were also considered. Factors associated with the proportion of serves leading to a pregnancy (pregnancy rate) were explored using multilevel logistic regression modelling. This revealed that relatively little of the variation in herd pregnancy rate is explainable by routinely recorded milk recording data (including constituent concentration in early lactation as well as daily and lactation yields). A large amount of the unexplained variation was revealed to be at herd level and very little at cow level, suggesting that investigation of herd management practices associated with pregnancy rate would be rewarding...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the predictive ability of the herd dry period (DP) intramammary infection (IMI) incidence and elimination rates derived from predry and postcalving somatic cell count (SCC) measurements [quarter-level SCC and dairy herd improvement (DHI) composite-level SCC] for monitoring the herd DP IMI incidence and elimination rates. A cohort of 91 Canadian dairy herds was followed from 2007 to 2008. In each herd, a sample of 15 cows was selected each year, and a series of 2 predry and 2 postcalving quarter milk samples were collected. Routine milk bacteriological culture was conducted to identify IMI, SCC was measured on the quarter milk samples, and composite SCC of the last predry and first postcalving DHI tests were obtained. Mastitis pathogens were grouped into 3 categories: major pathogens, minor pathogens, and any pathogens. For each herd, DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination rates were computed using quarter milk culture data. Similarly, SCC-derived <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> and elimination rates were computed using quarter and DHI composite-level SCC measurements and using various SCC thresholds to define new and eliminated IMI. Linear regression was used to compare herd quarter-level and composite-level SCC-derived <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> and elimination with DP bacteriological culture-derived IMI incidence and elimination. Herd DP incidences computed by using quarter-level SCC, and with most of the SCC thresholds tested, were significant predictors of the DP major, minor, and any IMI incidences (F-test; P≤ 0. 05). The highest coefficients of determination (R(2)) were obtained with thresholds of 200, 000 (R(2) : 12 %) and 50, 000 cells/mL (R(2) : 25 %) for predicting major and minor IMI, respectively. When using composite DHI SCC measurements, however, substantial losses of predictive power were seen for minor and any IMI incidences compared with quarter-level SCC. For DP major IMI incidence, composite SCC yielded similar, but modest, predictive power when a cutoff value of 150, 000 cells/mL was chosen to define new IMI. To predict DP elimination rates, the value of quarter-level SCC seemed limited to predicting the DP major IMI elimination rate. Composite SCC, on the other hand, showed modest predictive power for major and minor IMI elimination rates, with thresholds of 200, 000 and 50, 000 cells/mL, respectively. Results from the current study suggest that quarter and composite SCC-derived rates could be used as substitutes for bacteriological culture-derived rates for some groups of mastitis pathogens.

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} is {{an ongoing}} problem in Ireland, and <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> has remained at approximately 5 % for some years. Spillover of infection from cattle to people remains an ever-present possibility, given the ongoing pool of infection in the Irish cattle population. This paper describes an outbreak of tuberculosis affecting cattle and people on a dairy farm in southeastern Ireland following the consumption of milk from a seven-year-old cow with tuberculous mastitis. Twenty-five of 28 calves born during autumn 2004 and spring 2005 were subsequently identified as TB reactors, and five of six family members were positive on the Mantoux test. During 2005, milk from this cow had mainly been used to feed calves, and was added only occasionally to the bulk tank. Therefore, the calves each received infected milk on an almost continuous basis between birth and weaning. The family collected milk from the bulk milk tank, and consumed it without pasteurisation. This case highlights {{the risks associated with}} the consumption of raw milk. In this family, TB has had a very significant impact on the health of two young children. These risks are well recognised, and relevant information for farmers is available. It is of concern, therefore, that raw milk consumption remains prevalent on Irish farms.

40|$|The {{ability of}} dairy cattle {{to adapt to}} the natural change of energy balance in early {{lactation}} is an important aspect of the transition period, as the demands for milk production cannot be met by feed intake alone. Cattle unable to adequately transition from late gestation to early lactation are at a higher risk for subclinical ketosis (SCK), an excess of circulating ketone bodies without clinical signs of hyperketonemia. Cows with SCK are at an increased risk of postpartum diseases such as displaced abomasum and metritis, and SCK has been found to decrease milk yield in early lactation and may adversely affect reproduction. The objectives herein were to: 1) describe the epidemiology of SCK in cows diagnosed with SCK in early lactation; 2) determine important dry and parturient period risk factors of hyperketonemia development; 3) determine the effect of oral administration of propylene glycol in cows diagnosed with SCK on disease development, removal from the herd, reproduction, and milk production; and 4) estimate the cost per case of SCK and evaluate different on-farm testing and treatment strategies based on <b>herd</b> SCK <b>incidence.</b> Peak incidence and prevalence of SCK was found to occur at 5 days in milk (DIM) with a median time to resolution of 5 days. Cows developing SCK from 3 to 7 DIM were more likely to suffer from negative disease and production outcomes than cows that developed SCK from 8 to 16 DIM. Treatment of SCK positive cows with propylene glycol decreased disease incidence, improved reproduction, and enhanced milk production over non-treated control cows. Risk factors associated with development of hyperketonemia included advanced parity, high prepartum non-esterified fatty acid concentrations, and calving difficulty. The cost per case of SCK in the first 30 DIM was estimated at $ 67. Testing of fresh cows 2 days per week from 3 through 9 DIM and treatment of SCK positive cows with propylene glycol was found to be the most cost-effective treatment in <b>herds</b> with SCK <b>incidences</b> between 15 and 50 %; above 50 % blanket treatment of all fresh cows with propylene glycol was more economically beneficial. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{infections that}} are {{typically}} asymptomatic, targeted surveillance systems (whereby individuals {{at increased risk}} are tested more frequently) will detect infections earlier on average than systems with random testing or in systems where all individuals are tested at the same intervals. However, estimating temporal trends in infection risk using data from such targeted surveillance systems can be challenging. This is similarly a problem for targeted surveillance to detect faults of individual industrial components. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in British cattle has been generally increasing in the last thirty years. Cattle herds are routinely tested for evidence {{of exposure to the}} aetiological bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, in a targeted surveillance programme in which the testing interval is determined by past local TB incidence and local veterinary discretion. The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) report the monthly percentage of tests on officially TB-free (OTF) herds resulting in a confirmed positive test for M. bovis (i. e. the percentage of tested herds with OTF status withdrawn), which contains substantial fluctuations (three years apart) within the increasing trend. As the number of herds tested changes over time, this cyclic trend is difficult to interpret. Here we evaluate an alternative to the Defra method in which we distribute each incident event across the period at risk to infer the underlying trends in infection incidence using a stochastic model of cattle <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> and testing frequencies fitted to data on the monthly number of herds tested and number of these with OTF status withdrawn in 2003 – 2010. We show that for an increasing underlying incidence trend, the current Defra approach can produce artefactual fluctuations whereas the alternative method described provides more accurate descriptions of the underlying risks over time...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two Costa Rican dairy herds were {{actively}} monitored for vesicular diseases between November 1991 and March 1992, {{in anticipation of}} the annual dry season occurrence of vesicular stomatitis (VS). Thirty-nine confirmed cases of VS were concentrated on nine farms, resulting in an average <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of 11. 1 % of mature cattle for the affected farms, or 2. 6 % for all farms. Affected cattle were generally older (average age = 5. 4 years), with seven-year-old cows having the highest age-specific incidence rate (6. 5 %). The New Jersey serotype of VS was diagnosed for all but four cases, primarily manifesting as teat vesicles. Cases had high acute and convalescent antibody titers for both major VS serotypes, New Jersey and Indiana, with significant titer increases after clinical disease. Screening and multiple variable regression analyses of 140 cow, farm, and ecologic variables revealed that clinical disease was significantly associated with cows being in lactation, and with higher acute antibody titers to serotype Indiana, but not with any predisposing diseases. Significant farm factors were the presence of poultry and a longer calving interval on the farm, but not higher rates of other diseases. According to a prior epidemiologic hypothesis, two ecologic factors were forced to be included into the farm model: the reported presence of sand flies, and a higher proportion of the farm being in forest land, with subsequent stepwise regression. The resulting model containing only the two forced variables was significant (P < 0. 003) and correctly classified 78 % of farms into the correct group, as compared with 79 % for the final stepwise model.

40|$|The <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> of {{confirmed}} Mycobacterium bovis {{infection in}} cattle in the south-west of England has been approximately ten {{times that of}} the remainder of England and Wales; this greater incidence has been attributed to infection from badgers. The incidence of herds with only non-visible lesioned tuberculin test reactors, from which M. bovis was not isolated, has also remained higher in the south-west region. The incidences of these latter unconfirmed incidents were compared in parishes in the south-west region in which M. bovis in cattle had been confirmed, and those where M. bovis had not been confirmed, for the period 1979 - 83. This analysis was carried out both for those parishes in which herds had been subjected to annual tuberculin testing and for those subjected to biennial tuberculin testing. The incidence of unconfirmed incidents was significantly higher in parishes in which confirmed incidents had occurred, and this difference was found in both the annual and biennially tested parishes. The relative risks for the incidence of unconfirmed incidents in annually and biennially tested parishes were 1. 89 and 2. 56, respectively. The incidence of unconfirmed incidents in biennially tested parishes was lower than in annually tested parishes. The incidence of non-specific tuberculin test reactor herds was estimated from tuberculin test results in the eastern region of England during a period when tuberculosis was not confirmed in cattle. A comparison of this incidence and that of unconfirmed incidents in the south-west region suggests that approximately 70 % of the unconfirmed incidents in the south-west were related to exposure to M. bovis. The results of the analyses indicate that unconfirmed incidents cannot be completely ignored in epidemiological analyses and studies of bovine tuberculosis in the problem areas of the south-west region of England...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence of anti-T. gondii in goats raised on farms in the Jenin and Tulkarm districts in the north of Palestine. The investigation was conducted on 14 herds comprising of 280 goats. Blood samples were collected via the jugular veins of 151 goats during the period from January to December 2011. The indirect ELISA test was used for the detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies. Results showed that an anti-T. gondii IgG antibody was detected in 13. 4 % of the samples. The presence of the anti-T. gondii antibody was influenced by the location of the goat <b>herds.</b> The highest <b>incidence</b> was in Jenin district (17. 44 %) while it was 7. 69 % in Tulkarm district. These results indicated the possible contamination of meat and milk of the goats with this parasite, which in turn negatively affects human health...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{incidence}} rate of clinical mastitis were studied in 274 Dutch dairy herds. Variables that {{were associated with}} resistance to disease were the feeding, housing, and milking machine factors. Variables that were associated with exposure were grazing, combined housing of dry cows and heifers, and calving area hygiene. Postmilking teat disinfection in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and years of practicing dry cow therapy were positively associated with the incidence rate of clinical mastitis. Herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and in which postmilking teat disinfection was not used had lower incidence rates of clinical mastitis than did other <b>herds.</b> The <b>incidence</b> rate of clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli was mostly related to housing conditions, hygiene, and machine milking. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was mostly related to factors associated with bulk milk somatic cell count and factors that {{might be due to}} cause and effect reversal. A strong positive correlation existed between the incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Staph. aureus. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae was related to nutrition, milking technique, and machine milking. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis was associated with factors related to housing, nutrition, and machine milking.

40|$|Peri-urban {{dairy cattle}} farms within 50 km of Bobo-Dioulasso were studied to assess <b>herd</b> type, disease <b>incidence,</b> management, feeding and {{breeding}} strategy. Out of 417 cattle farmers, 42 % had dairy objectives and were studied. Among these peri-urban dairy farmers, 60 % were settled, 36 % semi-settled, and 4 % transhumant. In total, they held 4558 dairy cows, of which 32 % lactated during the study. The prevalence of mastitis (55 %) increased (p 60 cattle) had advanced breeding strategies. Bulls and cows were culled at younger ages in herds with better breeding strategy. Overall, {{this resulted in}} higher individual milk offtake in small herds (2. 46 L/day) compared with large herds (1. 25 L/day). Pure breeds were rarely used, {{and the presence of}} Bos taurus baoule naturally selected for trypanotolerance was low. The prevalence of trypanosomosis (40 %) in herds dominated by Bos indicus zebu and Mere (Zebu x Baoule) is an argument for maintenance of biodiversity and selection of Baoule for milk production.

40|$|Repeat {{breeding}} (RB), {{defined as}} cows failure to conceive from 3 or more regularly spaced {{services in the}} absence of detectable abnormalities, is a costly problem for the dairy producer. To elucidate the occurrence of RB in Swedish dairy herds and to identify risk factors of the syndrome totally 57, 616 dairy cows in 1, 541 herds were investigated based on data from the official Swedish production-, AI- and disease- recording schemes. The characteristics of the RB syndrome were studied on both herd and individual cow level. The effects of risk factors on the herd frequency of RB were studied by logistic regression. A generalised linear mixed model with logit link, and accounting for herd-level variation by including a random effect of herd, was used to study the individual animal risk for RB. The total percentage of RB animals was 10. 1 % and the median proportion of RB animals in the herds studied was 7. 5 %. The proportion of RB cows in herds increased with decreased herd sizes with decreased average days from calving to first AI, with increased <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> of clinical mastitis, with decreased reproductive disorders, and increased other diseases treated by a veterinarian. On animal level, the risk factors were milk yield, lactation number, difficult calving or dystocia, season at first service, days in milk at first service and veterinary treatment for reproductive disorders before the first service. Cows being an RB animal in the previous lactation had a higher risk of becoming an RB animal also in the present lactation. In conclusion our results show that the repeat breeding syndrome is a multifactorial problem involving a number of extrinsic factors as well as intrinsic factors coupled to the individual animal. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Research in herd health {{management}} solely using a quantitative approach may present major {{challenges to the}} interpretation of the results, because the humans involved may have responded to their observations based on previous experiences and own beliefs. This challenge can be met through increased awareness and dialogue between researchers and farmers or other stakeholders about the background for data collection related to management and changes in management. By integrating quantitative and qualitative research methods in a mixed methods research approach, the researchers will improve their understanding of this potential bias of the observed data and farms, which will enable them to obtain more useful results of quantitative analyses. Case description An example is used to illustrate the potentials of combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to herd health related data analyses. The example is based on two studies on bovine metritis. The first study was a quantitative observational study of risk factors for metritis in Danish dairy cows based on data from the Danish Cattle Database. The other study was a semi-structured interview study involving 20 practicing veterinarians with the aim to gain insight into veterinarians' decision making when collecting and processing data related to metritis. Discussion and Evaluation The relations between risk factors and metritis in the first project supported the findings in several other quantitative observational studies; however, the <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> risk was highly skewed. There may be simple practical reasons for this, e. g. underreporting and differences in the veterinarians' decision making. Additionally, the interviews in the second project identified several problems with correctness and validity of data regarding the occurrence of metritis because of differences regarding case definitions and thresholds for treatments between veterinarians. Conclusion Studies where associations between specific herd {{health management}} routines and disease outcome variables are drawn based purely on quantitative observational studies may benefit greatly by adding a qualitative perspective to the quantitative approach as illustrated and discussed in this article. The combined approach requires, besides skills and interdisciplinary collaboration, also openness, reflection and scepticism from the involved scientists, but the benefits may be extended to various contexts both in advisory service and science. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although most of {{the genetic}} {{progress}} in production efficiency is achieved through selection at a global scale, locally, farm managers can also influence the selection process to better match genotypes and their varying herd environment. This study focused {{on the influence of}} a particular management decision-the use of extended lactation (EL) in dairy goat production systems- as it affects the survival and reproduction rates at the herd level, which may then shape different long-term selection responses. The objective was to understand and quantify the influences of EL and variability in achieved intake level on the responses to selection for production, reproduction, and longevity. An animal model of resource allocation between life functions was applied to the dairy goat. It predicts the trajectory of change in the herd genetic composition as affected by the feeding level and the selection pressure applied by the manager. During 40 yr, goats were selected for milk yield, reproduction, and, with a different selection weight for age (W-AGE), for longevity. Under varying achieved intake levels, increasing W-AGE improved the survival rate but a nonlinear effect was observed for the average milk yield and BCS. When moderately increasing W-AGE from 0, resources were reallocated from lactation towards body reserves and survival, which led to a trade-off at the herd level between improving survival and BCS and increasing milk yield. When further increasing W-AGE, old females became systematically preferred regardless of their reproductive status and the proportion of EL in the herd increased. Females undergoing EL had reduced energetic costs of reproduction, which improved their probability of survival. Across generations, an increased <b>herd</b> <b>incidence</b> of EL led to a relaxation of the selection pressure on the resource allocation to body reserves, which is normally imposed by the manager's priority to achieve successful reproduction at each mating. As selection for longevity progressed, the incidence of high-producing females increased within the herd, driving a long-term trend in increased milk production. Thus, the use of EL as a management tool led to an alleviation of the trade-off between milk yield progress and survival improvement. Although the model simplifies the underlying physiology of nutrient allocation, it provides insights into how farm manager strategies can influence the development of genotype x environment interactions and promote herd robustness...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research {{was to examine the}} association of <b>herd</b> level disease <b>incidence</b> with the return over feed (ROF) (milk income minus feed cost) herd profit index offered through Canwest Dairy Herd Improvement. The lactational incidence risks (LIR) for displaced abomasum, retained placenta, clinical mastitis, milk fever, clinical ketosis, and lameness submitted by producers (n = 48) were similar to previous reports. However, there was no negative association of clinical disease LIR’s with ROF. Subclinical ketosis and subclinical mastitis cumulative incidence were determined during the early postpartum period by using a cow-side test for betahydroxybutyrate in milk and the California Mastitis Test, respectively. Subclinical mastitis was not associated with ROF. However, a unit increase in the cumulative incidence of subclinical ketosis was associated with a decrease of $ 0. 015 /cow/day in the ROF. The results highlight the economic significance that subclinical ketosis may have in Ontario dairy herds...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{diagnostic}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} was based on test results of 346 sera from pigs known to be infected and 139 sera from pigs known not to be infected. All sera were tested with a monospecific antigen (serotype 1) and a polyspecific antigen (serotypes 1 - 5). The sensitivity of the polyspecific antigen was approximately 85 % at serum dilution 1 : 2 and {{was significantly higher than}} the monospecific antigen at all serum dilution levels. The specificity of the two antigen preparations was not significantly different at any dilution and increased from approximately 78 % to 1 : 2 to 100 % at 1 : 128. When pigs from <b>herds</b> with unknown <b>incidence</b> of infection were studied, it was found that a high proportion seroconverted, presumably as a response to subclinical infection. However, the antibody titres waned rapidly. This indicated that seroreaction expresses current or recent infection. Thus, the complement fixation test provides a reliable means of diagnosing pleuropneumonia of pigs and might be useful as a tool to control this disease...|$|R
40|$|High dietary sulfur (S) in {{ruminants}} {{introduces a}} range of effects not seen in nonruminant animals. This thesis focuses on several new mechanisms through which S interacts with copper (Cu) and thiamine metabolism, and on more complex three way interactions of S-Cu-thiamine in ruminants. The present investigation comprises three field studies, one in vivo study, and one in vitro study. The field studies were conducted on Saskatchewan farms. These studies include investigations of: a) the effects of high sulfate in the drinking water on blood thiamine status, and b) nutritional aspects and selected biochemical parameters in <b>herds</b> with <b>incidence</b> of clinical problems associated with consumption of excess S in drinking water. Cattle exposed {{to high levels of}} S in drinking water had lower blood thiamine than those drinking water containing a low concentration of S. The occurrence of polioencephalomalacia (PEM) was documented in all of our field research. These studies also showed that Cu influences interactions between S and thiamine. Both Cu and thiamine depletion in the blood of cattle drinking water containing a high concentration of S can be corrected by dietary supplementation of Cu alone. Chronic effects of nutritional S toxicity were investigated using sheep as a model. This study confirmed the known effects of S on Cu metabolism. It was also observed that Cu influences the effect of S on thiamine metabolism, and that the interaction of S-Cu-thiamine occurs in the gastrointestinal tract as well as systemically. The in vivo study also showed that, in chronic nutritional S toxicity in ruminants, the target organ is the brain. The early, (subclinical) morphologic and metabolic lesions were evident as altered electrophysiological events along the auditory pathway. After prolonged exposure (three to eight weeks) several animals developed PEM. The incidence of PEM was attributed (...|$|R
