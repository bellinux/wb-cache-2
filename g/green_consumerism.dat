How can ecological complexities along with diverging ideologies and knowledge claims be translated to a plain, trustworthy, and categorical label? Is there a general mismatch between the production and the consumption side of green labels? Is it possible to achieve broad public reflection, debate and participation on various environmental themes through green labeling? Does green labeling offer pathways toward a greening and democratization of society? The authors base their analyses on case studies from different sectors within two different policy contexts: Sweden (as part of Europe) and the USA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined In media, policymaking and research, {{increasing}} {{attention is}} drawn to the phenomenon of ‘green political consumerism’, referring to consumerrelated practices {{that are based on}} concerns beyond the traditional criteria of product quality and price. Political consumerism is about expressing non-economic values, that is, values beyond the direct, economic self-interest of consumers. Such values may concern social conditions of farmers producing our food or the welfare of animals used in food production. <b>Green</b> political <b>consumerism</b> is a concept that highlights a concern for environmental conditions, although these concerns often overlap with social and animal-related ones (Boström & Klintman 2008). Micheletti (2003) has defi ned political consumerism as consumers’ ‘individualistic collective action’, practiced, for instance, through boycotting or buycotting certain products and services. For the purpose of this chapter, it is important to mention {{that there is a need}} to keep the defi nition of political consumerism subject to continuous discussion and debate. A main claim in this chapter is that it is particularly important not to equal green political consumption merely with purchases of eco-labeled products and services. To follow such principles of consumption or to have small ecological footprints due to smaller economic resources, for example, are two very diff erent things, which should both be of interest in debates about political consumerism...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{try to figure}} out how capital logic caused {{ecological}} crises since capitalism developed. Furthermore I attempt to explore the relationship of capital logic and socialist countries. China, being a socialist country, is seriously bothered by ecological crises. I argued wether plan economy or market economy, when the government is deeply influenced by the lure of rapid economy growth, capital logic would dominate society, and ecological crises are inevitable. It is time for China to begin to implement controls on the market to improve ecological outcomes and rethink the concept of socialism. I conclude that ecological crises can be resolved, depending on whether China can move on from its traditional misunderstanding of socialism and make socialism redress the failure of the market. I make some suggestions, including <b>Green</b> GDP, restricted <b>consumerism</b> and narrowing the income gap. These may help to solve the current environmental crisis. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the empirical evidence that firms abate their pollution {{in response to}} <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> facilitated by dissemination of information through toxic release inventories. Lacking direct observational data {{on the extent of}} <b>green</b> <b>consumerism,</b> we construct an indirect method to elicit its effect on pollution abatement. Assuming that environmentally-motivated consumers cannot attribute pollution to individual goods produced by a multi-product firm, but rather reduce their demand across all product lines of the firm, we identify <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> through intra-firm inter-plant spillover effects in pollution abatement. We anticipate that such “environmentally-leveraged ” companies will reduce emissions by more than non-leveraged companies when they are exposed to consumer markets. We test predictions from a simple partial-equilibrium model with 1993 - 99 panel data from Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) in conjunction with related census data.

40|$|One of {{the drivers}} of <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> are social network {{externalities}} {{that are associated with}} buying 'green' because <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> is fashionable, or because of reputation effects. We analyze how the strength of this social network effect impacts <b>green</b> <b>consumerism,</b> environmental externalities and total welfare. We discuss a model where products are differentiated according to their environmental quality, where the production of green products generates positive externalities to all, and where those consumers purchasing a green product variety receive the additional benefits of {{being a member of the}} network of green consumers. Depending on the strength of the social network effect, we show that (a) firms may produce lower quality, (b) the market may generate fewer positive environmental externalities, and (c) total welfare may deteriorate. The main policy implication is that if there is a network effect, regulators should choose a stricter minimum environmental quality standard...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> {{and how it}} is used {{within the}} current {{practices}} of corporate and governmental agenda.

Through an analysis of international environmental organizations, as well as contemporary cases of <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> it is argued that many environmental concerns are themselves becoming commodified due to the inherent and deep seated role consumerism has in Western culture.

40|$|Trustworthy {{eco-labels}} provide {{consumers with}} valuable information on environmentally friendly products and thus promote <b>green</b> <b>consumerism.</b> But what makes an eco-label trustworthy {{and what can}} government do to increase consumer confidence? The scant existing literature indicates that low governmental involvement increases confidence. This suggests that government should just provide the basic legal framework for eco-labeling and leave the rest to non-governmental organizations. However, the empirical underpinning of this conclusion is insufficient. This paper analyses consumer confidence in different organic food labeling regimes {{with varying degrees of}} governmental involvement. Using unique and detailed survey data from USA, United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, the analysis shows that confidence is highest in countries with substantial state involvement. This suggests that governments can increase <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> through active and substantial involvement in eco-labeling...|$|E
40|$|This article revisits {{the widely}} {{believed}} {{notion of the}} skeptical green consumer, in other words, that green consumers tend to distrust green advertising. Study 1, a survey of U.

However, <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> was negatively related to green advertising skepticism. Study 2, a survey of Austrian consumers, addressed the underlying mechanism of this negative relationship in a mediation analysis. It was shown that green consumers saw more informational utility in green ads than nongreen consumers did. This, in turn, decreased their green advertising skepticism. The emotional appeal of green ads, however, had no impact on green advertising skepticism. Findings suggest that the "dilemma for marketers who desire to target the green consumer" (Zinkhan and Carlson 1995, p. 5) is far less serious than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|There is {{much debate}} {{about the value of}} "green consumerism. " Critics claim that {{environmentally}} conscientious shopping has negligible effects, does not address wider issues relating to the creation of needs and capitalism, and has been co-opted by advertisers as a marketing technique.

The focus {{of this paper is to}} outline these positions while examining the merits and shortcomings of <b>green</b> <b>consumerism.</b> Although this phenomenon does not necessarily question the "assumption of consumption, " it does provide a space for environmental activism for individuals who may not wish to participate in deeper ecological activities. <b>Green</b> <b>consumerism</b> would be aided by government intervention in the form of a regulatory body that would guarantee that "green " products have met strict environmental standards...|$|E

If so, this would contradict conventional wisdom that environmental expenditures reduce competitiveness and that increased levels of foreign direct investment or export-orientation in manufacturing will necessarily pre-empt firms from behaving in a "greener" fashion.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on eco-labeling and <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> has been framed within a classical market context where price and quality are the drivers of consumer choice. However, it seems possible {{that consumers are}} {{also concerned about the}} choices made by other consumers. In fact, it is unclear that people's consumption decisions are made independently of social context. For instance, under the desire to conform to certain social norms-or in the presence of status concerns-some individuals may be willing to pay a higher price premium for green products the more widespread <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> is in society. We test this hypothesis using a choice experiment where the respondents were asked to choose among coffee products varying with respect to their share of ecological beans, share of fair trade beans, and price. Three treatments were used, differing only in the information given about the choices made by other consumers. We find different responses to the treatments across individuals and we can only confirm our hypothesis of conformity for women, although men appear to have stronger preferences for ecological coffee than women have...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{concern about the}} {{environment}} has become not only a significant public issue but also a crucial topic in academic research. Concern about environmental sustainability and climate change has increased dramatically {{in the past and}} is affecting the way consumers behave. This change has lead to a greater focus on <b>green</b> <b>consumerism.</b> No doubt that environment is essential for the growth and survival of all living beings. But unfortunately environment has fallen prey for mankind. Nature is being degraded by the activities undertaken by companies. Hence, it becomes the responsibility of the business world to compensate for the harm that the companies are causing to environment. The growing social concern for the environment has recently emerged as a key issue in marketing. In recent years, this fact has leads to an increased interest by consumers in making environmentally social purchases. Recently, <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> has started to gradually emerge in the Asian region. With the interest in <b>green</b> <b>consumerism,</b> Asian consumers have recently become one of the primary targets for international marketers. Research has shown that consumers have translated their resulting environmental concern into actively purchasing green products. This study describes the profile of green product buyers in Malaysia. By using mall intercept survey, data were collected from consumers who do shopping at hypermarkets in Malaysia. From the analysis undertaken, it was found that level of green purchase behavior among Malaysian consumers is not encouraging. In this study, green purchase behavior tends to be differ across different gender where females tend to be greener than males. Green buyers do not differ across different level of household income and the green buyers are composed of married respondents.

In this context, “ecological motivation ” is a strategic issue of increased importance for the profitability of reverse supply chains due to companies ’ concerns about their “green image ” and environmental legislation. In this paper we examine the impact of the ecological motivation on the long term behavior of a simple system that can be encountered on a variety of real-world cases, namely that of a single producer and a single product chain with recycling activities. Ecological motivation manifests through a variety of issues that are investigated, including the take-back obligations, lower limits of recycling imposed by legislation, <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> and design for environment (DfE). We develop a novel modeling approach that captures these issues comprehensively by exploiting the principles of the system dynamics (SD) theory. The dynamic model provides a simulation tool, which can be used for the conduct of various “what-if ” analyses, by evaluating the impact of various regulatory measures and <b>green</b> <b>consumerism</b> on system performance.

40|$|Green Marketing {{has become}} an {{important}} strategy in businesses since the international rise of environmental awareness among countries. With greater awareness rising among the public, especially {{with reference to the}} global warming and climate change phenomenon, people have become cautious with regards to their purchases, specifically towards the nature of purchased products. As green marketing continues therefore to evolve not only into a strategy but into a platform across the world, Ghana is still at the onset of a green marketing phenomenon. To therefore assess the direction of this phenomenon, the study is aimed at determining the green marketing potential in Ghana as assessed through the perspective of consumers. Environmental Awareness and Consumer Behavior was used in order to assess the presence of a green potential in Ghana. As environmental awareness is able to serve a clear purpose for <b>green</b> <b>consumerism,</b> consumer behavior is able to show the applicative potential of <b>green</b> <b>consumerism.</b> Through online surveys and questionnaires, results of the study were able to reveal a strong green potential existing in Ghana, both with positive indicators within environmental awareness and consumer behavior.
