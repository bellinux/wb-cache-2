40|$|OF UNEMPLOYMENT <b>INSURANCE</b> <b>BENEFIT</b> ADEQUACY Traditionally {{studies of}} {{unemployment}} <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> adequacy {{have relied on}} an expenditure survey. This is expensive, yields small samples, and presumes that the analyst knows which categories of expenditure are necessary. This paper uses an existing large data set, and an agnostic approach. Labor supply are equations are estimated on PSID data using an estimator which accounts for rationing in the labor market. The results are used to compute labor market constraint compensation for comparison to payments under UI systems of representative states. The results suggest that payments which meet the accepted standard of adequacy would usually slightly overcompensate individuals. ...|$|R

25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit</b> of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not vest in his estate. The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or <b>insurance</b> <b>benefit,</b> ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate.|$|R

Additionally, most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is {{largely responsible for the}} rise in health care spending.|$|E
