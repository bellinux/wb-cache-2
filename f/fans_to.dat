40|$|Recent aero-acoustic {{tests of}} model coannular nozzles {{have shown that}} less noise is {{generated}} if the higher-velocity jet is exhausted from the outer annular passage {{rather than from the}} primary nozzle. These findings are of particular significance to a duct-burning turbofan (DBTF) engine being studied for application to an advanced supersonic transport. Unlike conventional turbofan engines that have peak velocities from the primary nozzle, it is possible to design a DBTF engine <b>to</b> have a <b>fan</b> velocity higher than that of the primary flow. Results are presented for a NASA-sponsored model test program that covers a range of <b>fan</b> <b>to</b> primary-area ratios from 0. 75 to 1. 2, and a range of <b>fan</b> <b>to</b> primary-velocity ratios from 0. 4 to 2. 8. Correlations are given that relate radiated sound power <b>to</b> <b>fan</b> velocity, <b>fan</b> <b>to</b> primary-velocity ratio, and <b>fan</b> <b>to</b> primary-area ratio. Corresponding exhaust-plume velocity-traverse data are presented which suggest that the observed noise benefits {{may be due to the}} more rapid decay of the annular flow because of shear stresses on the inner surface that result from the lower-velocity primary flow...|$|R
