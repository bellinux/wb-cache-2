5|$|Planning {{started in}} 1937, despite there being no legal powers that {{permitted}} motorway construction until {{the introduction of}} the Special Roads Act 1949. Early work was hampered by heavy rainfall, resulting in postponement of various <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> works such as the base foundation; the result of the weather meant the original two-year plan was delayed by a further five months. Weeks after opening, the road had to temporarily close due to water causing further problems, when the base layer was damaged {{as a result of a}} rapid freeze and thaw cycle.|$|E
5|$|As in World War I, Scapa Flow in Orkney {{served as}} an {{important}} Royal Navy base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and Rosyth gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the Firth of Forth and East Lothian. The shipyards and <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> factories in Glasgow and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the Luftwaffe, enduring great destruction and loss of life. As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part {{in the battle of}} the North Atlantic. Shetland's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the Shetland Bus by which fishing boats helped Norwegians fled the Nazis, and expeditions across the North Sea to assist resistance. Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when Rudolf Hess flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the Duke of Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{period for}} construction was {{planned to be}} around two years, but the timescale was lengthened by nearly 25% due to rainfall that persisted {{throughout much of the}} early construction period. The heavy rainfall in late 1956 had profound effects on the <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> works required to construct the road foundation, resulting in this aspect of work being postponed until early 1957; an extension of five months was granted due to the extraordinary and unforeseen weather conditions. Numerous lessons were learnt from the construction of Britain's first motorway, particularly towards using an appropriately screened base material, with water drainage systems that should be appropriate and fit for purposes, as well as the inclusion of continuous hard shoulders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe study {{considered}} {{issues for}} improving the efficiency of machining materials used in <b>heavy</b> power <b>engineering</b> {{on the basis of}} the development of carbide tools with nanostructured multilayer coatings (NMCC) of high wear resistance. The following compositions of the NMCC were developed for investigation: Ti-TiN-(TiCrAl) N; Zr-ZrN-(ZrNbCrAl) N; Cr-CrAlN-(NbZrCrAl) N; Zr-ZrN-(ZrCrAl) N. Wide-ranging studies of various properties and characteristics of elaborated NMCC, as well as contact parameters of cutting and wear mechanisms for the carbide tools with various compositions of NMCC are used in high-efficiency longitudinal turning material of <b>heavy</b> power mechanical <b>engineering.</b> Received results of research in this study allow establishing a rational coating composition for deposition on carbide tools providing increase of machining efficiency of the materials used in <b>heavy</b> power <b>engineering...</b>|$|R

50|$|By contrast, the Lithgow Zig Zag railway, built between 1866 and 1869, {{required}} much <b>heavier</b> <b>engineering,</b> {{including four}} large rock cuttings, three fine stone viaducts with 30 ft semi-circular arches (originally four were planned, but one was built as an embankment instead) {{and a short}} tunnel (three tunnels were planned, but two were daylighted during construction due to leaks, becoming {{two of the four}} cuttings mentioned above). In the descent of the middle road, the line dropped 101 ft between the reversing points, being part of the 550 ft descent from Clarence. The whole route had a ruling grade of 1:42 (~2.38%).|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{construction}} contract was let to Taylor R Stephenson {{who was a}} railway contractor. His civil engineer for the project was George Heald. In 1858 Heald died of tuberculosis at Rugeley; the person who reported the death was T.R. Stephenson. Losing the engineer for the project and with the line incomplete, Thomas Brassey was engaged to complete it. Thomas Brassey and George Heald had worked together many times before, notably on the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and the Caledonian Railway. The <b>heaviest</b> <b>engineering</b> work on the Cannock Mineral Railway was at Rugeley where a stone viaduct was built over the River Trent and a long embankment constructed across the Trent Meadows.|$|R
50|$|West Yorkshire grew {{up around}} several industries. Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield were grown through the {{development}} of woollen mills, Leeds' traditional industry was the manufacturing of cloth, while <b>heavier</b> <b>engineering</b> industries facilitated growth in South Leeds. Wakefield, Castleford, Pontefract and South and East Leeds were traditional coal mining areas. The woollen and cloth industries declined throughout the twentieth century. Many of the coal mines in West Yorkshire closed during the Robens era in the 1960s, but mining was still a significant employer in the Wakefield district {{at the time of the}} 1984-5 strike. The last pit in West Yorkshire to close was Hay Royds Colliery at Denby Dale in 2012 after a flood.|$|R
25|$|Alsthom {{was founded}} in 1928 from the merger of French <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> {{interests}} of the Thomson-Houston Electric Company (then part of General Electric) – the Compagnie française pour l'exploitation des procédés Thomson Houston (or Compagnie Française Thomson Houston, CFTH) and Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques, with the first factory in Belfort. In 1932, Alsthom expanded into transportation by acquiring Constructions Electriques de France, Tarbes, a manufacturer of electric locomotives as well as electrical and hydraulic equipment.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{employment}} in the Northern Irish economy was highly segregated in favour of Protestants, particularly at senior levels of the public sector, in certain then important sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering,</b> and strategically important {{areas such as the}} police. Emigration to seek employment was therefore significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Rolls-Royce {{acquired}} Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), a {{group of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> companies mainly associated with electrical generation and power management, based in the North East of England. The group included Clarke Chapman (cranes), Reyrolle (now part of Siemens) and Parsons (now part of Siemens steam turbines). The company was renamed Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. It was sold off piecemeal {{over the next decade}} as the company re-focused on its core aero-engine operations following the recession of the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{relatively}} easy with little requirement for <b>heavy</b> civil <b>engineering</b> works; however {{much of the}} subscribed capital was not forthcoming when the calls were made, the lack of cash severely slowed construction, many shares were forfeit, and the directors resorted to unauthorised borrowing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} growing {{demand in the}} Middle East for large power-generating {{facilities}} distracted the company from its push into North America. Oil-rich African nations, like Nigeria, attempting to diversify their manufacturing capabilities also created new markets for Brown Boveri's <b>heavy</b> electrical <b>engineering</b> expertise.|$|R

25|$|Operation Impact is {{the name}} of Canada's {{contribution}} to the military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant that began in September 2014. The first Canadian airstrike against an Islamic State target occurred on 2 November. It was reported that CF-18s successfully destroyed <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> equipment used to divert the Euphrates River near the city of Fallujah. In October, then Prime Minister designate Justin Trudeau informed President Barack Obama that Canada intended to withdraw its fighter aircraft, while keeping its ground forces in Iraq and Syria.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Quarry line, the bottle-neck on the heavily used main line moved further south. Plans were drawn up for the quadrupling throughout, but only the 16 miles from Earlswood to Three Bridges were completed, between 1906 and 1909. A fifth track was laid between Norwood Junction and South Croydon in 1907/8. Extension beyond Three Bridges would have involved <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering</b> at Balcombe tunnel, over the Ouse Valley Viaduct and through the South Downs. The required capital expenditure was diverted to extending the electrification programme.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Belfast became Ireland's {{pre-eminent}} {{industrial city}} with linen, <b>heavy</b> <b>engineering,</b> tobacco and shipbuilding dominating the economy. Belfast, {{located at the}} western end of Belfast Lough and {{at the mouth of the}} River Lagan, was an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry, which was dominated by the Harland and Wolff company which alone employed up to 35,000 workers and was one of the largest shipbuilders in the world. The ill-fated RMS Titanic was built there in 1911. Migrants to Belfast came from across Ireland, Scotland and England, but particularly from rural Ulster, where sectarian tensions ran deep. The same period saw the first outbreaks of sectarian riots, which have recurred regularly since.|$|E
