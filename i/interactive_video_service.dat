40|$|Low {{delay is}} {{critically}} important for <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> communication. Unpredictable delays and bursty traffic in today’s networks may significantly degrade the performance of <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis presents several predictive decoding techniques for delay reduction. The basic idea is to predict future video frames from past video data, and display them before they arrive at the decoder. Inevitably, this will reduce {{the quality of the}} displayed frames somewhat, but it will also enable the user to choose the proper trade-off between quality and delay. The frame prediction module was implemented as an add-on to MPEG- 4 video decoder, and tested on a variety of standard sequences. The performance highly depends on the characteristics of the sequence, such as motion intensity, frame rate, etc. Our results indicate that in most cases, it is possible to reduce the perceived end-to-end communication delay by about 100 ms while maintaining reasonable video quality...|$|R

This abstraction addresses specifically the need to obtain simultaneously high spectral efficiency, good subjective quality, and low perceptual delay on a wireless channel.

40|$|Interactive video {{systems will}} {{form the basis}} of a vast range of new {{telecommunications}} services set to emerge in the coming years. Interactive video services enable the user to select and control the playback of video objects located on a remote server, in real-time. Telecommunications, storage and compression technologies are maturing and converging rapidly to make interactive video achievable in the wide area. These interactive video services will transform information and entertainment systems in a fundamental way, the true impact of which is difficult to predict. This thesis presents a unified treatment of some of the issues related to <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> provision. Currently, there is much research being conducted on various aspects of these systems. The complex nature of large-scale interactive video systems has, however, often lead to the use of significant simplifying assumptions or isolated treatments of specific sub-problems. While these efforts are valuable, this thesis takes a more holistic approach. A top-down approach is used to perform a cost comparison of an entire network architecture, before considering various aspects of the system in more detail. As a result of an extensive literature survey and preliminary investigations, several areas are isolated for further consideration. Specifically, the use of disk-array based storage for video servers is considered in detail. Performability analysis is employed to compare various disk-array architectures from a combined performance and reliability perspective. Further, a new packing scheme is introduced for allocating video objects to the various disk arrays within a server. This scheme is shown to give considerable efficiency improvements over existing packing heuristics. Before transmission of video can commence, a video server must ensure that sufficient resources are available to support the call. Traditional call-admission control (CAC) procedures are shown to lead to high delay variability due to poor load balance. A new CAC scheme is proposed which utilises significant information about server state to improve load balance and reduce delay variability. The thesis concludes with a methodology suitable for designing large-scale interactive video systems suitable for supporting video-on- demand style applications. The method applies the analytic tools presented earlier in the dissertation to provide the engineer with a robust method for top-down system design. The results of this thesis lead to the conclusion that interactive video systems can be constructed cost-effectively utilising existing storage and networking technologies. The costs are, however, substantial and a high level of market penetration will be required to ensure that such systems are profitable in the medium-term...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{culmination}} and {{convergence of}} several different technologies, including video compression and networking, are today making possible the design (and soon the deployment) of commercial <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> Several commercial trials have been announced, are in progress, or are already completed. The multi-disciplinary nature of video-on-demand services, which includes content providers, service providers, network providers, cable TV distribution companies, {{as well as}} the computing and consumer electronics industries, has made it extremely difficult to concentrate within a single organization the expertise needed to design and implement such services. Attesting to that is the significant activity that has been created within the industry in terms of alliances and partnerships. As with any prospective service of such anticipated scale, it is imperative to ensure that open and interoperable systems are used. This not only alleviates the problem of having t...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for the performance characterization of short-range communications systems is developed {{with the intention of}} investigating the feasibility of new multimedia wireless services at millimeter waves (MMWs). Both narrow- and wide-band systems are considered for mobile and/or fixed users. This paper aims at defining and evaluating proper metrics to characterize the service quality for the user and jointly takes the propagation characteristics, the transmission techniques, and the multiple access protocols into account. The definition of service-oriented metrics is emphasized. Three different real scenarios operating at MMW are investigated with a unified perspective: intelligent transport systems, wide-band local-area networks, and local multipoint distribution systems for <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> The role played by the MMW band in the development of these services is discussed. In each scenario, accurate propagation analysis is carried out and suitable countermeasure techniques are pointed out in order to join suitable service-quality levels.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} scheme called Type-Aware Error Control (TAEC) to provide robust <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services</b> over {{time-varying}} wireless channels. Basically, TAEC explores the temporal dependence of video frames by pushing out the lower impact frames. In doing so, queuing delay is controlled {{and the important}} frame is retransmitted multiple times. We consider {{the application of the}} nonstationary stochastic control to further improve the wireless system throughput by exploring the multiuser diversity gain. The techniques involved in our proposed solution consist of constructing a Markov model, reducing the number of parameters estimated, and avoiding the state explosion problem. The provisioning of immediate bandwidth guarantee is another feature of TAEC, i. e., when exploring the multiuser diversity gain, the users share their reserved bandwidth only if the perceived video qualities are acceptable. As shown in the simulation, TAEC improves the perceived video quality in terms of luminance PSNR when compared to other schemes.

30|$|Audiovisual {{telecommunication}} <b>services</b> like <b>video</b> {{on demand}} (VoD), Internet protocol television (IPTV), mobile television (MoTV), and videotelephony became broadly used multimedia {{services in the}} past two decades. In order to ensure a high level of user satisfaction, it is required to efficiently assess the quality of experience (QoE) with regard to the quality of service (QoS) through the variety of audiovisual services. The present study focuses on <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services</b> like videotelephony and proposes to evaluate the audiovisual quality as subjectively perceived by the user. Perceived audiovisual quality stems from the cognitive processing of multi-sensory stimuli like the auditory and visual ones. In order to predict the quality of the perceived auditory and visual signals, instrumental models were developed. They are categorized depending on their inputs: parameter-based models use parameters from the application and the network layers; media-based models perform a quality analysis on the physical characteristics of the transmitted signal itself. Finally, hybrid models constitute a mixture of the media-based and bitstream-based models. For further information on {{the current state of the}} art on audio and video quality metrics, one can refer to exhaustive surveys on that particular topic [1 – 3]. The aforementioned models were developed in a passive paradigm and assume a single modality (audio or video).|$|R

40|$|Statistical Bit Rate (SBR) ATM {{capability}} {{is considered a}} good option for supporting Variable Bit Rate (VBR) services. However, its study is somewhat in lag compared with Deterministic Bit Rate (DBR) or Available Bit Rate (ABR) capabilities. The de nition of a general Call Acceptance Control (CAC) function is di cult to state for SBR. We present some results regarding the multiplexing of real time data streams, mainly from <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>services,</b> which are naturally VBR and therefore candidates to use the SBR capability. It is shown that image quality is improved by using SBR instead of DBR. The coder design does not become more complicated. In fact, it remains the same. We propose a statistical model for the tra c generated by such video sources. The delays introduced by a switch are studied following two approaches. Exact bounds are found for a worst case situation, indicating a very low statistical gain. However, simulations show that these bounds are too pessimistic since the worst case very rarely occurs. A very high mean load can be reached with acceptable delays. Indeed, the statistical gain {{is found to be}} signi cant. The CAC for this kind of service may be simple because, even assuming pessimistic gures, the burstiness for a real-time video data stream appears to be low. Eje: Procesamiento distribuido y paralelo.

For the proposed VA-PRTS, this paper defines a cutoff visual attention metric algorithm to determine the quality of the encoded video slice based on the capability of visual attention and the progressive streaming method based on the priority of RoI video data. Compared to conventional methods, VA-PRTS increases the bitrate saving by over 57 % and decreases the interactive delay by over 66 %, while maintaining a level of perceptual video quality.

A proxy retrieves a block from a server, deposits it in its local cache buffer, and provides a requesting client with the block in time. It maintains the cache with limited capacity by replacing unnec-essary cached blocks with a newly retrieved block. The proxy cache server also prefetches video blocks that are expected to be required in the near future in order to avoid cache misses. In addition, the quality of cached video data can be adapted appropriately in the proxy to cope with the client-to-client heterogeneity, in terms of the available bandwidth, end-system performance, and user preferences on the perceived video quality.
