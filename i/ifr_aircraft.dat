25|$|In 1997, the Diamond DA40 a four-place <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{received}} certification; it {{was followed}} by the twin diesel engine DA42 in 2004. According to Flight International, the DA40 was capable of outperforming many similar aircraft which at that time had carried substantially greater purchase costs than the DA40 outfitted with a basic configuration. When launched in 2001, the DA40TDI would be the production aircraft powered by a single diesel-based piston engine.|$|E
50|$|GNSS {{systems have}} a lower {{transmitter}} cost per customer and provide distance and altitude data. Future satellite navigation systems, such as the European Union Galileo, and GPS augmentation systems are developing techniques to eventually equal or exceed VOR accuracy. However, low VOR receiver cost, broad installed base and commonality of receiver equipment with ILS are likely to extend VOR dominance in aircraft until space receiver cost falls to a comparable level. As of 2008 in the United States, GPS-based approaches outnumbered VOR-based approaches but VOR-equipped <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> outnumber GPS-equipped <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As of the 3rd of June 2010, all GAAP {{aerodromes}} {{were changed}} to Class D aerodromes, {{and the previous}} Class D procedures were changed. The new Class D procedures {{are similar to the}} FAA Class D procedures. VFR Aircraft are no longer required to enter the airspace via set inbound/outbound points, however can be directed there by ATC. VFR and <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> now require taxi clearance in the [...] "manoeuvring area" [...] of the aerodrome, but can still taxi within set apron areas without a clearance. <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> now receive slot times and the visibility requirements of Special VFR are reduced from 3000m Visibility to 1600m.|$|E
50|$|Class A: All {{operations}} must {{be conducted}} under <b>IFR.</b> All <b>aircraft</b> {{are subject to}} ATC clearance. All flights are separated from each other by ATC.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{need not}} necessarily be equipped for flight under <b>IFR,</b> and the <b>aircraft</b> must remain clear of clouds with the surface in sight, and maintain a certain flight visibility minimum (1,500 metres according to ICAO, one statute mile in the US, 1,500 m visibility, in sight of surface and clear of cloud in Europe). The pilot continues {{to be responsible for}} obstacle and terrain clearance.|$|R
5000|$|For {{efficiency}} of operations, some ATC operations will routinely provide [...] "pop-up" [...] <b>IFR</b> clearances for <b>aircraft</b> operating VFR, but that are arriving {{at an airport}} that does not meet VMC requirements. For example, in the United States, California's Oakland (KOAK), Monterey (KMRY) and Santa Ana (KSNA) airports routinely grant temporary IFR clearance when a low coastal overcast forces instrument approaches, {{while the rest of}} the state is still under visual flight rules.|$|R
5000|$|Australia {{used to have}} a {{non-standard}} {{class of}} airspace for use at the capital city general aviation airports, called a General Aviation Airport Procedures Zone (GAAP Zone). A control tower provided procedural clearances for all aircraft inside the zone. Additionally, any aircraft operating within [...] of the zone must obtain a clearance. VFR aircraft arrive and depart using standard arrival and departure routes, while instrument arrival and departure procedures are published for IFR operations. During visual meteorological conditions (VMC), <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> are not provided with full IFR services. During instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), or marginal VMC, VFR operations are restricted in order to facilitate full IFR service for <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Specific {{procedures}} allow <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{to transition}} safely through {{every stage of}} flight. These procedures specify how an IFR pilot should respond, even {{in the event of}} a complete radio failure, and loss of communications with ATC, including the expected aircraft course and altitude.|$|E
50|$|Airspace {{exists in}} seven classes, A to G, in {{decreasing}} order of {{air traffic control}} regulation. There is no F class in North America. Classes A to E are controlled airspace and class G is uncontrolled airspace. At {{one end of the}} scale in classes A and B airspace, all aircraft must be separated from each other. At {{the other end of the}} scale in class G airspace there is no requirement for any aircraft to be separated from each other. In the intermediate classes some aircraft are separated from each other depending on the flight rules under which the aircraft are operating. For example, in class D airspace, <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> are separated from other <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but not from VFR aircraft, nor are VFR aircraft separated from each other.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 1989, Skylink Airlines Flight 070, a Fairchild Metro III {{was on a}} {{scheduled}} flight from Vancouver(YVR) to Terrace (YXT), British Columbia with two pilots and five passengers on board. The aircraft crashed one quarter mile {{to the west of}} Terrace Airport while the crew was attempting to carry out a missed approach in <b>IFR</b> conditions. The <b>aircraft</b> was destroyed by the impact and a post-crash fire. All seven occupants were fatally injured in the crash.|$|R
5000|$|Class G: All {{remaining}} airspace, comprising by far {{the largest}} part of the airspace below FL 195. The UK is unusual in that it has not adopted a widespread class E system of airways for most airspace lower than FL 70. Therefore, for light <b>aircraft,</b> <b>IFR</b> flight in Class G airspace is relatively common. Use of a radio or transponder is not required, even in IMC. ATC units may provide an [...] "as far as practical" [...] form of separation between some such flights, but participation in the service is voluntary.|$|R
50|$|Non-towered {{airports}} may lie {{inside or}} underneath controlled airspace. In that case, {{some or all}} aircraft arriving and departing require clearances from a remote air traffic control unit, such as terminal or center control, {{even though there is}} no control tower managing landings and takeoffs. Pilots may be able to obtain those clearances by radio, by phone, or through a company dispatcher or local Flight Service Station; in some cases, departing <b>aircraft</b> (<b>IFR</b> or VFR) take off and level out below the floor of controlled airspace, then radio for a clearance before climbing further. Some countries establish low-altitude VFR corridors for non-towered airports in large urban areas so that VFR arrivals and departures can avoid controlled airspace altogether.|$|R
50|$|The Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center (or ZSE or Seattle Center or Seattle ARTCC) is {{the area}} control center {{responsible}} for controlling and ensuring proper separation of <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> in Washington state, most of Oregon, and parts of Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and California, {{as well as the}} neighboring area into the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|A STAR is an ATC-coded IFR arrival route {{established}} for application to arriving <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> destined for certain airports. Area navigation (RNAV) STAR/FMSP procedures for arrivals serve {{the same purpose}} but are used only by aircraft equipped with FMS or GPS. The purpose of both is to simplify clearance delivery procedures and facilitate transition between en route and instrument approach procedures.|$|E
5000|$|The show's {{progression}} usually {{started with}} a satellite and radar segment, followed by the current conditions around the U.S. (vice versa in early years), then the forecast (especially in terms of temperatures and precipitation), followed by an aviation forecast (locations of MVFR and <b>IFR,</b> <b>aircraft</b> icing, turbulence and winds aloft) and ended (when necessary) with an inclement weather report, called [...] "WeatherWatch".|$|E
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprises}} internal fuel tanks {{located in the}} wings and fuselage with a capacity of they are refuelled through a single point pressure refuelling system (see turbine fuel systems). Internal fuel storage can be supplemented by external fuel tanks. One [...] drop tank can be mounted on the aircraft's centerline hardpoint under the fuselage and two 800-litre or [...] drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints. The fuel system is compatible with in-flight refuelling (<b>IFR),</b> allowing tanker <b>aircraft</b> to refuel inflight, and increasing its range and loitering time significantly. All production aircraft for the PAF are to be fitted with IFR probes. In June 2013, PAF Air Chief Marshal Tahir Rafique Butt said ground tests on the JF-17's refuelling probes had been successfully completed and the first mid-air refuelling operations would commence that summer.|$|R

One 800 litre imp gal drop tank can be mounted on the aircraft's centerline hardpoint under the fuselage and two 800-litre or 1110 litre imp gal drop tanks can be mounted on the two inboard under-wing hardpoints.

40|$|Autonomous Flight Rules (AFR) are {{proposed}} {{as a new}} set of operating regulations in which aircraft navigate on tracks of their choice while self-separating from traffic and weather. AFR would exist alongside Instrument and Visual Flight Rules (IFR and VFR) as one of three available flight options for any appropriately trained and qualified operator with the necessary certified equipment. Historically, ground-based separation services evolved by necessity as aircraft began operating in the clouds and were unable to see each other. Today, technologies for global navigation, airborne surveillance, and onboard computing enable the functions of traffic conflict management to be fully integrated with navigation procedures onboard the aircraft. By self-separating, aircraft can operate with more flexibility and fewer restrictions than are required when using ground-based separation. The AFR concept is described in detail and provides practical means by which self-separating aircraft could share the same airspace as <b>IFR</b> and VFR <b>aircraft</b> without disrupting the ongoing processes of Air Traffic Control...|$|R

5000|$|Australia - Australia has full {{continental}} ADS-B coverage above FL300 (30,000 feet). ADS-B {{equipment is}} mandatory for all aircraft flying at this altitude. To achieve {{this level of}} coverage Airservices Australia operates more than 70 ADSB sites. In Australia the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority mandated a phased requirement for all Instrument Flight Rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>aircraft</b> to be equipped with ADS-B by 2 February 2017. This applies to all Australian aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Every runway used by <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{normally}} has {{a procedural}} approach defined and published. This generally involves the aircraft flying over a fix (navaid or 'beacon') on {{or close to}} the airport (where the aircraft can hold if necessary), flying away from the airport on a set track while descending (going 'beacon outbound'), then at some point (perhaps ten miles) from the airport turning back towards the airport aligned with the runway to make an approach (becoming 'inbound track established' or just 'established').|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason for}} abandoning the {{approach}} is unknown. Since the meteorological conditions were close to the minimum permitted for an <b>IFR</b> approach, the <b>aircraft</b> would need to approach close to the ECHO 1 approach trajectory. On the aircraft's improper approach, the investigation noted {{that there was a}} low probability that the aircraft could have stabilized its approach in order to land safely. With a wet runway and if the aircraft crossed the threshold at the reference speed, the aircraft would have a 385 m safety margin to land on the wet runway. There was a 2 kn tailwind {{at the time of the}} attempted landing. Additionally, a non-directional radio beacon (NDB) just before the runway (RR NBD) was non-functional on the day of the accident. Because the aircraft did not follow the ECHO 1 approach, it did not pass the only NBD available for determining the missed approach point, which was SAT NBD. The report concluded that [...] "the fact that the crew did not follow the profile of the ECHO 1 approach, along with their difficulty stabilizing the aircraft on a final approach, and the tail wind component condition may have contributed to their decision to discontinue the approach." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{operation}} of an aircraft under VFR is not safe, because the visual cues outside the aircraft are obscured by weather or darkness, instrument flight rules {{must be used}} instead. <b>IFR</b> permits an <b>aircraft</b> to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which is essentially any weather condition less than VMC but in which aircraft can still operate safely. Use of instrument flight rules are also required when flying in [...] "Class A" [...] airspace regardless of weather conditions. Class A airspace extends from 18,000 feet {{above mean sea level}} to flight level 600 (60,000 feet pressure altitude) above the contiguous 48 United States and overlying the waters within 12 miles thereof. Flight in Class A airspace requires pilots and aircraft to be instrument equipped and rated and to be operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In many countries commercial airliners and their pilots must operate under IFR as the majority of flights enter Class A airspace; however, aircraft operating as commercial airliners must operate under IFR even if the flight plan does not take the craft into Class A airspace, such as with smaller regional flights. Procedures and training are significantly more complex compared to VFR instruction, as a pilot must demonstrate competency in conducting an entire cross-country flight in IMC conditions, while controlling the aircraft solely by reference to instruments.|$|R
40|$|A flight {{simulator}} {{study has been}} carried out to evaluate the performance of modern flight control systems encountering curved wake vortices. During the decay process the shape of wake vortices alters significantly which has an influence on the encounter characteristics and thus on the encounter hazard. To analyse most realistic wake encounters, flow fields of matured vortices have been generated with large-eddy-simulations. These were used for the determination of induced force and moment histories during the encounter. The force and moment histories have been implemented into the equations of motions of a 6 DoF flight simulation. For the sake of comparison encounters have also been simulated with straight vortices as they were mostly used for many other investigations. The most important goal {{of the study was to}} analyse the difference between these ideally straight vortices and vortices with a more realistic shape regarding encounter acceptance. The simulator study was conducted in an A 330 motion-based full-{{flight simulator}} with pilots-in-the-loop. The analysed scenario was a wake encounter during final approach. The encounter conditions corresponded to a heavy-behind-heavy situation for Instrument Flight Rules (<b>IFR)</b> operations. The <b>aircraft</b> was flown either manually (in normal law) or with autopilot engaged. Altogether 93 encounters have been simulated, 38 with straight and 55 encounters with curved vortices. For encounters under manual control the simulator study revealed a potential risk of pilot induced oscillations (PIO) during encounters with curved vortices. With autopilot engaged not even one encounter with curved vortices was classified to be unacceptable. Although significant aircraft response was experienced the autopilot never disengaged automatically in any encounter. Altogether about 12 percent of the encounters were not accepted by the pilots. This is indeed a significant number, especially as the analysed scenarios can be regarded to be realistic situations which can occur in reality even if the applicable separation distances are applied. ...|$|R
50|$|Generally, VMC {{requires}} greater {{visibility and}} cloud clearance in controlled airspace than in uncontrolled airspace. In uncontrolled airspace {{there is less}} risk of a VFR aircraft colliding with an instrument flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>aircraft</b> emerging from a cloud, so aircraft are permitted to fly closer to clouds. An exception to this rule is class B airspace, in which ATC separates VFR traffic from all other traffic (VFR or IFR), which is why in class B airspace lower cloud clearance is permitted.|$|E
5000|$|The VFR {{pilot is}} {{required}} to [...] "see and avoid" [...] obstacles and other aircraft. Pilots flying under VFR assume responsibility for their separation from all other aircraft and are generally not assigned routes or altitudes by air traffic control (ATC). Depending on the category of airspace in which the flight is being conducted, VFR aircraft {{may be required to}} have a transponder to help Air Traffic Control identify the aircraft on radar in order that ATC can provide separation to <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Local Airport Advisory (LAA) {{service is}} {{provided}} within 10 statute miles of an airport where a Flight Service Station is located and a control tower is not operating. The FSS provides advisories regarding weather and known traffic to all participating aircraft within the area, in effect acting as an [...] "advisory" [...] tower which helps to coordinate traffic, {{but does not}} directly control it. At these airports Flight Service also serves the function of relaying ATC clearances to <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Participation by VFR aircraft is not required.|$|E
5000|$|En-route {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} work in facilities called air traffic control centers, {{each of which is}} commonly referred to as a [...] "center". The United States uses the equivalent term air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Each center is responsible for many thousands of square miles of airspace (known as a flight information region) and for the airports within that airspace. Centers control <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the time they depart from an airport or terminal area's airspace to the time they arrive at another airport or terminal area's airspace. Centers may also [...] "pick up" [...] VFR aircraft that are already airborne and integrate them into the IFR system. These aircraft must, however, remain VFR until the center provides a clearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} {{by which}} an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In controlled airspace, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) separates <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> from obstacles and other aircraft using a flight clearance based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on radar, or through aircraft position reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft position reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact. The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.|$|E
5000|$|German {{air traffic}} of today {{comprises}} between 1000 and 2000 aircraft tracks {{at the same}} time in the national airspace. Besides classical ATC radars also new types of sensors or position information sources like Multilateration, ADS-B, and others are to be integrated. Per day it is required to process up to 10000 flight plans. In the context of the discussion and development of transnational functional airspaces block like FABEC the required number of maintainable tracks will even grow beyond the 3000, possibly more than 5000 simultaneous tracks. An equivalent growth in needed flightplan handling capacity can be reasonably assumed. Each aircraft needs suitable Kalman filtering for tracking to cope both with steady flight and manoeuvre conditions in the different airspaces, and each <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> needs linkage processing to correlate flightplan data correctly to the track; simple code-callsign-pairing is insufficient due to multiple use of SSR codes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{holding pattern}} for {{instrument}} flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{is usually a}} racetrack pattern based on a holding fix. This fix can be a radio beacon such as a non-directional beacon (NDB) or VHF omnidirectional range (VOR). The fix {{is the start of}} the first turn of the racetrack pattern. Aircraft will fly towards the fix, and once there will enter a predefined racetrack pattern. A standard holding pattern uses right-hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180 degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). [...] Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected; longer legs (usually two or three minutes) may be used, or aircraft with distance measuring equipment (DME) may be assigned patterns with legs defined in nautical miles rather than minutes. Less frequent turns are more comfortable for passengers and crew. Additionally, left-hand turns may be assigned to some holding patterns if there are airspace or traffic restrictions nearby.|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} {{problems}} of defining and measuring the 'mental workload' of aircraft pilots and other human operators of complex dynamic systems. Of the alternative approaches the author indicates a clear preference {{for the use of}} subjective scaling. Some recent experiments from MIT and elsewhere are described which utilize subjective mental workload scales in conjunction with human decision and control tasks in the laboratory. Finally a new three-dimensional mental workload rating scale, under current development for use by <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> pilots, is presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a computer simulation of the NASA Autonomous Flight Rules (AFR) concept for airborne self-separation in airspace shared with conventional Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic. This study was designed to determine the impact of varying levels of intent information from <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the performance of AFR conflict detection and resolution. The study used Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) to supply IFR intent, but other methods such as an uplink from a ground-based System Wide Information Management (SWIM) network could alternatively supply this information. The independent variables of the study consist of the number of ADS-B trajectory change reports broadcast by <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> and the time interval between those reports. The conflict detection and resolution metrics include: the number of conflicts and losses of separation, the average conflict warning time, and {{the amount of time spent}} in strategic vs. tactical flight modes (i. e., whether the autoflight system was decoupled from the planned route in the Flight Management System in order to respond to a short-notice traffic conflict). The results show a measurable benefit of broadcasting IFR intent vs. relying on state-only broadcasts. The results of this study will inform ongoing separation assurance research and FAA NextGen design decisions for the sharing of trajectory intent information in the National Airspace System...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{developed}} a far-term air traffic management concept, termed Distributed Air/Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM). One component of DAG-TM, En Route Free Maneuvering, allows properly trained flight crews of equipped autonomous aircraft to assume responsibility for separation from other autonomous aircraft and from Instrument Flight Rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Ground-based air traffic controllers continue to separate IFR traffic and issue flow management constraints to all aircraft. To examine En Route Free Maneuvering operations, a joint human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted in summer 2004 at the NASA Ames and Langley Research Centers. Test subject pilots used desktop flight simulators to resolve traffic conflicts and adhere to air traffic flow constraints issued by subject controllers. The experimental airspace integrated both autonomous and <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> at varying traffic densities. This paper presents {{a subset of the}} En Route Free Maneuvering experimental results, focusing on airborne and ground-based conflict resolution, and the effects of increased traffic levels on the ability of pilots and air traffic controllers to perform this task. The results show that, in general, increases in autonomous traffic do not significantly impact conflict resolution performance. In addition, pilot acceptability of autonomous operations remains high throughout the range of traffic densities studied. Together with previously reported findings, these results continue to support the feasibility of the En Route Free Maneuvering component of DAG-TM...|$|E
40|$|This flimsy was {{developed}} to document the work being accomplished by the FAA to assess alternatives for providing PNT services when GNSS is not available due to RFI. Purpose This paper will summarize the scope and initial results of an alternative analysis being performed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Navigation Services Directorate to assess various Non-GNSS navigation system architectures to provide alternate positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) services for aviation users in the US National Airspace System (NAS) to mitigate for the vulnerability of GNSS to radio frequency interference (RFI). APNT Mission Statement According to U. S. National Policy, the FAA needs to provide an Alternative Positioning Navigation and Timing (APNT) service to maintain safety, and minimize economic impacts from GNSS interference outages within the national airspace system (NAS).

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{anticipated}} future demand for air travel, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is investigating a new concept of operations known as Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM). Under the En Route Free Maneuvering component of DAG-TM, appropriately equipped autonomous aircraft self separate from other autonomous aircraft and from managed aircraft that continue to fly under today s Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Controllers provide separation services between <b>IFR</b> <b>aircraft</b> and assign traffic flow management constraints to all aircraft. To address concept feasibility issues pertaining to integrated air/ground operations at various traffic levels, NASA Ames and Langley Research Centers conducted a joint human-in-the-loop experiment. Professional airline pilots and air traffic controllers flew a total of 16 scenarios under four conditions: mixed autonomous/managed operations at three traffic levels and a baseline all-managed condition at the lowest traffic level. These scenarios included en route flights and descents to a terminal area meter fix in airspace modeled after the Dallas Ft. Worth area. Pilots of autonomous aircraft met controller assigned meter fix constraints with high success. Separation violations by subject pilots did not appear to vary with traffic level and were mainly attributable to software errors and procedural lapses. Controller workload was lower for mixed flight conditions, even at higher traffic levels. Pilot workload was deemed acceptable under all conditions. Controllers raised several safety concerns, most of which pertained to the occurrence of near-term conflicts between autonomous and managed aircraft. These issues are being addressed through better compatibility between air and ground systems and refinements to air and ground procedures...|$|E
