Given that many OECD countries have to replace substantial portions of their electricity-generating capacity over the next 10 - 20 Â years, investment decisions today will determine the CO 2 -intensity of the future energy mix. But by what type of power plants will old (mostly <b>fossil-fuel-fired)</b> capacity be replaced? Given that modern, less carbon-intensive technologies are still expensive but can be expected to undergo improvements due to technical change in the near future, they may become more attractive, especially if fossil fuel price volatility makes traditional technologies more risky. At the same time, technological progress is an inherently uncertain process itself. In this paper, we use a real options model with stochastic technical change and stochastic fossil fuel prices in order to investigate their impact on replacement investment decisions in the electricity sector. We find that the uncertainty associated with the technological progress of renewable energy technologies leads to a postponement of investment. Even the simultaneous inclusion of stochastic fossil fuel prices in the same model does not make renewable energy competitive compared to <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> technology in the short run based on the data used. This implies that policymakers have to intervene if renewable energy is supposed to get diffused more quickly.

40|$|As {{the debate}} over the design of a federal {{greenhouse}} gas cap-and-trade program unfolds, the distribution (or allocation) of emission allowances {{will be one of the}} most difficult issues to resolve. The distributional implications of allocation decisions have long been appreciated. However, various proposals in Congress have made it increasingly clear that these decisions also could have a profound effect on how emissions are reduced under a cap-and-trade program, and could thereby have a substantial effect on the program's societal cost. This paper describes an important exception to the conventional wisdom that allocation decisions do not affect a cap-and-trade program's societal cost. While this wisdom holds for many types of allocations, it does not apply to conditional allocations in which the number of allowances that a firm receives is conditioned on the firm's future operational or investment decisions. To demonstrate this point, this paper examines an allocation provision in the draft of the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 that was reported out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in December 2007 (the Lieberman-Warner bill). This provision, Section 3902, would distribute allowances to new <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plants on the basis of their future output. In so doing, it would dramatically reduce, and in certain cases reverse, some of the most important emission reduction incentives that a cap-and-trade program would create. Section 3902 's new entrant provision would counteract the incentive that a cap-and-trade program otherwise would create for firms to shift some investments in new electric generating capacity toward non-emitting renewable or nuclear plants. The provision's effects would be so significant that, for several years, the Lieberman-Warner bill's cap-and-trade program would actually create incentives for firms to invest in low-emitting <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> plants instead of non-emitting renewable or nuclear plants. Section 3902 's new entrant provision also would reduce the marginal cost of generation from new <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> plants relative to existing plants. As a result of this provision, electricity generation from some existing plants would be economically displaced by generation from new plants even in cases where the new plants have higher emission rates and fuel costs. An examination of Section 3902 's effects highlights the need to carefully analyze the incentives that any conditional allocation provisions would create, regardless of whether those provisions are designed with the intention of creating particular incentives, or are instead designed to achieve certain distributional objectives. Otherwise, there is a real risk that much of the emission reduction measures achieved under a cap-and-trade program will be driven by allocation decisions made in the halls of Congress, rather than by the market-based incentives that a cap-and-trade program is intended to create. Such an outcome would invariably increase the cost of reducing U. S. greenhouse gas emissions. ...|$|E

The analysis shows production effect as the major factor responsible for rise in CO 2 emissions during the period 1990 - 2005. The generation structure effect also contributed in CO 2 emissions increase, although at a slower rate. In contrary, the energy intensity effect is responsible for modest reduction in CO 2 emissions during this period. Over the 2005 - 2030 period, production effect remains the key factor responsible for increase in emissions and energy intensity effect is responsible for decrease in emissions.

40|$|AbstractThe use {{of water}} is a {{critical}} aspect in the design, engineering and operation of any <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plant {{and it is an}} important element in any environmental assessment and life cycle analysis. A large amount {{of water is}} needed to generate electricity from any <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plant. This paper summarizes the results of a study carried out by Foster Wheeler for the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEA GHG) with the purpose of evaluating the water usage in plants with and without CO 2 capture. The study focuses on the techno-economic evaluation of five different alternatives establishing, for each of them, the water usage and the possibility of reducing the water consumption in areas where availability of water could be limited. The study evaluates several alternative bituminous-coal-fired power plant configurations based on the following technologies: •Pulverised coal-fired power plant with ultrasupercritical steam cycle (USC-PC);•Pulverised coal-fired power plant with ultrasupercritical steam cycle using oxyfuel combustion;•IGCC using GEE quench-type gasifier. All cases are evaluated without and with capture of the CO 2. The CO 2 capture rate is assumed to be at least 85 % of the total CO 2 emissions. In all cases the plant is located in an area where water supply could be severely limited and therefore special attention is paid to any possibility of reducing the water usage and consumption. Reference plants located in areas without water limitations, used as a basis for this study, are taken from reports already issued by IEA GHG R&D Programme, assessing the performance of power plants with and without CO 2 capture. Some of the reference reports have been developed by Foster Wheeler and some by other engineering companies. The following study objectives are pursued: •To establish a rigorous accounting of water usage throughout the different power plants and compare water usage in power plants with and without CO 2 capture, providing a breakdown of water consumption for each case. •To establish an acceptable methodology {{that can be used to}} compare water usage in power plants and provide a baseline set of cases and water loss data for assessing potential improvements and evaluating R&D programs. •To evaluate water usage and loss of power plants using oxyfuel, pre- or post combustion CO 2 capture technologies. •To assess and evaluate the performance, the costs and the potential impact on the water usage of power plants with CO 2 capture located in areas where water supply could be severely limited.

It is designed by combining up to seven characteristic parameters extracted from flame images. The oscillation frequency is derived from the spectral analysis of flame radiation signals. The measurements involved in these two methods do not require prior knowledge about fuel property, burner type, and other operation conditions. They can therefore be easily applied to flame stability assessment without costly and complex adaption. Experiments were carried out on a 9 -MW heavy-oil-fired combustion test rig over a wide range of combustion conditions including variations in swirl vane position of the tertiary air, swirl vane position of the secondary air, and the ratio of the primary air to the total air. The impact of these burner parameters on the stability of heavy oil flames is investigated by using the index and oscillation frequency proposed.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is one of most abundant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and a major driver of human-accelerated global climate change. <b>Fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plants are the single largest source of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions in the U. S. They emit approximately 2. 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, representing 40 percent of total U. S. CO 2 emissions (USEPA 2014). Carbon pollution standards that reduce CO 2 emissions from existing power plants can also cut emissions of other power plant pollutants that have negative human and environmental health impacts locally and regionally. These additional power plant pollutants (or, co-pollutants) include sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and mercury (Hg).

40|$|It must be {{stressed}} that {{the assessment of the}} exploitation possibilities of the energy resources discussed in this paper requires further studies. With this proviso, the situation can be provisionally summarised as follows: The total potential of known geothermal steam sources is only 64 GW. Geothermal energy could therefore only make a significant contribution to covering the worldwide power needs if we succeed in exploiting dry geothermal reservoirs. Exploitation of tidal energy is limited to a few geographically favourable locations. The power generation potential at these locations is only about 64 GW. An important drawback of tidal power is discontinuous power generation. Large scale exploitation of wind, wave and glacier energy, and of ocean heat, requires solution of a number of technological problems. The environmental effects of exploitation of these energy resources are to some extent of a qualitatively different nature from those of operation of <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> and of nuclear power plants. The scanty knowledge in this area often results in these effects being underestimated. In any case, however, it would be deliberately misleading to postulate that any form of power generation is possible without some detrimental effects on the environment. It may be stated in conclusion that, owing to their small potential or to the as yet insufficiently advanced technological development, none of the energy resources discussed in this paper can make a significant contribution to the solution of middle-term energy supply problems, i. e., to a rapid replacement of mineral oil and natural gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution has caused concerns about global warming. <b>Fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plants contribute approximately {{one third of the}} total human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide. Increased efficiency of these power plants will have a large impact on carbon dioxide emissions, but additional measures will be needed to slow or stop the projected increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. By accelerating the naturally occurring carbonation of magnesium silicate minerals it is possible to sequester carbon dioxide in the geologically stable mineral magnesite (MgCO 3). The carbonation of two classes of magnesium silicate minerals, olivine (Mg 2 SiO 4) and serpentine (Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4), was investigated in an aqueous process. The slow natural geologic process that converts both of these minerals to magnesite can be accelerated by increasing the surface area, increasing the activity of carbon dioxide in the solution, introducing imperfections into the crystal lattice by high-energy attrition grinding, {{and in the case of}} serpentine, by thermally activating the mineral by removing the chemically bound water. The effect of temperature is complex because it affects both the solubility of carbon dioxide and the rate of mineral dissolution in opposing fashions. Thus an optimum temperature for carbonation of olivine is approximately 185 degrees C and 155 degrees C for serpentine.

A review of methodologies and technologies for the monitoring of flame stability and burner condition is given, together with the discussions of existing problems and technical requirements in their applications. A technical strategy, incorporating optical sensing, digital imaging, digital signal/image processing and soft computing techniques, is proposed. Based on this strategy, a prototype flame imaging system is developed. The system consists of a rigid optical probe, an optical-bearn-splitting unit, an embedded photodetector and signal-processing board, a digital camera, and a mini-motherboard with associated application software.

The investigation {{has been developed}} with reference to power plants representative both of consolidated technology (i. e., steam cycle and combined cycle power plants), and of emerging or innovative technology (integrated coal gasification combined cycle, IGCC, and advanced mixed cycle, AMC). There are two main methods to reduce CO 2 from power plant flue gas: physical and chemical absorption. In this work chemical absorption and liquefaction of CO 2 removed have been considered. With reference to thermodynamical and economic performance, significant comparisons have been made between the above introduced reference plants. An efficiency decrease {{and an increase in}} the cost of electricity has been obtained when power plants are equipped with CO 2 removal systems and units for liquefaction of the removed carbon dioxide. The main results of the performed investigation are quite variable among the different power plants here considered: their efficiency decreases in a range of 6 percentage points to nearly 13, while the electricity production cost increases in a range of 25 % until 72 %. The AMC stands out among the other power plants here analyzed because, after CO 2 recovery, it exhibits the lowest net work output decrease, the highest net efficiency and the lowest final specific CO 2 emission. In addition to this, its economic impact is favorable when the AMC is equipped with systems for CO 2 recovery. As a result it achieves a net electric efficiency of about 50 % with a carbon dioxide emission of about 0. 04 kg/kWh, and the electricity production cost rises to about 25 % in comparison with an AMC without CO 2 removal and liquefaction systems.

The introduction of electric heating at the expense of classic heating increases the demand for electricity and generates a shift of emissions from fossil-fuel heating systems to electrical power plants. The replaced classic <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> heating represents emissions of about 300 [*]kton. With regard to the heat-pump scenarios, both direct heat-pump heating with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 2. 5 and accumulation heat-pump heating with a COP of 5 are investigated. The results of the simulations reveal that the massive introduction of heat-pump heating is favourable to the environment. In Belgium, the largest reductions in GHG emissions occur with heat pumps for direct heating, combined with newly commissioned combined cycle (CC) gas-fired plants or with accumulation heat-pump heating. These scenarios bring about overall GHG emission reductions of approximately 200 [*]kton compared with the reference case with conventional heating for the years 2000 and 2010. The amount of additional electricity-related emissions depends on the considered heating device. In 2010, the scenario with accumulation heat pumps results in an overall decrease of Belgian GHG emissions by 0. 15 % compared with the reference scenario. The expansion of the electricity-generation system with new CC plants has an important favourable impact on GHGs as well. In most cases, the combination of higher electricity demand and the construction of new gas-fired CC plants will lead to lower overall GHG emissions.

40|$|Concerns about {{elevated}} atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{and the effect}} on global climate have created proposals for the reduction of carbon emissions from large stationary sources, such as power plants. Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) in deep geologic units is being considered by Florida electric-utilities. Carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery (CO 2 -EOR) {{is a form of}} CCS that could offset some of the costs associated with geologic sequestration. Two potential reservoirs for geologic sequestration were evaluated in south-central and southern Florida: the Paleocene Cedar Keys Formation/Upper Cretaceous Lawson Formation (CKLIZ) and the Lower Cretaceous Sunniland Formation along the Sunniland Trend (Trend). The Trend is a slightly arcuate band in southwest Florida that is about 233 kilometers long and 32 kilometers wide, and contains oil plays within the Sunniland Formation at depths starting around 3, 414 meters below land surface, which are confined to mound-like structures made of coarse fossil fragments, mostly rudistids. The Trend commercial oil fields of the South Florida Basin have an average porosity of 16 % within the oil-producing Sunniland Formation, and collectively have an estimated storage capacity of around 26 million tons of CO 2. The Sunniland Formation throughout the entire Trend has an average porosity of 14 % and an estimated storage capacity of about 1. 2 billion tons of CO 2 (BtCO 2). The CKLIZ has an average porosity of 23 % and an estimated storage capacity of approximately 79 BtCO 2. Porous intervals within the CKLIZ and Sunniland Formation are laterally homogeneous, and low-permeability layers throughout the units provide significant vertical heterogeneity. The CKLIZ and Sunniland Formation are considered potentially suitable for CCS operations because of their geographic locations, appropriate depths, high porosities, estimated storage capacities, and potentiallyeffective seals. The Trend oil fields are suitable for CO 2 -EOR in the Sunniland Formation due to appropriate injected-CO 2 density, uniform intergranular porosity, suitable API density of formation-oil, sufficient production zones, and adequate remaining oil-in-place following secondary recovery. In addition to these in-depth investigations of the CKLIZ and Sunniland Formation, a more-cursory assessment of deep geologic units throughout the state of Florida, which includes rocks of Paleocene and Upper Cretaceous age through to rocks of Ordovician age, shows additional units in Florida that may be suitable for CO 2 -EOR and CCS operations. Furthermore, this study shows that deep geologic units throughout Florida potentially have the capacity to sequester billions of tons of CO 2 for hundreds of <b>fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plants. Geologic sequestration has not yet been conducted in Florida, and its implementation could prove useful to Florida utility companies, as well as to other energy-utilities in the southeastern United States...|$|E
40|$|Removal of acidic gases, in {{particular}} CO 2, {{is an important}} industrial operation. Carbon dioxide is produced in large quantities by <b>fossil–fuel–fired</b> power plants, steel production, the production of petrochemicals, cement production, and natural gas purification. The global climate change, where CO 2 {{is found to be}} a major contributor, {{is one of the most}} important and challenging environmental issues facing the world community. This has motivated intensive research on CO 2 capture and storage. Carbon dioxide capture by an absorption process is one of the most common industrial technologies today. Recent economic studies (Desideri and Corbelli, 1998) indicate that the process will also remain competitive in the future. One of the key improvements under development is new, faster and more energy–efficient absorbents. A chemical to be used as a commercial absorbent must have high net cyclic capacity, high absorption rate for CO 2, and good chemical stability. Alkanolamines are the most commonly used chemical absorbents for the removal of acidic gases today. In the first part of this thesis, an experimental screening of new absorbents for CO 2 capture was performed by absorption of CO 2 into both single absorbents and absorbent mixtures for amine–based and non–amine–based systems at 40 °C. From testing of ∼ 30 systems, it was found that an aqueous 30 mass % AEEA { 2 -(2 -aminoethyl-amino ethanol} solution seems to be a potentially good absorbent for capturing CO 2 from atmospheric flue gases. It offers high absorption rate combined with high absorption capacity. In addition to AEEA, MMEA (2 -(methylamino) ethanol) also needs to be considered. It could have a good potential when used in contactors where the two phases are separated, like in membrane contactors, whereas indications from the study showed foaming tendencies that will make it difficult to use in ordinary towers. AEEA as the selected absorbent obtained from the screening tests was further investigated to determine its vapor–liquid equilibrium characteristics. The experimental and modeling study of the solubility of CO 2 in aqueous AEEA is described in the second part of the thesis. From the VLE data, it is shown that AEEA does not only offer high absorption rate combined with high absorption capacity in terms of CO 2 loading but also offers higher cyclic capacity and lower regeneration energy requirement for some cases studied compared to MEA. In addition, a VLE thermodynamic modeling of the aqueous AEEA solution was performed by use of a modified Deshmukh–Mather model (Deshmukh and Mather, 1981) as well as NMR analyses to determine the species distribution in the liquid phase as function of CO 2 loading. A two–stage calculation was performed to model the VLE of the CO 2 –AEEA–H 2 O system. The first stage of the calculation was the regression of the parameters involved in the temperature dependency of the chemical equilibrium constants without binary interaction parameters taken into account. As seen from the results, the model provides a very good representation of the experimental data over a range of temperatures from 40 to 120 °C. The second regression of the VLE data was then performed to evaluate the binary interaction parameters i. e. the short–range terms in the Deshmukh–Mather model. However, only minor improvements in the overall fit were achieved. In the last part of the thesis, an experimental kinetic study of the CO 2 –AEEA–H 2 O system was performed using a string of disc contactor over a range of temperatures from 32 to 49 °C for various concentrations of AEEA. The reaction mechanism used for interpretation of the kinetics was the single step and termolecular mechanism approach proposed by Crooks and Donnellan (1989) and reviewed by da Silva and Svendsen (2004). The results showed that the observed pseudo–first order rate constant is in good agreement with the equation proposed for this mechanism. In addition, the physical properties, density and viscosity, have been measured to determine the physico–chemical parameters. The solubility of N 2 O in AEEA was also measured to estimate the solubility of CO 2 in AEEA solution. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Process Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Air {{pollution}} by {{sulfur dioxide}} {{is of great}} concern due to its harmful effects on environment, human beings, fauna and flora. <b>Fossil-fuel-fired</b> power plants {{are one of the}} major sources of SO 2 emissions. Typically the concentration of SO 2 in the flue gases of these plants is in the range of 2000 to 20000 ppm. Flue gas desulfurisation is one of the widely practiced strategies to control SO 2 emissions. Aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide catalysed by carbonaceous particles is an attractive alternative to the conventional processes for flue gas desulfurisation because, amongst other reasons, sulfuric acid, the product of aqueous phase oxidation, finds extensive application in industry. In the literature {{it has been reported that}} sulfuric acid affects the solubility of sulfur dioxide and that activated carbon catalyses aqueous phase oxidation. However there is hardly any report on the systematic evaluation of the mechanism of the heterogeneous aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide which takes into account among other factors, the effect of sulfuric acid on the solubility of SO 2 (particularly, at low levels of SO 2 and sulfuric acid concentrations). Therefore the objective of the present work is to evaluate systematically the aqueous phase oxidation of SO 2 in ppm levels with activated carbon as catalyst in a three-phase agitated slurry reactor and to model rigorously the solubility of SO 2 in ppm levels in dilute sulfuric acid solutions and to estimate the concerned parameters experimentally. Strong effect of dilute concentrations of sulfuric acid on the solubility of SO 2 is analyzed in terms of the influence of the acid on the equilibrium concentrations of the ionic species (HSO 3 ¯ and SO 4 ¯ 2 formed from the hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq) and the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 respectively) in SO 2 - dil. H 2 SO 4 systems. The analysis leads to a general expression relating the partial pressure of SO 2 in the gas phase to the concentration of total dissolved SO 2 and the concentration of sulfuric acid in the solution. Simple equations are obtained from the general expression for the cases of zero and high concentrations of sulfuric acid in the system, which in turn lead to direct experimental determination of the parameters, Henry's law constant and the equilibrium constant of hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq). The developed model predicts the present experimental data as well as the data reported in the literature very closely. The dissolution of SO 2, the hydrolysis of SO 2 (aq) and the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 are found to be instantaneous. From the dependency of the parameters on temperature, the heat of dissolution of SO 2 is determined to be - 31. 47 kJ mol" 1 and the heat of hydrolysis to be 15. 69 kJ mol" 1. The overall heat of solubility of sulfur dioxide is therefore - 15. 78 kJ mol" 1. Preliminary reaction experiments have clearly indicated that SO 2 (aq) does not react and HSO 3 ¯ is the only reactant for aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide catalysed by activated carbon. The non-reactant SO 2 (aq) deactivates the oxidation reaction by competing with HSO 3 ¯ for adsorption on the active sites of the catalyst particles. However the catalyst particles become saturated with SO 2 (aq) beyond a certain value of its concentration (saturation limit), which depends on temperature. A mechanism is proposed based on these observations to develop a rate model. The rate model also takes into account the effect of the concentration of the product sulfuric acid on the solubility of sulfur dioxide. The model predicts first order in HSO 3 ¯, half order in dissolved oxygen and a linear deactivation effect of 5 O 2 (ag). The oxidation reaction is evaluated experimentally at various levels of the operating variables such as temperature and the concentrations of sulfur dioxide and oxygen in the inlet gas. In all experiments a pseudo steady-state region is observed where the gas phase concentration of SO 2 reaches a steady value but the concentrations of HSO 3 ¯ and total S (VI) in the liquid phase continue to change. Pseudo steady-state considerations lead to the determination of the initial estimates of the parameters of the rate model namely, the rate constant and the deactivation constant. These parameters are estimated from the transient profiles of the product (sulfuric acid) by solving the model equations by Runge-Kutta method along with Marquardt's non-linear parameter estimation algorithm. The predictions of the model with the estimated parameters match very well with the experimentally observed concentration profiles of S(VI) and HSO 3 in the liquid phase and SO 2 in the gas phase. The deactivation constant in the saturation range is independent of temperature and is 0. 27, which indicates that the intrinsic rate constant is about four times greater than the observed rate constant. From Arrhenius equation-type dependency of the parameters on temperature, the activation energy for the oxidation reaction is determined to be 93. 55 kJ mol" 1 and for deactivation to be 21. 4 kJ mol" 1. The low value of activation energy for deactivation suggests a weak dependency of the deactivation on temperature, which perhaps is due to the weak nature of the chemisorption of SO 2 (aq) on carbon...|$|E
