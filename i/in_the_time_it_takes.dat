5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, {{less than that of}} Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E

25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} about 4.3 times faster in water (1,484m/s in fresh water) {{as it is}} in air (343m/s).

25|$|A binary {{resonance}} {{ratio in}} {{this article should be}} interpreted as the ratio of number of orbits completed in the same time interval, rather than as the ratio of orbital periods, which would be the inverse ratio.

In the case of resonance relationships between three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used (in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other) and the type of ratio will be specified.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the study}} of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis larvae, {{barbiturates}} were found to increase {{the length of the}} larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to reach the stage of pupation. Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development. However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults. Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.|$|E
25|$|Another {{scene in}} the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt to run around the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.|$|E

2500|$|This {{deflection}} may equivalently {{be described}} as a light-time effect due to motion of the Earth during the 8.3minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth.

2500|$|One {{scene in}} the 1981 film Chariots of Fire recreates a race in which the runners attempt to round the {{perimeter}} of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the clock to double strike the hour at midday or midnight.

Known as the Great Court Run, students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the evening of the matriculation dinner. The only persons recognised to have actually completed the run in time are David Cecil in 1927 and Sam Dobin in 2007. It was thought that Coe had succeeded when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988 in a time of 42.53 seconds. A video of the race, however, apparently shows that Coe was 12 metres short of the finish line when the last chime sounded, so Trinity College never officially accepted his time.|$|E
