5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E
25|$|He was <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> {{than five}} feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His head {{was exactly the}} shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His {{moustache}} was very stiff and military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible.|$|E

He is one of the numerous descendants of the Emperor's chief cook; after saving Jim and Luke from a treacherous and manipulative minister, he is made Prime Minister of China by the Emperor - a role which he fulfills surprisingly capably.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the season Hunt and Horsley had written off both of the team's Formula Three cars. Horsley decided to leave the cockpit, {{switching}} to the team's management. Hesketh rented a Formula Two March for the rest of 1972, and bought Hunt a Surtees Formula Two car for 1973. Hunt then promptly wrote the car off at the Pau Grand Prix, and in typical style, Hesketh worked out that the cost involved in competing in the top flight was <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> expensive than F2, and decided to move the team up to Formula One.|$|E
25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E
25|$|In 1808, {{soon after}} the death of his mother, he was {{appointed}} superintendent of the private library of Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, into which Hesse-Kassel had been incorporated by Napoleon. Bonaparte appointed him an auditor to the state council, while Grimm retained his superintendent post. His salary was increased in a short period of time from 2000 to 4000 francs and his official duties were <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than nominal. After the expulsion of Bonaparte and the reinstatement of an elector, Grimm was appointed Secretary of Legation in 1813, accompanying the Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army. In 1814, he was sent to Paris to demand restitution of books carried off by the French, and he also attended the Congress of Vienna as Secretary of Legation, 1814–1815. Upon his return from Vienna, he was sent to Paris a second time to secure book restitutions.|$|E

25|$|The festivities {{marking the}} birth of the Crown Prince, however, were short-lived. Less than eight months after joining the {{coalition}} government, Milan Grol and Ivan Šubašić resigned their offices of Vice-Prime Minister (18 August) and Foreign Minister (8 October), respectively, to mark their political disagreement with Marshal Tito. Faced with the rise of the Communists, King Peter II decided, to withdraw his confidence from the Regency Council and regain all his sovereign prerogatives in Yugoslavia (8 August). Tito responded by immediately depriving the Royal Family of the civil list, which was soon to have dramatic consequences {{in the lives of the}} royal couple. Especially, Tito ordered the organization of early elections to a Constituent Assembly. The campaign took place in an irregular way, in the middle of pressures and violence of all kinds, with the opposition deciding to boycott the poll. On 24 November 1945 a single list presented by the communists was proposed to voters: while there were <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 Communists throughout Yugoslavia before the war, their candidates list obtained more than 90% of the votes in the referendum.|$|E
25|$|The next eleven poems {{relate to}} the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady of high station and, {{according}} to Moritz Haupt's conjecture, the daughter of Valeria, Messalla's sister. The Sulpicia elegies divide into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in which {{the theme of the}} attachment is worked up into five graceful poems. The second, iv. 8-12, consists of Sulpicia's own letters. They are very short, only forty lines in all; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a Roman woman that have survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings remind us of Catullus. The style and metrical handling betray a novice in poetical writing. The thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius. The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship. Last of all comes the epigram or fragment of Domitius Marsus already referred to.|$|E
25|$|Leaving the {{hospital}} in May 1893 {{he went to the}} Far East, and in February 1894 began a journey from Shanghai to Rangoon. He went partly by boat up the Yangtze River and rode and walked the remainder of the 3,000 miles (4,800km). He completed the journey in 100 days at a total cost of £18, which included the wages of two or three Chinese servants whom he picked up and changed on the way as he entered new districts. He was quite unarmed and then knew <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a dozen words of Chinese. But he was willing to conform to and respect the customs of the people he met, and everywhere was received with courtesy. In his interesting account of his journey, An Australian in China, published in 1895, while speaking well of the personalities of the many missionaries he met, he consistently belittled their success in obtaining converts. In after years he regretted this, as he felt he had given a wrong impression by not sufficiently stressing the value of their social and medical work.|$|E

[...] In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes {{published a}} second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed [...] "a very great liking" [...] for Wheeler, having {{first met him}} when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had [...] "a daemonic energy", with his accomplishments in India being [...] "almost superhuman". Ultimately, she {{thought of him as}} being [...] "an epic hero in an anti-heroic age" [...] in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.|$|E

But, on the other hand, he did not equally succeed in attaining elegance, an object at which he seems equally to have aimed. There is a curious affectation about his style—a falsetto note—which, notwithstanding all his efforts to please, is often irritating to the reader. Its main characteristic is perhaps best hit off by Charles Lamb when he calls it genteel. He poses too much as a fine gentleman, and is so anxious not to be taken for a pedant of the vulgar scholastic kind that he falls into the <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> attractive pedantry of the aesthete and virtuoso.

2500|$|Starting on March 10, 1775 Boone, {{along with}} 35 axmen, cut a trail from Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee through {{the forests and}} {{mountains}} to Kentucky. It was a rough mud trail, <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a path. The Transylvania Company had obtained title to Kentucky from the Cherokee and Iroquois, and even the Shawnee chief Cornstalk, defeated in Dunmore's War, had promised at the Treaty of Camp Charlotte on October 19, 1774 that his tribe would no longer hunt or claim land south of the Ohio River in Kentucky. Notwithstanding this promise, the Shawnee viewed Boone and other settlers as invaders. On March 24, 1775 Boone and his party were only [...] from their final destination of the Kentucky River when they camped for the night. [...] Just before daybreak a group of Shawnee, slinging [...] tomahawks, attacked the sleeping men. Some of Boone's party were killed and a few were wounded but most were able to escape into the woods. Boone regrouped his men and managed to drive off the hostile Shawnee. The party did, however, lose some of their horses. Here Boone built a temporary open barricade with 6 to [...] high logs.|$|E
2500|$|Many Early Devonian plants did {{not have}} true roots or leaves like extant plants and {{vascular}} tissue {{has yet to be}} observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as Drepanophycus likely spread by vegetative growth and primitive spores. The earliest land plants such as Cooksonia consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes and terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a few centimeters tall. By far the largest land organism during this period was the enigmatic Prototaxites, which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than 8 meters tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest known trees, from the genus Wattieza, appeared in the Late Devonian around 385 Mya. In the Late Devonian, the tree-like ancestral Progymnosperm Archaeopteris which had conifer-like true wood and fern-like foliage and the cladoxylopsids grew. (See also: lignin.) These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the [...] "Devonian Explosion".|$|E
2500|$|Victorian critics {{praised the}} poem and some {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} poem's background. John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is <b>hardly</b> <b>more</b> than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E
