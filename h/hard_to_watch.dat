5|$|Tracy, {{yearning to}} be taken more seriously, tries to earn an EGOT while {{starring}} in the movie <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Watch</b> and Jenna meets a new love interest {{who is also a}} straight drag queen (Will Forte) and meets her mother, Verna (Jan Hooks). However, things don't go well for Kenneth as certain events lead to endangering his job as an NBC page.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe Award {{for his role in}} the drama feature <b>Hard</b> <b>To</b> <b>Watch</b> but realizes that in order to win the award he needs to act as a serious actor. As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch—a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto—for a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against showing it, realizing that laughter is the best medicine and instead screens The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas. The people in the shelter find the movie hilarious thus making Tracy happy.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) informs [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that {{he wishes}} {{to be part of}} the film Garfield 3: Feline Groovy. Dot Com and Kenneth tell Tracy that he should instead focus on his chances of getting an Oscar, as part of his EGOT quest. The two {{encourage}} him to audition for <b>Hard</b> <b>To</b> <b>Watch,</b> a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto, something that Tracy can directly relate to. Tracy decides to audition for <b>Hard</b> <b>To</b> <b>Watch,</b> but realizes that playing the role may bring up too many repressed memories. Dot Com and Kenneth, along with Tracy, visit all the places from Tracy's childhood in order to prepare him for the role, but this backfires when Tracy is brought to tears because of his past.|$|E
5000|$|The Futon Critic {{named it}} the fifth best episode of 2002, saying [...] "You'd be <b>hard</b> pressed <b>to</b> find a <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> {{sequence}} {{than this one}} in 2002 as Poot and Bodie {{have to step up}} and get rid of the gentle and kind-hearted Wallace. I get the shivers just thinking about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{performed}} at Roadburn 2016, with Brooklyn Vegan's Ian Cory writing that [...] "once the house lights came up it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> justify <b>watching</b> anything else." [...] This {{was part of}} their series of shows performed in celebration of their 30th anniversary as a band.|$|R
60|$|Ned's {{words were}} prophetic. In less than half-an-hour {{after they were}} uttered a long-visaged Yankee, in a straw hat, nankeen trousers, and fisherman's boots, came {{to the spot where}} they were at work, and seated himself on the trunk of a tree <b>hard</b> by <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> their proceedings.|$|R
500|$|This was {{the third}} time the show {{referenced}} Tracy Jordan {{trying to get his}} EGOT. This plot first began in the December 3, 2009, episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Tracy finds a diamond encrusted [...] "EGOT" [...] necklace and sets a new life goal to achieve EGOT status by winning four major awards: an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. In [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", Tracy decides to do the movie <b>Hard</b> <b>To</b> <b>Watch,</b> in hopes that he can get an Oscar for his performance.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and {{that allows us to}} watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Masters [...] "grew up in a prefab on the Old Kent Road", Southwark to a [...] "hunchback" [...] {{mother with}} a weak chest and an illegitimate [...] "no hoper" [...] father. During his adolescence, after he asked to {{interview}} television personality Gilbert Harding for the school magazine he had launched, <b>Harding</b> became close <b>to</b> him, and functioned as a mentor. Masters was apparently quite unfazed when <b>Harding</b> asked <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> him bathe.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{hard and}} an {{unnecessary}} waste {{of space to}} grade this misery. <b>Hardest,</b> perhaps, is <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> prominent actors make cameos as imbecile canal guardians without succeeding transforming the idiocy to humour.

50|$|In July 2002 Hong {{made his}} film debut, {{starring}} as {{himself in the}} lead role of the satirical comedy Emergency Act 19 (긴급조치 19호). While the film featured many Korean entertainers as guests, the film received largely negative reviews. During an appearance on New X-Man, Hong mentioned the film as something that he was embarrassed about, but remarked that it was <b>hard</b> not <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it simply {{because it was so}} bad.|$|R
500|$|After his co-stars Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller, Jan Hooks and Dana Carvey had left, Hartman {{said he felt}} [...] "like {{an athlete}} who's watched all his World Series {{teammates}} get traded off into other directions [...] It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> them leave because I sort of felt we were {{all part of the}} team that saved the show." [...] This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994. Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991, but Michaels convinced him to stay to raise his profile; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal. Jay Leno offered him the role of his sidekick on The Tonight Show but Hartman opted to stay on SNL. NBC persuaded him to stay on SNL by promising him his own comedy–variety show entitled The Phil Show. He planned to [...] "reinvent the variety form" [...] with [...] "a hybrid, very fast-paced, high energy [...] with sketches, impersonations, pet acts, and performers showcasing their talents". Hartman was to be the show's executive producer and head writer. Before production began, however, the network decided that variety shows were too unpopular and scrapped the series. In a 1996 interview, Hartman noted he was glad the show had been scrapped, as he [...] "would've been sweatin' blood each week trying to make it work". In 1998, he admitted he missed working on SNL, but had enjoyed the move from New York City to Southern California.|$|E
2500|$|The fictional Colbert anchorman {{character}} became gradually {{toned down}} {{over the course of}} the show's run, as the host believed he would eventually need to move beyond it. He began to regard it as an act of discipline to perform as the character; he later remarked, [...] "to model behavior, you have to consume that behavior on a regular basis. It became very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> punditry of any kind, of whatever political stripe." [...] With his contract set to end in December 2014, he had already decided to leave the show when he was contacted by CBS to replace David Letterman as the host of its Late Show franchise. The show's ending was announced concurrently with Colbert's jump to CBS in April 2014. The last episode aired on December 18, 2014. The show was replaced on Comedy Central's late-night lineup by The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, another spinoff of The Daily Show.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has {{interacted with}} the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E
5000|$|Abdul {{criticized the}} way the program's {{segments}} were edited. She explained, [...] "That was <b>hard</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> Disturbing. They’d put a camera on me when I got wind that my dog was in a coma, and they’d make it (seem) like it was about hair and makeup." ...|$|R
500|$|The World Bank's lead {{economist}} David McKenzie {{remarked that}} some of Psy's dance moves [...] "kind of look like a regression discontinuity", while the space agency NASA called [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] a dance-filled music video that has forever entered {{the hearts and minds}} of millions of people. Melissa Locker of Time noted that [...] "it's <b>hard</b> not <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> again ...and again ...and again", while CNN reporter Shanon Cook told the audience that she had watched [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] about 15 times.|$|R
60|$|One day Nanina {{had begun}} to read to him as usual, but had not {{proceeded}} far before Marta Angrisani informed {{her that he had}} fallen into a doze. She ceased with a sigh, and sat looking at him sadly, as he lay near her, faint and pale and mournful in his sleep--miserably altered from what he was when she first knew him. It had been a <b>hard</b> trial <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> by his bedside in the terrible time of his delirium; but it was a <b>harder</b> trial still <b>to</b> look at him now, and to feel less and less hopeful with each succeeding day.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ask me so many questions," [...] he murmured, [...] "and I {{tell you}} that I know nothing. I have asked you to come here with me because I had just this to say. I can answer no questions, offer no explanations. I have no {{particular}} liking for you, but I am afflicted with a cursedly sensitive disposition, and--there are things which I find it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> with equanimity. There is a train for England at nine o'clock this evening, Sir George. Take it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind, Augustine--no {{one is to}} tell my children--I can't {{have them}} disturbed--over a little thing--like this--and in my purse you'll find another--hundred-franc note. I shall want some more francs for the day after to-morrow. Be a good girl and don't fuss, and kiss poor Polly, and mind--I won't have a doctor--taking him away from his work. Give me my gelseminum and my prayer-book. And go to bed just as usual--we must all--keep smiling--like the dear soldiers--" [...] The {{whispering}} ceased, then began again at once in rapid delirious incoherence. And the girl sat trembling, covering now her ears from those uncanny sounds, now {{her eyes from the}} flush and the twitching of that face, usually so pale and still. She could not follow--with her little English--the swerving, intricate flights of that old spirit mazed by fever--the memories released, the longings disclosed, the half-uttered prayers, the curious little half-conscious efforts to regain form and dignity. She could only pray to the Virgin. When relieved by the daughter of Madame's French friend, who spoke good English, she murmured desperately: [...] "Oh! mademoiselle, madame est très fatiguée--la pauvre tête--faut-il enlever les cheveux? Elle fait ça toujours pour elle-même." [...] For, to the girl, with her reverence for the fastidious dignity which never left her mistress, it seemed sacrilege to divest her of her crown of fine grey hair. Yet, when it was done and the old face crowned only by the thin white hair of nature, that dignity was still there surmounting the wandering talk and the moaning from her parched lips, which every now and then smiled and pouted in a kiss, as if remembering the maxims of the parrot. So the night passed, with all that could be done for her, whose most collected phrase, frequently uttered in the doctor's face, was: [...] "Mind, Augustine, I won't have a doctor--I can manage for myself quite well." [...] Once for a few minutes her spirit seemed to recover its coherence, and she was heard to whisper: [...] "God has given me this so that I may know what the poor soldiers suffer. Oh! they've forgotten to cover Polly's cage." [...] But high fever soon passes from the very old; and early morning brought a deathlike exhaustion, with utter silence, save for the licking of the flames at the olive-wood logs, and the sound as they slipped or settled down, calcined. The firelight crept fantastically about the walls covered with tapestry of French-grey silk, crept round the screen-head of the couch, and betrayed the ivory pallor of that mask-like face, which covered now such tenuous threads of life. Augustine, who had come on guard when the fever died away, sat in the armchair before those flames, trying <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> but dropping off into the healthy sleep of youth. And out in the clear, hard shivering Southern cold, the old clocks chimed the hours into the winter dark, where, remote from man's restless spirit, the old town brooded above plain and river under the morning stars. And the girl dreamed--dreamed of a sweetheart under the acacias by her home, of his pinning their white flowers into her hair, till she woke with a little laugh. Light was already coming through the shutter chinks, the fire was but red embers and white ash. She gathered it stealthily together, put on fresh logs, and stole over to the couch. Oh! how white! how still! Was her mistress dead? The icy clutch of that thought jerked her hands up to her full breast, and a cry mounted in her throat. The eyes opened. The white lips parted, as if to smile; a voice whispered: [...] "Now, don't be silly!" [...] The girl's cry changed into a little sob, and bending down she put her lips to the ringed hand that lay outside the quilt. The hand moved faintly as if responding, the voice whispered: [...] "The emerald ring is for you, Augustine. Is it morning? Uncover Polly's cage, and open his door." ...|$|E

25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the <b>hardest</b> one <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|R
5000|$|Jónsi is a {{vegetarian}}. He {{states that}} he [...] "didn’t go vegetarian because of the animals" [...] but became gradually more concerned for their welfare.

Someone who knew exactly who he was and what he did for a living. If we are lucky, his ghost will haunt Flint’s psyche in the future. One of his last monologues is often quoted but I will end with it here because it not only sums up the man, but the future of all the souls that hit the beach of New Providence, Nassau: [...] "There are no legacies in this life.

60|$|When Harding {{went out}} into the street, he was met by a cloud of {{swirling}} dust. He wiped the grit from his eyes and brushed it off his clothes with an annoyance that was not accounted for by the slight discomfort it caused him. The sun was fiercely hot, the glare trying, and the plank sidewalks and the fronts of the wooden stores had begun to crack. Sand and cement from half-finished buildings were blowing down the street; and when <b>Harding</b> stopped <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> a sprinkler at work on a lawn at the corner of an avenue where frame houses stood among small trees, the glistening shower vanished as it fell. There were fissures in the hard soil and the grass looked burnt. But it was the curious, hard brightness of the sky and the way the few white clouds swept across it that gave Harding food for thought.|$|R
30|$|In {{control room}} 1, {{operators}} always face {{a wall and}} people entering {{through one of the}} doors cannot immediately see their displays, other operators need to actively turn around to do so.
