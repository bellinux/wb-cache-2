The unemployment rate (11.1%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average, but the disaggregated figure is 6.6% in the North and 19.2% in the South.|$|E
25|$|He {{vowed to}} {{transform}} Russia's socialist economy into a capitalist market economy and implemented economic shock therapy, price liberalization, and nationwide privatization. Due to the sudden total economic shift, {{a majority of}} the national property and wealth fell into the hands of a small number of oligarchs. The well-off millionaire and billionaire oligarchs likened themselves to 19th century robber barons. Rather than creating new enterprises, Yeltsin's democratization led to international monopolies hijacking the former Soviet markets, arbitraging the <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market.|$|E
25|$|The Leduc {{discovery}} and {{the string of}} even bigger ones that followed rapidly backed imported oil out of the Canadian prairies and produced a huge surplus of oil which had no immediate market. In 1949, Imperial Oil applied {{to the federal government}} to build the Interprovincial Pipeline (IPL) to Lake Superior, and in 1950 it was completed to the port of Superior, Wisconsin. Many people questioned why it was built to an American port rather than a Canadian one, but the federal government was more interested in the fact that oil exports made a <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> to Canada's trade balance and completely erased the country's balance of trade deficit.|$|E

The Sportimes completely dominated the Lobsters winning all five sets and taking the match by a score of 25–7. Martina Hingis made a <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> for the Sportimes who had lost both of their regular-season encounters with the Lobsters without her. Hingis won the women's singles set over Martina Navratilova, 5–2, combined with Jenny Hopkins to win the women's doubles, 5–2, over Navratilova and Kristen Schlukebir and paired with Rajeev Ram to top Navratilova and Johan Landsberg in mixed doubles, 5–2.

25|$|Rashid Khalidi made a {{comparison}} between the Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, and the Palestinian Arabs on the one hand, and between the Palestinian Arabs and other Arabs on the other hand. From 1922 to 1947 the annual growth rate of the Jewish {{sector of the economy}} was 13.2%, mainly due to immigration and foreign capital, while that of the Arab was 6.5%. Per capita these figures were 4.8% and 3.6% respectively. By 1936 the Jewish sector had eclipsed the Arab one, and Jewish individuals earned 2.6 times as much as Arabs. Compared to other Arab countries the Palestinian Arab individuals earned slightly better. In terms of human capital there was a <b>huge</b> <b>difference.</b> For instance the literacy rates in 1932 were 86% for the Jews against 22% for the Palestinian Arabs, but Arab literacy was steadily increasing. In this respect the Palestinian Arabs compared favorably to Egypt and Turkey, but unfavorably to Lebanon. On the scale of the UN Human Development Index determined for around 1939, of 36 countries, Palestinian Jews were placed 15th, Palestinian Arabs 30th, Egypt 33rd and Turkey 35th. The Jews in Palestine were mainly urban, 76.2% in 1942, while the Arabs were mainly rural, 68,3% in 1942. Overall Khalidi concludes that the Palestinian Arab society, while being overmatched by the Yishuv, was as advanced as any other Arab society in the region and considerably more as several.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{show that}} this {{conclusion}} is fundamentally flawed, as it rests on neglecting the influence of population heterogeneity in correlations exhibited {{at the level of}} the whole population. Tomasetti and Vogelstein’s results quantify nicely that a large part of the differences in organ-specific cancer risk can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions in different tissues. But the logical fallacy is to extrapolate that, because environmental and genetic factors cannot explain the <b>huge</b> <b>differences</b> in cancer rates between different organs, then these factors play a minor role in cancer rates. In contrast, {{we show that}} one can indeed measure <b>huge</b> <b>differences</b> in cancer rates between different organs and at the same time observe a strong effect of environmental and genetic factors in cancer rates.|$|R

500|$|However much {{planning}} an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity, the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival, especially {{as they would}} lack any understanding of the contacting civilization. Ben Finney compares the situation {{to that of the}} tribespeople of New Guinea, an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the last glacial period but saw little {{contact with the outside world}} until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> between the indigenous stone-age society and the Europeans' technical civilization caused unexpected behaviors among the native populations known as cargo cults: to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed, the natives created wooden [...] "radio stations" [...] and [...] "airstrips" [...] as a form of sympathetic magic. Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth, much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies. He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study, rather than as fast, sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines.|$|E

500|$|It is {{difficult}} to fit chancelloriids into classifications of sponges or more complex animals. An analysis in 1996 concluded that they were closely related to sponges {{on the grounds that}} the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites ("armor plates") is similar to that of fibers of spongin, a collagen protein, in [...] modern keratose (horny) demosponges such as Darwinella. However another analysis in 2002 concluded that chancelloriids are not sponges and may be intermediate between sponges and more complex animals, among other reasons because their skins were thicker and more tightly connected than those of sponges. In 2008 a detailed analysis of chancelloriids' sclerites concluded that they were very similar to those of halkieriids, mobile bilaterian animals that looked like slugs in chain mail and whose fossils are found in rocks from the very Early Cambrian to the Mid Cambrian. If this is correct, it would create a dilemma, as it is extremely unlikely that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the <b>huge</b> <b>difference</b> in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related.|$|E
