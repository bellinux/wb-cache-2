5000|$|Thruxton handlebars, {{a type of}} {{motorcycle}} handlebar that {{is shaped}} to provide a clip-on-type handlebar position, but which clamps {{on top of the}} yoke rather than onto the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions.</b> Thruxton handlebars are also known as [...] "Ace 'bars" [...] or [...] "Clubman 'bars".|$|R
50|$|While {{its engine}} was revolutionary, in other respects, such as appearance, {{suspension}} and brakes, the Norton Classic was a conventional twin-shock roadster. The <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions</b> were protected by rubber gaiters; {{and a full}} enclosure protected the final-drive chain. The air-cooled Classic was lighter and more powerful than its only Wankel competitor in production, the over-complicated single-rotor Suzuki RE-5 motorcycle (which had liquid-cooled jackets and an oil-cooled rotor).|$|R
5000|$|The {{intermediate}} {{model was}} known as the 748S. This had lighter 5-spoke Marchesini wheels in grey to match the grey frame, also retaining the earlier adjustable steering head. The rear shock was now a Showa unit with Showa forks at the front, making use of Titanium-Nitride (TiN) coating on the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions</b> to [...] "reduce stiction", which also gave it a gold coloring. The engine was the same as the 748E.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Telescopic {{upside down}} (USD) <b>fork</b> with <b>stanchions</b> at the bottom. The right fork tube {{can be seen}} held by {{the upper and lower}} triple clamp of the triple tree.|$|R
50|$|The GT550 {{introductory}} {{model was}} Suzuki's counter to Kawasaki H1 Mach III. The GT550 had a massive four leading shoe double panel drum front brake {{shared with the}} GT750. The conventional telescopic front forks had rubber gaiters covering the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions.</b> Both fenders were chromed steel. Chrome and polished aluminum were used {{on the rest of}} the bike. The fuel cap was, unusually for the times, lockable and this was carried on through to the end of production. The rear turn signal lenses were red. Engine cooling was by the Ram Air system. First year sales were 11,000+ units.|$|R
50|$|To prevent {{water and}} dirt from {{damaging}} the suspension, gaiters {{have been used}} to cover the <b>fork's</b> <b>stanchions.</b> However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move {{in and out of the}} cavity between gaiter and <b>stanchion</b> as the <b>fork</b> moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern dust wipers and seals keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor.|$|R
50|$|The Evo {{features}} 50 mm Marzocchi {{forks and}} a Sachs rear shock, but the Evo SP features specially developed (1.2") taller 50 mm Marzocchi forks {{together with an}} Ohlins rear shock. The colour of the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions</b> on both models is now black, the Evo SP also featuring a black DLC coating to the lower fork section. The Evo SP has a seat height of 875 mm and is deliberately the taller bike because Ducati say that racers were asking for more ground clearance. The Evo, and all previous Hypermotard 1100 models, has a seat height of 845 mm. To complement the increased ride height of the Evo SP, it features handlebars that sit 20 mm higher than those on the base model. The speedo unit is now similar to that fitted to the Ducati Streetfighter, with white backlighting.|$|R
5000|$|Conventionally, the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions</b> {{are at the}} top, clamped to {{a triple}} tree (also called a triple clamp or a yoke), and the sliders are at the bottom, {{attached}} to the front wheel spindle. On some modern sport bikes and most off-road bikes, this system is inverted, with [...] "sliders" [...] (complete with the spring/damper unit) at the top, clamped to the yoke, while the stanchions are at the bottom. This is done (i) to reduce unsprung weight by having the heavier components suspended, and (ii) to improve the strength and rigidity of the assembly by having the strong large-diameter [...] "sliders" [...] clamped in the yokes. The inverted system {{is referred to as}} an upside-down fork, or [...] "USD" [...] for short. A disadvantage of this USD design is that the entire reservoir of damping oil is above the slider seal so that, if the slider seal were to leak, the oil could drain out, rendering any damping ineffective.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the company}} {{developed}} {{a series of}} motorcycles based on the T35. Designed by George Halliday, these featured Douglas [...] "Radialraulic" [...] forks with the front wheel spindle carried on short leading links pivoted {{at the rear of}} the <b>fork</b> <b>stanchions</b> - with springs and a damping mechanism inside the stanchions. Although the frame and suspension were innovative, the engine was essentially a generator, designed to run for long periods at a steady speed and it did not cope well with the varying engine speeds of motorcycling. There was also a tendency to sideways shaking at low engine speeds which was a feature of the horizontally opposed engine. Douglas hired former Sunbeam motorcycles designer Erling Poppe as Technical Director, Freddie Dixon as their specialist engine tuner and Walter Moore (who designed the Norton CS1) as Works Superintendent. The result was the 1949 Douglas Mark III, which had improved performance through an uprated cylinder head, combustion chambers, and pistons. Douglas also produced a Mark III [...] "De Luxe", a Mark III Sports, and a rigid-framed motorcycle trials Competition version with high-level exhausts and a less deeply valanced front mudguard. There never was a Douglas Mark II, and the Mark IV was short-lived, so the end of the line of development was the Mark V produced between 1951 and 1954, when it was replaced by the Douglas Dragonfly.|$|R
5000|$|Developed by Saxon-Motodd in Britain in {{the early}} 1980s, the Telelever fork aims to improve {{handling}} stability during cornering and braking. The Telelever uses conventional telescopic <b>forks,</b> but the <b>stanchions</b> contain only lubricating oil. Springing and damping functions are dealt with by a monoshock attached to a [...] "Telelever" [...] wishbone. The wishbone pivots {{on the front of}} the engine block, and the wishbone's forward end is attached via a rose-joint to a brace connecting the fork sliders. As there is no lower triple clamp, the fork sliders are longer and lighter than on a conventional telescopic fork, and the greater slider/tube overlap reduces both torsional flex and unsprung weight.|$|R
