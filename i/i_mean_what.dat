Color Field painting? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>what</b> is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E

500|$|Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided {{the grieving}} process. He commented, [...] "you {{have to get}} back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the {{situation}} I was thrown into. But, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>what</b> do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.' So, that's what I did." [...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E

500|$|Byard {{pointed out}} that the use of humor did not mean that his music was not serious: [...] "I might do it with humor, but it's still serious because <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>what</b> I'm doing". He stated that his choice to play in a variety of styles was not imitatory or superficial: [...] "I can't play one way all night; I wouldn't want to and I wouldn't want the public to hear me that way". One {{obituary}} writer noted that, [...] "Nobody thinks it odd if a pianist underpins melody with stride patterns or a boogie bass. When Byard did that 30 years ago, distinctions were drawn more tightly". Music writer Dan Lander also stated that Byard's playing was ahead of its time, and added that it has influenced 21st-century pianists: Byard's grasp and integration of historical forms, his ability to embrace tradition and risk taking, was visionary, impacting on a new generation of jazz musicians who understood the history of jazz as a material to build on and work with, at the service of creating something new, rather than as an unmovable weight, fixing them to the past.|$|E

2500|$|Tatum {{tended to}} work and to record unaccompanied, partly because {{relatively}} few musicians could keep pace with his fast tempos and advanced harmonic vocabulary. Other musicians expressed amazed bewilderment at performing with Tatum. Drummer Jo Jones, who recorded a 1956 trio session with Tatum and bassist Red Callender, is quoted as quipping, [...] "I didn't even play on that session [...] all I did was listen. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>what</b> could I add?

2500|$|PAUL: I believe very {{sincerely}} {{that the}} CIA is correct when they teach {{and talk about}} blowback. When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback.

2500|$|Guitarist Keith Wallen and bassist Aaron Bruch {{performed}} all of {{the background}} vocals on Dark Before Dawn, unlike previous albums on which Burnley performed his own. Burnley stated that background vocals were worked on the most in regard to producing, elaborating on That Metal Show, [...] "Because, guitars are guitars, you know, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>what</b> are you gonna do, you can tune them and all these things, but singing is a totally different animal so that's where {{we spent a lot}} of time.

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>what</b> I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E

2500|$|In Chapter 58 it is {{suggested}} that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene created a [...] "potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne." [...] Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is without any historical basis, but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a [...] "mortal prophet", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would not have any interest in him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, [...] "Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>what</b> does that mean? If he's not God, why is he married to a goddess?" [...] Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered [...] "rightful" [...] heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea.|$|E
