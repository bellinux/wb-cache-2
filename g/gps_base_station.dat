40|$|Event {{and state}} {{detection}} in time series has significant value in scientific areas and real-world applications. The aim of detecting time series event and state patterns {{is to identify}} particular variations of user-interest {{in one or more}} channels of time series streams. For example, dangerous driving behaviours such as sudden braking and harsh acceleration can be detected from continuous recordings from inertial sensors. However, the existing methods are highly dependent on domain knowledge such as the size of the time series pattern and a set of effective features. Furthermore, they are not directly suitable for multi-channel time series data. In this study, we establish a genetic programming based method which can perform classification on multi-channel time series data. It does not need the domain knowledge required by the existing methods. The investigation consists of four parts: the methodology, an evaluation on event detection tasks, an evaluation on state detection tasks and an analysis on the suitability for real-world applications. In the methodology, a <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method is proposed for processing and analysing multi-channel time series streams. The function set includes basic mathematical operations. In addition, specific functions and terminals are introduced to reserve historical information, capture temporal dependency across time points and handle dependency between channels. These functions and terminals help the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method to automatically find the pattern size and extract features. This study also investigates two different fitness functions - accuracy and area under the curve. The proposed method is investigated on a range of event detection tasks. The investigation starts from synthetic tasks such as detecting complete sine waves. The performance of the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method is compared to traditional classification methods. On the raw data the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method achieves 100 percent accuracy, which outperforms all the non-GP methods. The performance of the non-GP methods is comparable to the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method only with suitable features. In addition, the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method is investigated on two complex real-world event detection tasks - dangerous driving behaviour detection and video shot detection. In the task of detecting three dangerous driving behaviours from 21 -channel time series data, the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method performs consistently better than the non-GP classifiers even when features are provided. In the video shot detection task, the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method achieves comparable performance on 11200 -channel time series to the non-GP classifiers on 28 features. The <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method is more accurate than a commercial product. The <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method has also been investigated on state detection tasks. This involves synthetic tasks such as detecting concurrent high values in four of five channels and a real-world activity recognition problem. The results also show that the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method consistently outperforms the non-GP methods even with the presence of manually constructed features. As part of the investigation, a mobile phone based activity recognition data set was collected as there was no existing publicly available data set. The suitability of the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method for solving real-world problems is further analysed. Our analysis shows that the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method can be successfully extended for multi-class classification. The analysis of the evolved programs demonstrates that they do capture time series patterns. On synthetic data sets, the injected regularities are revealed in understandable individuals. The best programs for three real-world problems are more difficult to explain but still provide some insight. The selection of relevant channels and data points by the programs are consistent with domain knowledge. In addition, the analysis shows that the proposed method still performs well for time series pattern of different sizes. The effective window sizes of the evolved GP programs are close to the pattern size. Finally, our study on execution performance of the evolved programs shows that these programs are fast in execution and are suitable for real-time applications. In summary, the <b>GP</b> <b>based</b> method is suitable for the kinds of real-world applications studied in this thesis. This thesis concludes that, with a suitable representation, genetic programming can be an effective method for event and state detection in multi-channel time series for a range of synthetic and real-world tasks. This method does not require much domain knowledge such as the pattern size and suitable features. It offers an effective classification method in similar tasks that are studied in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} low cost {{remote sensing system}} for use in agricultural applications. The important features of the system are that it monitors the near infrared and it incorporates position and attitude measuring equipment allowing for geo-rectified images to be produced {{without the use of}} ground control points. The equipment is designed to be hand held and hence requires no structural modification to the aircraft. The portable remote sensing system consists of an inertia measurement unit (IMU), which is accelerometer based, a low-cost GPS device and a small format false colour composite digital camera. The total cost of producing such a system is below GBP 3000, which is far cheaper than equivalent existing systems. The design of the portable remote sensing device has eliminated bore sight misalignment errors from the direct geo-referencing process. A new processing technique has been introduced for the data obtained from these low-cost devices, and it is found that using this technique the image can be matched (overlaid) onto Ordnance Survey Master Maps at an accuracy compatible with precision agriculture requirements. The direct geo-referencing has also been improved by introducing an algorithm capable of correcting oblique images directly. This algorithm alters the pixels value, hence it is advised that image analysis is performed before image georectification. The drawback of this research is that the low-cost GPS device experienced bad checksum errors, which resulted in missing data. The Wide Area Augmented System (WAAS) correction could not be employed because the satellites could not be locked onto whilst flying. The best GPS data were obtained from the Garmin eTrex (15 m kinematic and 2 m static) instruments which have a highsensitivity receiver with good lock on capability. The limitation of this GPS device is the inability to effectively receive the P-Code wavelength, which is needed to gain the best accuracy when undertaking differential GPS processing. Pairing the carrier phase L 1 with the pseudorange C/A-Code received, {{in order to determine the}} image coordinates by the differential technique, is still under investigation. To improve the position accuracy, it is recommended that a <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> should be established near the survey area, instead of using a permanent <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> established by the Ordnance Survey.

30|$|For {{measuring}} the absolute elevations at the Sendai Plain using GPS instruments, {{it is noteworthy}} that the adjacent electric reference points (<b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station)</b> were also moved by crustal deformation of the earthquake on March 11, 2011. In fact, the electric measurement point at Yamoto, 30 km northeast from Sendai, was displaced horizontally approx. 4 m eastward and subsided approx. 50 cm. Moreover, they were shut down until April 8, 2011. Therefore, it was necessary to refer the electric reference points that were distant from the affected area, where crustal displacement was minimal. To do so, we set a Proflex 500 as the base site, which can refer to electric points within 500 km, at the roof of the highest building at Tohoku University (approx. 160 m higher than T.P.) and referenced the electric reference points at Matsumae in Hokkaido prefecture and Gotenba in Shizuoka prefecture (approx. 350 km from Sendai) (Fig. 1). At these electric reference points, no significant vertical crustal movement was recorded. Therefore, run-up heights can be measured accurately.|$|E

40|$|In GPS {{satellite}} positioning, {{the satellite}} coordinates require to be continuously updated to obtain coordinates of ground single-point positioning by using determined coordinates and method of backward intersection. Real-time satellite coordinates {{are determined by}} broadcast ephemeris. The broadcast ephemeris forecasts the data every two hours. If the data are used to calculate satellite coordinates, the data would be enormous and calculation is complex. Therefore, this study applied Chebyshev polynomials fitting method to reduce computation process and save data memory space. This study analyzed satellite data from the TC 02 <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> in Taichung City, applied Chebyshev polynomials to fit broadcast ephemeris, and discusses impacts of sampling time and fitting order on 3 D components and precision results of satellite coordinates for ground point-positioning after fitting. In selection of fitting order, this study applied the 12 th order Chebyshev polynomials to fit experimental fitting order, because too many orders may require longer sampling time and cannot be used in calculation of real-time satellite positioning. Thus, the 12 th order was selected to balance sampling time and fitting precision. The fitting {{results showed that the}} fitting precision of 3 D coordinate components is lower than 2 m when using satellite coordinates of Chebyshev polynomials fitting. The satellite coordinates after fitting were used to calculate single-point positioning results of TC 02 <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> Errors of the coordinate components were less than 6 m. The precision of fitting results were 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 m higher than that of satellite coordinates obtained from original equation. These findings can be used to reduce the computation procedure of satellite coordinates needed for GPS satellite single-point positioning. This study can improve the shortcomings in the equations of computing satellite coordinates using broadcast ephemeris to lift the speed of single-point positioning. 在GPS衛星定位中，需不斷的計算及更新衛星坐標，進而利用所得坐標進行地面後方交會法求得地面單點定位坐標。即時的衛星坐標是由廣播星曆計算而得。廣播星曆是以兩小時為間隔的預報資料，如果直接使用於計算衛星坐標，資料龐大且計算繁雜，故本研究加入切比雪夫多項式擬合法以簡化運算流程、減低資料內存空間等。 本研究以分析台中市TC 02 GPS基站所接收之衛星資料為基礎，研究利用切比雪夫(Chebyshev) 多項式擬合廣播星曆，就其採樣時間、擬合階數對衛星坐標三維分量的影響，以及分析擬合後衛星坐標用於地面單點定位之精度成果。 在擬合階數的選定上，本研究採用 12 階切比雪夫多項式擬合為實驗擬合階數，其原因在於過多階數會影響取樣時間過長，導致無法應用於即時衛星定位的計算，故將擬合階數選定在 12 階，以期在取樣時間及擬合精度上取得一個平衡。 根據本研究擬合結果顯示，使用切比雪夫多項式擬合之衛星坐標，其三維坐標分量之擬合精度在± 2 m以下，使用擬合後之衛星坐標用於計算TC 02 GPS基站單點定位成果，各坐標分量的中誤差都在± 6 m以下，其擬合結果較原公式法計算之衛星坐標精度約高出 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 m不等。 本研究成果可應用於簡化目前GPS衛星單點定位所需之衛星坐標計算流程。改善部分利用廣播星曆直接計算衛星坐標公式的缺點，進而提升單點定位之計算速度。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	v 表目錄	vii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究動機與目的	 1 1 - 3 文獻回顧	 2 1 - 4 論文架構	 3 第二章 研究理論基礎	 4 2 - 1 全球定位系統 (Global Positioning System,GPS) 	 4 2 - 1 - 1 GPS系統介紹	 4 2 - 1 - 2 GPS定位基本原理	 6 2 - 1 - 3 GPS之誤差來源	 7 2 - 2 廣播星曆 (Broadcast Ephemeris) 	 9 2 - 3 精密星曆 (Precise Ephemeris) 	 10 2 - 4 衛星軌道擬合	 11 第三章 研究方法與流程	 13 3 - 1 GPS定位測量之基本概念	 13 3 - 2 GPS衛星坐標計算	 13 3 - 3 切比雪夫多項式	 17 3 - 4 單點定位	 18 3 - 5 GPS衛星後方交會法測站坐標計算	 19 3 - 6 研究設計流程	 22 3 - 7 計算程式使用介紹	 25 第四章 研究成果分析	 27 4 - 1 公式計算衛星坐標結果	 27 4 - 2 切比雪夫多項式擬合衛星坐標結果	 29 4 - 2 - 1 切比雪夫多項式擬合階數比較	 30 4 - 2 - 2 12 階切比雪夫多項式擬合結果	 31 4 - 3 以擬合坐標用於單點定位精度分析	 33 第五章 結論與建議	 39 5 - 1 結論	 39 5 - 2 建議	 40 參考文獻	 41 附錄	 4...|$|E

These flight phases include en route, terminal, non-precision approach and precision approach. The thesis includes four major topics: probability problem of GPS navigation service, risk analysis of aircraft precision approach and landing, theoretical analysis of Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) techniques and RAIM availability, and GPS integrity monitoring at a ground reference station. Particular attention is paid to the mathematical aspects of the GPS integrity monitoring system. The research has been built upon the stringent integrity requirements defined by civil aviation community, and concentrates on the capability and performance investigation of practical integrity monitoring systems with rigorous mathematical and statistical concepts and approaches. Major contributions of this research are: • Rigorous integrity and continuity risk analysis for aircraft precision approach. Based on the joint probability density function of the affecting components, the integrity and continuity risks of aircraft precision approach with DGPS were computed. This advanced the conventional method of allocating the risk probability. • A theoretical study of RAIM test power.

This study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the applied technology and techniques. Sixty differentially- corrected GPS positions were calculated at a 1 st order monument located 257 miles from the <b>GPS</b> <b>Base</b> <b>Station.</b> The horizontal mean radial error for these tests was 7. 8 ft.

These tests were conducted under ideal conditions. Traditional surveying is used to determine bearing and distances between wells and associated potential pollution sources. A bearing/distance is then shot to a GPS location that is clear of obstruction. The Geographic Calculator is then used to translate distances and bearing from station to station for positional indices.

40|$|The Vertical Offshore Reference Frame (VORF) is a {{model of}} various {{vertical}} datums as continuous surfaces relative to ETRF 89 that covers all the navigable waters of Great Britain and Ireland. The intended accuracy of the model was to determine the vertical datums of LAT, MLWS, MSL and CD to within 0. 100 m in near-shore areas and 0. 150 m in offshore areas bringing significant advantages to future hydrographic applications. Validation of the model to date has shown that it is fit for purpose under caveats that: advise caution in its use thereby limiting the liability of the UKHO; recommend the model is monitored and updated when new data is available; suggest documentation outlining a suitable method for testing the model is made available. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate a suitable, robust and repeatable methodology for validating the VORF transformation model. A methodology was developed after thorough investigation of vertical reference surfaces, the methods used to create VORF, the tests carried out to date and the available technology. The methodology required performing a harmonic tidal analysis on tidal data collected with a sub-sea pressure gauge positioned relative to ETRF 89. Vertical positioning was achieved by simultaneously recording both the depth of water over the gauge and the height of the water surface from a fixed surface radar gauge. These values were deducted from the ETRF 89 height of the radar gauge which had been established by means of a short levelling connection to a <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> To authenticate this methodology it was implemented at two locations in the SW of England; Polperro and Brixham. This investigation showed that the methodology {{has the potential to be}} used for identifying anomalies in the VORF transformation model; however divergence between the curves observed simultaneously by the two tide gauges rendered the determination of the ellipsoidal height of the sub-sea pressure gauge uncertain and the findings of this dissertation inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{mean square error}} (MSE) uplink/downlink duality for the {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) systems where imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> (BS) and mobile stations (MSs). The channel is modeled by incorporating antenna correlation at the BS. In contrast to the perfect CSI case where instantaneous MSE duality is considered, the average mean square error (AMSE) duality is exploited. To show the application of our AMSE duality we consider the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transceiver design for the downlink multiuser MIMO systems. Our objective is to minimize the sum MSE constrained with a total BS power and provide robustness against channel uncertainties. In the uplink channel, the power allocation part of this problem is formulated as a geometric program (<b>GP).</b> <b>Based</b> on the solution of GP and the AMSE duality analysis, we propose an iterative algorithm that performs optimization alternatively between the uplink and the downlink channels. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is studied. Computer simulations verify the robustness of the proposed design when compared to the non-robust/naive design. Anglai...|$|R

40|$|As of this writing, {{there are}} two popular methods to perform precise {{surveying}} using the single dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. One is the Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) technique. The other is the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique. The RTK technique requires GPS surveyors {{to have at least}} one <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> while the PPP technique needs a long observation period to resolve the carrier-phase ambiguities. This paper proposes a new, fast method that can conduct precise kinematic surveying using a single dual-frequency GPS receiver, overcoming the aforementioned problems. This new method, Absolute Plus Loop-based Accumulated-solution Time-relative (APLAT), combines the GPS absolute-positioning method and a loop-based accumulated-solution time-relative positioning method. In this APLAT method, the kinematic surveying trajectory must form a loop. The coordinates of the start-point of the loop can be precisely determined using the absolute positioning function of APLATby making two short sessions of static observations. This function is useful if no control-point is available in the kinematic surveying. The relative positions of other kinematic surveying points in the loop are determined using the function of loop-based accumulated-solution time-relative GPS positioning. The integration of the absolute and the relative positioning functions allows kinematic surveying to precisely determine the absolute coordinates of each surveyed point in the loop. To determine the absolute coordinates of the start-point of a loop, only two short sessions (5 min each in this study) of static GPS observations (prior to starting and after completing the loop surveying) are required. The results of extensive absolute-positioning tests show that 3 D-positioning standard deviation about 7 cm and root-mean-square (RMS) error about 13. 4 cm can be achieved when the loop-duration is in the range of 40 - 80 min. Too short orlong a loopduration may degrade the absolute-positioning accuracy. Results from various relative positioning tests using the loop-based accumulatedsolution time-relative method indicate that relative-positioning RMS errors of 1. 3 cm, 2. 6 cm, and 8. 8 cm can be obtained for loop durations of 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min, respectively. This new APLAT method offers a new, fast, and precise (RMS error of 12 cm for absolute and RMS error of 8. 8 -cm relative positioning for 60 -min loop duration) kinematic surveying method that is able to meet many GPS surveying and mapping requirements. This is particularly useful for postmission data processing in circumstances where single-base-station RTK or network RTKserviceis not available. In this study, the final precise-orbit and precise-satellite-clock datafrom the InternationalGNSS Service are used to mitigate these errors. At present, this method is useful just for postmission applications, but it offers the flexibility of using absolute-positioning or relative-positioning function only, depending upon the specific surveying and mapping conditions and requirements. This method is a good complement to thePPP and RTKprecise-positioning techniques currently in use. Due to the increasing spatialdecorrelation of error sources, the positioning accuracy may degrade as the maximum spatial distance (approximately between the loop start-point and the loop middle-point) increases.

40|$|When {{the widely}} used survey technique-Global Positioning System (GPS) executes {{the results of}} single point {{positioning}} for calculation, {{it is assumed that}} all data are from normal parent body, and observed values are distributed normally. Based on these hypotheses, the calculation procedure adopts least square method. After collection, calculation and statistical analysis, this study discuss whether residual errors (residuals) of observed values from the six GPS base stations in Taichung for point positioning are distributed normally. The least square method is used to verify correctness and integrity of observed values of GPS in calculation, and select evaluation reference method for selection of satellite and base station for single-point positioning. The observed data are used to support relevant views, hypothesis and suggestions presented in this study. After comparison and analysis, it is found that residual errors of GPS satellite observed values have high accuracy but lower precision, and 40 % of error distribution of GPS observed value is normal. Based on absolute value of mean value, satellite selection may increase precision of GPS single-point positioning. For base station evaluation, this study selects TC 02 base station of National Chung Hsing University. After comparison analysis, location of TC 02 <b>GPS</b> <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is simple, and suitably used as excellent point of base station. 目前廣泛應用之測量技術-全球定位系統(Global Positioning System，簡稱GPS) 其執行單點定位成果解算時，均假設資料來源是來自於常態的母體，觀測值的分布為標準的常態分布。在這些假設下，採用最小二乘法進行解算程序。 本研究經由蒐集、計算及統計分析等步驟，探討台中市所設立之六個GPS基站所接收之觀測數據進行單點定位時，其觀測值之殘差(即改正數) 分布情形是否屬於常態分布。藉以驗證GPS觀測值進入解算程序時，使用最小二乘法原理解算之科學根據的正確性及完整性，並為當前單點定位衛星選星效益及基站選定評估的參考方式，提出與本研究相關的想法、假設及建議並設計相關實驗，並取得觀測資料佐以證明之。 本研究經比較與分析後，可發現GPS衛星觀測值殘差的精確度高，但精密度不高，且GPS觀測值之誤差分布符合常態分布的比例約為 40 %。而經由平均值之絕對值較小選星之方式能些許提升GPS單點定位的精度。在基站評估的方面，本研究選定新設立之TC 02 中興大學基站進行評估，發現TC 02 GPS基站的位置經由比較分析後，是一個適合作為基站的優良點位。誌謝	i 摘要	iii ABSTRACT	iv 目錄	v 表目錄	vii 圖目錄	ix 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究動機與目的	 1 1 - 2 - 1 研究動機	 1 1 - 2 - 2 研究目的	 2 1 - 3 文獻回顧	 3 1 - 3 - 1 GPS觀測數據的統計測試	 3 1 - 3 - 2 以直方圖表述誤差分布	 3 1 - 3 - 3 近年文獻對誤差分布形式的質疑	 3 1 - 3 - 4 衛星選星效益分析	 6 1 - 4 研究架構與流程	 7 1 - 5 論文架構	 9 第二章 理論基礎	 10 2 - 1 GPS衛星定位測量	 10 2 - 1 - 1 GPS定位原理	 10 2 - 1 - 2 GPS觀測量	 10 2 - 1 - 3 GPS誤差來源	 12 2 - 2 廣義最小二乘法原理	 15 2 - 2 - 1 廣義最小二乘法基本公式	 15 2 - 3 GPS衛星後方交會法測站計算	 16 2 - 4 常態分布	 17 2 - 4 - 1 常態分布的公式	 17 2 - 4 - 2 常態分布的特徵	 17 2 - 5 精度評估	 18 2 - 6 卡方適合度檢定	 19 2 - 6 - 1 卡方適合度檢定的公式	 19 第三章 研究方法	 21 3 - 1 研究區選定	 21 3 - 2 程式介紹	 23 3 - 3 精度評估	 25 3 - 4 統計檢定	 25 3 - 5 研究流程	 26 3 - 5 - 1 主研究	 26 3 - 5 - 2 附加研究	 29 第四章 研究成果與分析	 31 4 - 1 主研究成果分析	 31 4 - 1 - 1 各基站單點定位成果	 31 4 - 1 - 2 衛星偽距值殘差分析	 33 4 - 1 - 3 卡方適合度檢定	 36 4 - 2 附加研究成果與分析	 42 4 - 2 - 1 衛星選星效益評估	 42 4 - 2 - 2 基站評估效益分析	 45 第五章 結論與建議	 47 5 - 1 結論	 47 5 - 2 建議	 48 參考文獻	 49 附錄一 各小時單點定位解算表	 51 附錄二 各衛星偽距改正值表	 63 附錄三 卡方適合度檢定表	 69 附錄四 衛星選星效益時段挑選比較表	 7...|$|E
