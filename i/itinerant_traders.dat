5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who {{had to resort to}} peddling were to be exempted from taxation.|$|E
5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E

30|$|According to Skinner (2008) and Peberdy (2016), a {{major factor}} that swells the number of <b>itinerant</b> street <b>traders</b> in sub-Saharan Africa is {{international}} migration. As Landau (2007) points out, international migration is an inexorable response to regional economic inequalities. Itinerant trading is thus what many foreign immigrants opt to do at their destinations. Lonreco-Lindell (2004) for example cites {{the case of the}} Dyulas-itinerant traders who have been active in West Africa for centuries, moving goods across borders. For many villages, <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>traders</b> are the primary source of supplies (Skinner, 2008). Peberdy’s (2016) study, one of the few surveys on cross border traders in Southern Africa, suggested that <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>traders</b> either supply domestic street traders or sell their wares directly.|$|R

As an Irishman and a Catholic, he was able to emigrate legally to Spanish America in 1756. Once there, and for some time, he was an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> in Venezuela, New Granada, and Peru, but, being investigated by the Inquisition, he moved to La Plata Colony, in present-day Argentina, where he tried some commercial ventures. From there, O'Higgins proposed to open easy communication between Chile and Mendoza by a way over the Andes, and, his proposition being accepted, he was employed to supervise the project.|$|R
25|$|Although {{primarily}} subsistence farmers, the Akha {{have long}} been involved in cash cropping and trade. In the last century, cotton and opium poppies were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. <b>Itinerant</b> <b>traders,</b> either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.|$|E
25|$|Wanting to {{stabilize}} {{and develop the}} frontier, Mexico encouraged immigration into present-day Texas, as {{they were unable to}} persuade people from central Mexico to move into those areas. They allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers, who were primarily Protestant English speakers from the United States. Within several years, the Anglos far outnumbered the Tejano in the area. <b>Itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> traveled through the area, working by free market principles. The Tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect, many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end, collaborating with the English-speaking Americans.|$|E
25|$|Without {{adequate}} roads, {{the regions}} of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, {{and the majority of}} the population living at a subsistence level. In the Cibao Valley, the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the development of}} the retail sector in eighteenth-century provincial England, with particular reference to Hamsphire. The move to fixed place retailing is set against a background of changing wholesale and domestic distribution techniques and the significant demographic shifts experienced at the time. The role of the market, fair, and <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> are considered against the rise of the increasingly specialist resident retailer. Innovations in retail practice (fixed pricing, advertising, loss leaders, the promotion of cash, the tightening of credit and the introduction of branded goods) are examined, collectively indicating that retail distribution underwent a significant transformation in the late eighteenth century. ...|$|R

She moved to South Africa in 1878, hoping to become a farmer, but she discovered {{that she had been}} cheated in her arrangements, and took a position as a governess for two years instead. With her earnings she bought a cart and oxen, and had some success as an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader,</b> which she wrote about in another book, A Lady Trader in the Transvaal (1882).

500|$|By this time, {{a row of}} stalls {{bordering}} on St Peter Mancroft's churchyard had developed into a row of three and four-storey houses running east to west, and a second row of buildings running north to south ran through the main market square. This row of houses cut off the main market from the eastern strip housing the butchers and fishmongers, known as the Upper Market, leaving only two narrow passageways as direct links between the two-halves of the market square. (Although the buildings dividing {{the upper and lower}} markets were demolished in the 1930s, one of these connecting passages survives as Pudding Lane. The name [...] "Pudding Lane" [...] derives from [...] "ped", an archaic word for the large baskets from which <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> sold goods in the market.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Pagoda festivals ( [...] Paya pwè) held {{throughout}} the country also usually fall on full moon days {{and most of them}} will be on the full moon of Tabaung (February/March) including the Shwedagon Pagoda. They attract not only crowds of pilgrims from near and far, often in caravans of bullock carts, but they also double as great market fairs where both local and <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> set up their stalls and shops among food stalls, restaurants, and free open-air stage performances as well as theatre halls.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{different}} types of merchants who operated in the ancient Tamil market, which {{gave rise to a}} wealth-based class distinction among them. Merchants in the lower levels of the hierarchy were of two varieties: the [...] merchants who sold goods that they manufactured themselves and the retailers who sold goods manufactured by others. <b>Itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> were found in both the rural and urban markets, but the retailers were concentrated in the cities. In the rural markets, salt and grain merchants usually produced the goods, transported them and sold them directly to the consumers. Salt merchants, known as umanar, travelled with their families in trains of carts. In the cities, artisans such as the blacksmiths and the oil mongers sold their products directly to the consumers. The bulk of the retailers operated in the textile industry. The textile dealers (aruvai vanigar) bought their products from the weavers (kaarugar) and resold them to the consumers. Merchants selling agricultural produce in the cities were also retailers. At {{the upper end of the}} merchant hierarchy, were the rich merchants who participated in the export trade. There were three classes among them - ippar, kavippar and perunkudi - based on the extent of their wealth; the perunkudi made up the wealthiest class. Foreign merchants, mainly Romans, also did business in the Tamil markets [...] not just in the port cities, but in inland cities such as Madurai, where they exchanged indigenous goods for their offerings. Another category of merchants were the intermediaries or the brokers, who acted as information channels and offered their services mainly to the foreign merchants.|$|E

After being rebuilt in the 1950s, the figure of the <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> was replaced by Jeff Koons in 1987 for the decennial Skulptur Projekte exhibition. Standing on a central square in Münster, the statue retained a certain cultural power as a nostalgic symbol of the past. During the production process, the foundry where the piece was being made wanted to knock the ceramic shell off too soon, which resulted in the piece being bent and deformed.

5000|$|Because of {{the great}} numbers of people {{attracted}} by fairs they were often the scenes of riots and disturbances, so the privilege of holding a fair was granted by royal charter. At first, they were allowed only in towns and places of strength, or {{where there was a}} bishop, sheriff or governor who could keep order. In time various benefits became attached to certain fairs, such as granting people the protection of a holiday and allowing them freedom from arrest in certain circumstances. The officials were authorized to mete out justice to those who came to their fair; eventually even the smallest fair would have had a court to adjudicate on offences and disputes arising within the fairground, called a pye powder court (from Old French pieds pouldrés, literally [...] "dusty feet", meaning an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader,</b> from Medieval Latin pedes pulverosi).|$|R
60|$|The worthy clavero, Don Gutiere de Padilla, was pondering one day on this gloomy {{state of}} affairs when a Moor was brought before him who had {{surrendered}} himself at the gate of Alhama and claimed an audience.

He had a box strapped to his shoulders containing divers articles of traffic, {{and appeared to be}} one of those <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> who often resorted to Alhama and the other garrison towns under pretext of vending trivial merchandise, such as amulets, perfumes, and trinkets, but who often produced rich shawls, golden chains and necklaces, and valuable gems and jewels.|$|E
60|$|AFTER {{taking the}} bath on his arrival at Damascus, having his beard {{arranged}} by a barber of distinction, and dressing {{himself in a}} fresh white suit, as was his custom when in residence, with his turban of the same colour arranged a little aside, for Baroni was scrupulous as to his appearance, he hired a donkey {{and made his way}} to the great bazaar. The part of the city through which he proceeded was very crowded and bustling: narrow streets, with mats slung across, to shield from the sun the swarming population beneath. His accustomed step was familiar with every winding of the emporium of the city; he threaded without hesitation the complicated mazes of those interminable arcades. Now he was in the street of the armourers, now among the sellers of shawls; the prints of Manchester were here unfolded, there the silks of India; sometimes he sauntered by a range of shops gay with yellow papooshes and scarlet slippers, and then hurried by the stalls and shelves stored with the fatal frippery of the East, in which it is said the plague in some shape or other always lurks and lingers. This locality, however, indicated that Baroni was already approaching the purlieus of the chief places; the great population had already much diminished, the brilliancy of the scene much dimmed; there was no longer the swarm of <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> who live by promptly satisfying the wants of the visitors to the bazaar in the shape of a pipe or an ice, a cup of sherbet or of coffee, or a basket of delicious fruit. The passengers were few, and all seemed busy: some Armenians, a Hebrew physician and his page, the gliding phantoms of some winding-sheets, which were in fact women.|$|E

The distance to this spot was great; the path led through a thousand dangers, and the result was far from certain. Yet it quickened hopes which had long been dormant. Ruth never urged any request that might involve serious hazard to her husband, and for many months the latter had even ceased to speak on the subject. Still, nature was working powerfully within him.

Meanwhile, Ghana as one of the main economic hubs of West Africa hosts a significant number of these immigrants who predominantly subsist in itinerant petty trading across the country (Bakewell & Jόnsson, 2011; GSS 2013).

30|$|The study {{analysed}} the livelihood {{activities of}} itinerant West African migrant traders who were {{permanent residents in}} the AMA of Ghana. Based on the major findings, the following conclusions and implications are drawn. The immigrants were generally young unmarried males from Niger {{and the majority of}} them were without formal education (Table 1). The dominant trading activity undertaken among the immigrants was itinerant vending of foot wears/leather belts/bags. Significant variations were found between the immigrants’ background characteristics and their livelihood status (Table 3). Nevertheless, male <b>itinerant</b> immigrant <b>traders</b> and those who were older including those involved in the sale of electronics and accessories {{were more likely to have}} improved livelihood status. The study concludes that although itinerant trading in the AMA offered an opportunity for many <b>itinerant</b> immigrant <b>traders</b> to earn a living and reduce their socio-economic vulnerabilities, it was found that young females and those who were engaged in the sale of food-related items were less likely to achieve improved livelihood status (Table 3) perhaps due to excessive and unfair competition from their male counterparts and the risk usually associated with the marketing of food items.|$|R

Lee published many other works including Unanticipated Meeting (Giu), Shattered Red Lantern (Kkaetteuryeojineun hongdeung) and At Sea Near Russia (Noryeong geunhae), all of which reflected his socialist sympathies. Lee's work was self-consciously political and frequently focused {{on the lives of}} unfortunate women forced into prostitution, often combining his political message with explorations of sexuality. [...] In 1933, however, coincident with increased pressure from Japanese occupiers that literature not be political Lee helped found the Group of Nine (Guin hoe), and abandoned political literature in favor of more aesthetic approaches. [...] The Group of Nine included Jung Jiyong, Yi Sang, Kim Girim, Lee Taejun all of whom influenced Lee. Lee continued to be concerned with eroticism, but his focus also turned largely to nature. In his story Pig, Lee writes of a man who raises a sow, with the intent of building a pig farm, but superimposes human sexuality over the rutting of the pigs. In Bunnyeo, Lee explored a sexually wanton character.
