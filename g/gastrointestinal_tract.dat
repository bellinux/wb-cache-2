5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract</b> from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract</b> and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E

Neither anthelmintic significantly affected average daily gain or feed efficiency. Pigs fed Banminth continuously were 5 % more efficient in feed utilization during the starter phase and 4 % more efficient in feed utilization during the grower phase than nonwormed pigs. Pigs fed Banminth had no liver scarring and no ascarids in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> at 125 pounds.

50|$|Lithiasis ({{formation}} of stones) is {{a global}} human health problem. Stones can form in both urinary and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tracts.</b> Related {{to the formation of}} stones is the formation of crystals; this can occur in joints (e.g. gout) and in the viscera.|$|R
5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract.</b> Increased peripheral use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{can also}} be used before surgery in certain cases. When {{pre-operative}} imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a total hysterectomy is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT {{can also be}} used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy.

5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract</b> and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tract</b> is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} a pigeon rotavirus, PO- 13, but not turkey strains Ty- 3 and Ty- 1 and a chicken strain, Ch- 1, induced diarrhea in heterologous suckling mice. In this study, {{it was suggested}} that these avirulent strains, but not PO- 13, were inactivated immediately in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of suckling mice when they were orally inoculated. To determine which viral proteins contribute to the differences between the pathogenicitiy and the inactivation of PO- 13 and Ty- 3 in suckling mice, six PO- 13 × Ty- 3 reassortant strains that had the genes of the outer capsid proteins, VP 4 and VP 7, derived from the opposite strain were prepared and were orally inoculated to suckling mice. A single strain that had both PO- 13 VP 4 and VP 7 with the genetic background of Ty- 3 had an intermediate virulence for suckling mice. Three strains with Ty- 3 VP 7, regardless of the origin of VP 4, rapidly disappeared from <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of suckling mice. These results indicated that the difference between the pathogenicity of PO- 13 and that of Ty- 3 was mainly dependent on both their VP 4 and VP 7. In particular, VP 7 was found {{to be related to the}} inactivation of Ty- 3 in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>tracts</b> of suckling mice...|$|R
