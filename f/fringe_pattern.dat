5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the <b>fringe</b> <b>pattern,</b> one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation <b>fringe</b> <b>pattern,</b> where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall <b>fringe</b> <b>pattern.</b> [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E

[...] Use of partially monochromatic light (yellow sodium light) during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length, more or less easily, before switching to white light.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{challenge}} for Phase Measurement Profilometry (PMP) to measure objects with a large range of reflectivity variation across the surface. Saturated or dark pixels in the deformed <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> captured by the camera will lead to phase fluctuations and errors. Jiang et al. proposed a high dynamic range real-time 3 D shape measurement method without changing camera exposures. Three inverted phase-shifted <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are used to complement three regular phase-shifted <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> for phase retrieval when any of the regular <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are saturated. But Jiang's method still has some drawbacks: (1) The phases in saturated pixels are respectively estimated by different formulas for different cases. It is shortage of an universal formula; (2) it cannot be extended to four-step phase-shifting algorithm because inverted <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are the repetition of regular fringe patterns; (3) only three unsaturated intensity values at every pixel of <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are chosen for phase demodulation, lying idle the other unsaturated ones. We proposed a method for enhanced high dynamic range 3 D shape measurement based on generalized phase-shifting algorithm, which combines the complementary technique of inverted and regular <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> with generalized phase-shifting algorithm. Firstly, two sets of complementary phase-shifted <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns,</b> namely regular and inverted <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are projected and collected. Then all unsaturated intensity values at the same camera pixel from two sets of <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are selected, and employed to retrieve the phase by generalized phase-shifting algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to prove {{the validity of the}} proposed method. The results are analyzed and compared with Jiang's method, which demonstrate that the proposed method not only expands the scope of Jiang's method, but also improves the measurement accuracy.

Due {{to the low}} contrast of the cardiac surface, the projector and the camera must remain focused, which poses challenges for any existing binary method where the measurement accuracy is low. To conquer this challenge, this paper proposes to utilize the optimal pulse width modulation (OPWM) technique to generate high-frequency <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the error-diffusion dithering technique to produce low-frequency <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns.</b> Furthermore, this paper will show that <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> produced with blue light provide the best quality measurements compared to <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> generated with red or green light; and the minimum data acquisition speed for high quality measurements is around 800 Hz for a rabbit heart beating at 180 beats per minute...|$|R
2500|$|This {{expression}} applies {{when the}} light source has a single wavelength, whereas Young used sunlight, and was therefore looking at white-light fringes which he describes above. [...] A white light <b>fringe</b> <b>pattern</b> can {{be considered to be}} made up of a set of individual fringe patterns of different colours. [...] These all have a maximum value in the centre, but their spacing varies with wavelength, and the superimposed patterns will vary in colour, as their maxima will occur in different places. Only two or three fringes can normally be observed. Young used this formula to estimate the wavelength of violet light to be 400nbsp&nm, and that of red light to be about twice that – results with which we would agree today.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{published}} work, {{we proposed a}} technique to recover the absolute phase maps of <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> with two selected fringe wavelengths. To achieve higher anti-error capability, the proposed method requires employing the <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> with longer wavelengths; however, longer wavelength {{may lead to the}} degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the surface measurement. In this paper, we propose a new approach to unwrap the phase maps from their wrapped versions based on the use of fringes with three different wavelengths which is characterized by improved anti-error capability and SNR. Therefore, while the previous method works on the two-phase maps obtained from six-step phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) (thus 12 <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are needed), the proposed technique performs very well on three-phase maps from three steps PSP, requiring only nine <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> and hence more efficient. Moreover, the advantages of the two-wavelength method in simple implementation and flexibility in the use of <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> are also reserved.

This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} results of an attempt to simulate the Electronic Speckle <b>Pattern</b> Interferometric <b>fringe</b> <b>patterns</b> observed around a crack or combination of cracks in a pressure vessel by finite element methods. Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) is a coherent optical measurement technique that produces a contour map of the surface displacement of an object when it is stressed.
