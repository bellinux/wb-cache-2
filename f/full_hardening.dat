40|$|The As-quenched {{hardness}} behaviour of 1. 2 % {{carbon steels}} in different quenching media was investigated. The hardness values were studied on two grades of {{high carbon steel}} materials, namely 1. 2 % carbon and low-alloy 1. 2 % carbon steels respectively. Specimens were prepared and given both spheroidizing and normalizing heat treatments before they were hardened. Hardening was done at both 800 oC and 850 oC and quenching {{was carried out in}} water, cold water, brine, cold brine and SAE engine oil. Then hardness measurements were carried out on the specimens in the pre-hardening and as-quenched conditions, results obtained showed that in the as-quenched condition, oil quenching resulted in partial hardening in both steels; the addition of 1. 2 % tungsten to the 1. 2 % carbon steel was not sufficient to cause <b>full</b> <b>hardening.</b> <b>Full</b> <b>hardening</b> was only attained when quenched in water or brine. Cold brine quenching produced maximum as-quenched hardness values in both steels; in conclusion, higher as-quenched hardness values were obtained for the case of normalized prehardening structure than the other case of spheroidized pre-hardening structure when quenched from 800 oC, it is the reverse when they were quenched from 850 oC. The two steels did not attain <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> when quenched from 800 oC or 850 oC in SAE engine oil. Quenching in more severe media such as water and brine was found to result in adequate hardening, where hardness values of over 600 VHN were obtained...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{hardness}} response of vacuum heat treated (VHT) M 35 HSS {{as a function of}} the thickness of oxide present during VHT. An almost linear relationship existed between the hardening response post-VHT and the oxide thickness pre-VHT. A similar relationship existed between the thickness of oxide pre-VHT and the carbon content post-VHT. CO evolution during VHT was observed from similar to 800 degrees C. In combination, these measurements show that CO evolution and carbon loss are increased in M 35 HSS covered with surface oxide whilst hardening response is reduced. A <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> response and unchanged carbon content were measured in M 35 HSS VHT with surface oxide removed...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of hard ceramic coatings has significantly improved {{the performance of}} high speed steel (HSS) cutting tools. However, failure mechanisms such as plastic deformation of the HSS substrate (beneath a ceramic coating) remain and motivate further research into vacuum heat treatment (VHT). This thesis describes investigations into the hardening response and carbon content of HSS before and after VHT. Poor hardening response of HSS was found to correlate {{with a loss of}} carbon in VHT. <b>Full</b> <b>hardening</b> response was achievable by removing surface oxide scale (predominantly Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) prior to VHT. Further investigation revealed an almost linear relationship between the surface oxide thickness pre-VHT and the post-VHT carbon content and hardening response. With surface oxide present, CO evolution and sample mass loss were observed during VHT of HSS above ~ 800 ℃. With the surface oxide removed, <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> response was achieved and there was no measurable loss in carbon content post-VHT To exploit the fully hardened HSS in a coated tool, plasma nitriding followed by steered cathodic arc evaporation TiAlN ceramic coating process was performed (with no break in vacuum) in an industrial scale deposition chamber. Bright plasma nitriding at ~ 480 ℃ resulted in a fracture tough diffusion zone with no evidence of a compound layer or grain boundary precipitation. M 2 HSS coupons and M 2 &frac 14;-inch jobber drills were similarly tested microstructurally and mechanically in untreated, plasma-nitrided, coated-only and duplex. The &frac 14;-inch jobber drills were subjected to accelerated drill testing into D 2 tool steel which revealed a significant increase in cutting performance of the duplex treatment compared with un-treated tools. Electron microscopy of the sectioned tools indicated that this improved performance was due to increased toughness of the cutting edge coupled with an increase in adhesion at the substrate-TiAlN coating interface...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-high {{strength}} steel (UHSS) {{has become}} a common material in the automotive industry during the last decades. The technique of press hardening allows modifying and tailoring the material properties of the blank in accordance with desired performance. In the present work, a laboratory scale test component is developed. On basis of tests on the component {{it is intended to}} investigate the deformation and fracture behavior of a boron alloyed steel after different heat treatments. The tooling is developed to allow the production of single phase microstructures like martensite and bainite as well as mixed microstructures containing ferrite. Testing of the component is performed in a standard tensile testing machine with additional digital speckle measurements to determine the strain to fracture in the critical cross section. The initial geometry shape introduces bending in the critical cross-section during tensile loading of the specimen. The aim of this work is to compare different material models on a component like level, including the prediction of failure. A finite element model of a laboratory scale component is analyzed using LS-Dyna. To compare different failure modeling approaches a set of damage models is calibrated to <b>full</b> <b>hardened,</b> martensitic steel. The deformation and fracture behavior of the component is presented in terms of load-displacement, plastic strain-stress triaxiality as well as in principal strain space...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFormability of {{automotive}} friction stir welded TWB (tailor-welded blank) sheets was experimentally and numerically investigated {{in this work}} for four automotive sheets, aluminum alloy 6111 -T 4, 5083 -H 18, 5083 -O and DP 590 steel sheets, each having one or two different thicknesses. In particular, formability in three applications including the simple tension test with various weld line directions, hemisphere dome stretching and cylindrical cup drawing tests was evaluated. For numerical simulations, mechanical properties previously characterized in a joint paper (Chung et al., 2010) were utilized. To represent the mechanical properties, the non-quadratic orthogonal anisotropic yield function, Yld 2000 - 2 d, was utilized along with the (<b>full)</b> isotropic <b>hardening</b> law, while the anisotropy of the weld zone was ignored for simplicity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{techniques}} of stress measurement or stress monitoring {{are based on}} the principle of gluing a strain-measurement device on the wall of a pilot hole using an epoxy resin. The curing time needed for this epoxy glue to achieve <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> is rarely put into questions. Here, we present an in situ study of the impact of curing time on the quality of overcoring stress measurements using CSIRO Hi cells. The tests were conducted in an argillite rock at a temperature of 12 °C. We show that the conventional curing time (16 hours) is clearly insufficient in this context and leads to anomalous response in strain readings during both overcoring and biaxial tests, thus hindering stress determination. We claim that in low-temperature near-surface environments, much longer curing times may be needed in order to ensure good quality of stress measurements. Other possible strategies are discussed in the body of this paper...|$|E

It is laid on to the surface, being cut out before, during or after placing, such that {{the edge of the}} surface slightly projects beyond the edge of the cut sheet. The residue (11) is taken away, before, during or after placing, in an automatic process. Also claimed is the corresponding equipment, to carry out the proposed procedure. USE - Used to apply a sheet to a surface, especially a painted vehicular surface, for protection, replacing earlier methods of e. g. wax protection. ADVANTAGE - This process may be fully automated and the protected surface is formed easily and at small cost, and subsequently there is no difficulty in handling since there are no projecting sheet edges to cause problems. Applied to bonnet, boot and doors, all these can be opened afterwards without hindrance, allowing checking, and if necessary, rectification.

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} influences {{structure and}} characteristics of treatmented material. Good heat treatment of steels for bearings ensures hardness of matrix 60 - 65 HRC, whereas structure has be formed by tempered fine needle-shaped martensite with definite part of residual austenite. Carbides should be evenly dispersed, they mustn´t create carbide network and carbide lines. Quality of steels for bearings is also influenced by volume and morphology of inclusions in the matrix. In this diploma thesis various conditions of heat treatment were {{to be set up}} with the aim of choose the optimal ones. These ensures perfect martensite transformation and <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> of all component. Quenching from 760 °C – 770 °C was quite unsatisfactory. At this temperature resulting structure was ferritic-perlitic, because martensite transformation did not pass. Too long hold on hardening temperature also had unfavourable influence on resulting structure and characteristics. In this case, structure was created by very coarse needle-shaped martensite. Coarsening of martensite needle locally exceeded maximum allowed level. In the structure there was also possible to watch partly soluted globular carbides. Optimal heat treatment is quenching from 850 °C – 870 °C followed by tempering at 220 °C. Resulting structure quite agree with above-mentioned needs. This heat treatment can be recommended for technical practise...|$|E

The parameters of the formula can be easily and directly obtained through linear regression analysis. The fitting curves and test results were identified to have excellent agreement for all the six steels.|$|R

It examines {{the applicability of the}} basic approach employed for cold-reduced sheet steel bolted connections, which makes use of the so-called active shear planes, to hot-rolled steel plate connections. The active shear planes lie midway between the gross and the net shear planes defined in the steel structures specifications.

40|$|AbstractIn many cases, powder {{metallurgical}} {{components are}} heat treated {{in order to}} improve the component behavior. An established heat treatment technique for wrought materials is case-hardening. But up to now, this procedure is not applied for powder metallurgical components, since the existing porous microstructure avoids adjusting a defined carbon depth profile. As a consequence a carbonization of the core and a <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> can occur, leading to a disadvantageous phase and residual stress distribution. However, a new approach for case hardening of powder metallurgical components is to perform a surface densification prior to the heat treatment. In this study this approach is realized by using a deep rolling process. In order to verify the functionality of the process chain, the surface integrity was analyzed after each processing step using X-ray diffraction measurements and materialographic methods. There is clear evidence that the open porous structure could be transferred into a surface densified graded porous layer. As a consequence the carburization is dominated by solid state diffusion enabling to adjust a defined carbon depth profile leading to a martensitic surface layer and compressive residual stresses in the near surface zone. Subsequent fatigue strength experiments for sintered samples as well as for additional densified or densified plus case-hardened specimens were performed in order to demonstrate the enhanced mechanical properties. A significant increase in fatigue strength can be measured...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of carbon}} and alloy steels with various carbon contents {{before and after}} the gradient hardening by means of highly concentrated plasma jet have been investigated. It is shown that the resulting structure after the surface hardening has a substantially smaller grain size as compared to the bulk hardening. The steels with different carbon content, that is hypoeutectic steels 45 and 50 HN, eutectic steels – M 76, U 8, hypereutectoid steels – 90 HF, U 10 have been researched. Processing was carried out under the optimal conditions to ensure the highest hardness of the surface without melting. Metalgraphical studies were carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopes. High-dispersed martensite is the main structural component for hypoeutectic steels. Despite the fact that the heating temperature and the cooling rate {{in different parts of the}} plasma exposure zone differ greatly, the structure of the tempered zone is uniform by both the degree of dispersion and by the values of hardness. Plasma treatment of eutectic steels results in fine-grained structure of martensite of mainly lamellar morphology. High-dispersed martensite with microparticles of secondary carbides is characteristic of the hardened zones for hypereutectic steels. But austenite grains do not grow at heating as it usually happens in bulk hardening. The structure of the transition zone corresponds to part-hardened steels. So excess ferrite as well as martensite retains in hypoeutectic steels while excess cementite retains in hypereutectic steels. Eutectic steels are free from the intercritical interval, and the transition zone does not practically develop, there being a very sharp boundary between the zone of <b>full</b> <b>hardening</b> and the parent metal. Due to this structure of the plasma hardening zone of the surface layer there arises 3, 5 [...] . 4, 5 -fold increase in the hardness of the steel as compared with the normalized condition. This is due to the increase in the degree of saturation of the solid solution with alloying elements and carbon, and size-reduction of the hardened structur...|$|E

40|$|Ferritic–martensitic {{dual phase}} (DP) steels deform {{spatially}} {{in a highly}} heterogeneous manner, i. e. with strong strain and stress partitioning at the micro-scale. Such heterogeneity in local strain evolution leads in turn to a spatially heterogeneous damage distribution, and thus, {{plays an important role}} in the process of damage inheritance and fracture. To understand and improve DP steels, it is important to identify connections between the observed strain and damage heterogeneity and the underlying microstructural parameters, e. g. ferrite grain size, martensite distribution, martensite fraction, etc. In this work we pursue this aim by conducting in-situ deformation experiments on two different DP steel grades, employing two different microscopic-digital image correlation (µDIC) techniques to achieve microstructural strain maps of representative statistics and high-resolution. The resulting local strain maps are analyzed in connection to the observed damage incidents (identified by image post-processing) and to local stress maps (obtained from crystal plasticity (CP) simulations of the same microstructural area). The results reveal that plasticity is typically initiated within 2 ̆ 2 hot zones 2 ̆ 2 with larger ferritic grains and lower local martensite fraction. With increasing global deformation, damage incidents are most often observed in the boundary of such highly plastified zones. High-resolution µDIC and the corresponding CP simulations reveal the importance of martensite dispersion: zones with bulky martensite are more susceptible to macroscopic localization before the <b>full</b> strain <b>hardening</b> capacity of the material is consumed. Overall, the presented joint analysis establishes an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach for designing advanced DP steels...|$|R

Test results of all the six types of steels show a three-stage strain hardening behavior. The proposed formula can describe such behavior accurately in the full range using a single expression.

Furthermore, other formulas such as Ludwigson formula, Gardner formula, UGent formula are also applied for comparison. Finally, the proposed formula is considered to have wide suitability and high accuracy for all the steels tested.|$|R

The laboratory test results were obtained by independent researchers for specimens where the applied loads were resisted by the 2 ̆ 2 block 2 ̆ 2 in shear only.
