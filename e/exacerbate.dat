5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to <b>exacerbate</b> Western disunity.|$|E

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to <b>exacerbate</b> the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did not wish to <b>exacerbate.</b> Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and <b>exacerbate</b> future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E

Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could <b>exacerbate</b> a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless {{situation}} – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would not {{speak to each other}} for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or <b>exacerbate</b> respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E

5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased stormwater runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to <b>exacerbate</b> the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can <b>exacerbate</b> sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
5|$|Those {{parts of}} the {{memorandum}} that demanded Lithuanian autonomy and protested the possible attachment of Suwałki Governorate to autonomous Poland were reprinted in the Russian publication Pravitel'stvennyi Vestnik on November 23 (November 10 O.S.). The Russian government sought to demonstrate that granting autonomy to both Poland and Lithuania would be complicated, and would probably <b>exacerbate</b> national conflicts. On November 26 (November 13 O.S.) the memorandum was also reprinted in Vilniaus žinios. It was heavily criticized by non-Lithuanians for its position on minorities and by Lithuanians for making demands {{on behalf of the}} Lithuanian nation without waiting for the Seimas' resolutions.|$|E

5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or <b>exacerbate</b> the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can <b>exacerbate</b> conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might <b>exacerbate</b> the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
