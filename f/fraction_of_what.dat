In comparison, our algorithm is provable, generally applicable, and achieves the desired speedup. The paper ends {{with a discussion of}} possible extensions that generalize the divide-and-conquer theme. We describe two variations that incorporate a multi-stage algorithm. In the first variation, the ordinary PageRank vector is computed. In the second variation, the algorithm computes a generalized version of PageRank where webpages are divided into several classes, each incorporating a different personalization vector. The latter represents a major modeling extension and introduces greater flexibility and a potentially more refined model for web traffic...|$|R

However, his self-imposed exile was not to his liking. He decided to return to the East Coast and try his luck once more at his illicit craft, for which he always found an eager buyer—eventually. In Washington DC, de Hory began an ill-fated association with a picture dealer that ended in disaster. In 1959, suffering from depression, he attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping pills.
