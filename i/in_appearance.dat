5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> to A.serialis, but {{the latter has}} larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm).

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar <b>in</b> <b>appearance,</b> {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{striking}} differences <b>in</b> <b>appearance,</b> S.parthenopion may be {{most closely}} related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
