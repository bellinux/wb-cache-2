If these or any other <b>hydantoin</b> derivatives are used, then cardiac monitoring is a must if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15–30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often coadministered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway.|$|E
25|$|Several {{anticonvulsants}} {{are known}} to be highly teratogenic. Phenytoin, also known as diphenylhydantoin, along with carbamazepine is responsible for the fetal <b>hydantoin</b> syndrome, which may typically include broad nose base, cleft lip and/or palate, microcephalia, nails and fingers hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction and mental retardation. Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has anti-folate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as spina bifida. Lower IQ and autism have recently also been reported as a result of intrauterine valproate exposure.|$|E

25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic <b>hydantoin</b> analog of flutamide, as seen {{in figure}} 5. Nilutamide is {{eliminated}} exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydantoin</b> {{derivative}} dantrolene is a spasmolytic {{agent with}} a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fiber. In normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. Dantrolene interferes {{with the release of}} calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of dantrolene include general muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.|$|E

DNA fragments containing the genes involved in this conversion were cloned from pHN 671 in Escherichia coli by using pUC 18 as a cloning vector. The smaDlest recombinant plasmid, designated pHPB 12, contained a 7. 5 -kb insert DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the insert DNA was determined, and three closely spaced open reading frames predicted to encode peptides with molecular masses of 75. 6, 64. 9, and 45. 7 kDa were found. These open reading frames were designated hyuA, hyuB, and hyuC, respectively. Cell extracts from E. coli carrying deletion derivatives of pHPB 12 were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gene products of hyuA, hyuB, and hyuC were identified. The functions of these gene products were also examined with the deletion derivatives. The results indicate that both hyuA and hyuB are involved in the conversions of D- and L- 5 -substituted <b>hydantoins</b> to corresponding N-carbamyl-D- and N-carbamyl-L-amino acids, respectively, and that hyuC is involved in the conversion of N-carbamyl-L-amino acids to L-amino acids.
