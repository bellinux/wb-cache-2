5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, {{has argued that the}} lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E
5|$|Forward Unto Dawn {{received}} a Streamy Award {{and several of}} the crew {{received a}}wards for their work editing, producing and filming of it. The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing. Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act, but found that the plot was too slow in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> most of the characters were under-developed. The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray faced Bologna in the competition's third round. The {{first game}} was played at Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, which ended in a 1–1 draw; the Italian side took the lead after a Giuseppe Signori goal during the second half, before Hakan Şükür {{levelled}} the score, with eight minutes remaining. At home, the Turkish side scored twice during the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> conceded once, as they won the match 2–1, and the overall leg 3–2. Galatasaray were pitted against Borussia Dortmund in the fourth round. Gala won 2–0 away at Westfalenstadion, while a scoreless draw in the homecoming match was enough for Galatasaray to see them through.|$|E

Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
5|$|Houston's win {{clinched}} the team's first postseason berth in franchise history. The Astros lost the five-game NLCS to the Phillies 3–2, ending their season.

The Dodgers won the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> the Astros the second and so met in the first National League Division Series. The Dodgers won, {{and went on to}} win the 1981 World Series. The Astros did not return to the NLCS until 1986 and did not win a NL pennant until 2005, leading to a loss in the 2005 World Series.|$|E

It was Chelsea's fifth League Cup win, and their first {{silverware}} in the second managerial spell of José Mourinho at the club. Chelsea qualified for the next season's UEFA Europa League by winning the match, but eventually qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League.

5|$|Joe Quinn {{became the}} first Australian to make an {{appearance}} in a postseason game for a Major League team, when the Boston Beaneaters met the Cleveland Spiders in a best-of-ninegame series between the season's <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> second half leaders. In 1892, the National League (NL) was the only active Major League, and Boston were already {{considered to be the}} NL pennant winners as they had the best record {{at the end of the}} season, and the series—won by the Beaneaters 5–0 (with one tie)—was considered an exhibition series.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 3, 2005. The game's early going was marked by defense and field goals. Virginia Tech didn't score in the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> Auburn managed just threefield goals, {{including}} one taken inside the Virginia Tech red zone after Auburn failed to score a touchdown from the Tech one-yard line. Tech also {{had a chance to}} score a touchdown from inside their opponent's one-yard line, but like Auburn, failed to do so. The Hokies elected to try for a touchdown rather than a field goal on fourth down, but were stopped. At halftime, Auburn had a 9–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|The clubs {{had also}} been paired {{together}} in the fourth round of the FA Cup in February 2003. Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy of Manchester United, and Patrick Vieira of Arsenal were all shown yellow cards within the first seven minutes of the match and referee Jeff Winter had to call Vieira and Roy Keane together to calm their teammates down. Keane himself received a yellow card in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> Ryan Giggs missed an open goal from 18yards. Arsenal eventually won the match 2–0 and the result infuriated Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{to such an extent}} that he kicked a boot across the changing room that hit David Beckham above the left eye.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final, against Everton, {{was played}} at Villa Park. Everton were renowned for their {{powerful}} midfield of Ball, Harvey and Kendall, but opted to play more defensively than usual. Manchester City nevertheless paid {{special attention to}} this area, and instructed David Connor to man-mark Ball. Mike Doyle suffered an injury in the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> spent 20 minutes off the field. City had the better of the game, but goalscoring chances were missed by Lee and Young. With little time remaining, Young forced a corner. Young took the corner himself, from which teenager Tommy Booth scored the game's only goal.|$|E
5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half.

Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever.

5|$|Benfica opened April in Azores against Santa Clara on the 6th. Lacking attacking options, {{the team}} was unable to score and ended with a goalless draw; they {{remained}} ahead of Porto only with the goal difference. On 14 April, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. With two goals in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> another two in the second, the team won 4–0 and remained in third. A week later, Benfica visited Sporting for the second Derby de Lisboa of the season. Despite a first score by Jankauskas, a mistake by Armando Sá allowed Sporting's Jardel to score from the penalty spot. With its third draw in just one month, Benfica was overtaken by Porto in the league table, dropping to fourth. On the 28th, Benfica hosted Boavista, knowing that by beating them, they would award the league title to Sporting. The meet ended with a 2–1 win for Benfica, after Mantorras took advantage of an error from Bassey William Andem in the 81st minute, confirming the second title in three years for Sporting.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{were drawn}} to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round, with Birmingham {{dominating}} the first half through a David Murphy goal. Daniel Sturridge scored {{in the second half}} to force a replay, which was played on 6 March at Birmingham, just two days after André Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager. Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> looked the stronger side at times, but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle. In the Sixth Round, Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5–2 thriller. Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a corner in the 12th minute, with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later. In the second half, Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score, before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline. Torres scored again in the 85th minute to put the result beyond doubt, although Ben Marshall grabbed one back three minutes later, before Meireles scored in the 90th minute to send Chelsea through to the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault {{was given}} the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw.

He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the <b>first</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better in training camp as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E
