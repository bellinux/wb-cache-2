5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an <b>extension</b> <b>arm</b> fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

50|$|The North Eastern Railway (NER) began {{planning}} for a rival dock east of Alexandra Dock began in the 1890s, eventually leading to a joint agreement between the NER and Hull and Barnsley Railway (HBR), and an Act of Parliament in 1899, the Joint Dock Act. Construction of the dock was delayed, beginning 1906 for completion in 1914, {{at which point the}} new dock became officially known as the King George Dock. An <b>extension</b> <b>arm</b> of the dock to the south-east, sharing the same lock was opened as the Queen Elizabeth Dock in 1969.

50|$|Due to the {{elongated}} {{shape of}} the city and the terrain conditions, the trolleybus network was planned along main streets. The network is powered with overhead lines because most of the network is located on wide, bi-directional streets. The overhead lines are supported with lateral suspension lines or <b>extension</b> <b>arms.</b> From 1998, the overhead lines began to be overhauled with modern suspension lines produced by the Czech company Elektroline. Almost 80% of overhead line intersections and junctions were replaced with new parts. These new parts allow trolleybuses to use greater speeds. Additionally, 32 sectional isolators and two sectional disconnectors were installed.|$|R

An accurate position model allows wider use of continuum robot arms in industrial and medical applications. Furthermore, accurate control can be achieved. This paper illustrates the 3 D position of a constructed soft arm from 4 pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) in parallel, and models the movement of its free end in space. The performance of the contraction and extension PMAs and the behaviour of the contraction and <b>extension</b> <b>arms</b> are analysed, and a comparison between the two arms is explained. Finally, the mathematical models are presented and validated...|$|R

40|$|The Integrated Partial Payload Lifting Assembly (IPPLA) is {{currently}} used to transport and load experimental payloads into the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. It {{is unable to}} carry the astronaut/passenger tunnel without a structural modification. The purpose of this design {{is to create a}} removalbe modification that will allow the IPPLA to lift and carry the passenger tunnel. Modifications evaluated were full-length insert beams which would extend through the existing strongback arms. These beam proposals were eliminated because of high cost and weight. Other proposals evaluated were attachments of cantilever beams to the existing strongback areas. The cantilever proposals reduced cost and weight compared to the full-length modifications. A third method evaluated was to simply make modifications {{to one side of the}} IPPLA therefore reducing the materials of the cantilever proposals by 40 percent. The design of the modification selected was completed with two channel beams jointly welded to a centered steel plate. The <b>extension</b> <b>arm</b> modification is inserted into the existing strongback channel beams and bolted into place. Two extension arms are added to one side of the IPPLA to provide the extra length needed to accommodate the passenger tunnel.
