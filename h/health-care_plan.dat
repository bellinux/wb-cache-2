5000|$|Within {{the first}} hours of Trump's presidency, he signed his first {{executive}} order, Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal (EO 13765) to fulfill {{part of his}} pledge to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), {{which was part of}} a series of steps taken prior to 2017 to repeal and defund the ACA, including most recently, the FY2017 budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 3, that contained language allowing the repeal of ACA through the budget reconciliation process. A CBO report estimated 18 million people would lose their insurance and premiums would rise by 20% to 25% in the first year after repealing Obamacare. Uninsured could reach 32 million by 2026, while premiums could double. The order states what Mr. Trump made clear during his campaign: that it is his administration's policy to seek the [...] "prompt repeal" [...] of Obamacare. During his Fox News interview with Bill O'Reilly airing before the Super Bowl, Trump announced that the timeline for replacing Obamacare had to be extended and that a replacement would probably not be ready until 2018. Republicans are limited as to how much of ACA they can undo as {{they do not have a}} 60-vote majority in the Senate. They also [...] "must balance the interests of insurers and medical providers". According to the March 13, 2017 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) on the budgetary impact of the Republican bill to repeal and replace ACA over the coming decade, there would be a $337 billion reduction in the federal deficit and an estimated loss of coverage to 24 million more Americans. The Republican <b>health-care</b> <b>plan</b> was unveiled on March 6 and faced opposition from both moderate and conservative Republicans, such as the House Freedom Caucus. The American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), a bill to repeal and replace the ACA, was withdrawn in Congress on March 24, 2017 due to lack of support from within the Republican caucus.|$|E

40|$|Background. Sponsors of public-sector {{health plans}} (plan sponsors) face {{challenges}} in providing stable, sustainable health-care benefits. Health-care cost inflation has put plan sponsors {{in the position}} of continually reacting to increased costs, rather than following a long-term plan. Plan sponsors need to find ways to manage the costs of their health-care plans within the organization’s financial framework and structure in order to be more efficient while continuing to offer a slate of health-care benefits that allows the organization to be competitive in the marketplace. Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that plan sponsors consider developing and formally adopting a long-term, strategic plan that includes guiding principles and key objectives for managing health-care costs and improving participant wellness. The strategic plan design should consider both incremental changes and major initiatives to establish an efficient and effective structure that will enable the plan sponsor to provide the desired level of health-care coverage while maintaining those costs at sustainable levels. While smaller jurisdictions may not have the resources to undertake every recommendation set forth below, effecting any of these suggestions will yield benefits. Accordingly, plan sponsors should take the following steps: 1. Determine the purpose of the <b>health-care</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{spread of}} Zika virus in the Americas has been {{associated}} with a surge in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases. Given the severity of GBS, territories affected by Zika virus need to <b>plan</b> <b>health-care</b> resources to manage GBS patients. To inform such planning in Martinique, we analyzed Zika virus surveillance and GBS data from Martinique in real time with a modeling framework that captured dynamics of the Zika virus epidemic, the risk of GBS in Zika virus–infected persons, and the clinical management of GBS cases. We compared our estimates with those from the 2013 – 2014 Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia. We were able to predict just a few weeks into the epidemic that, due to lower transmission potential and lower probability of developing GBS following infection in Martinique, the total number of GBS cases in Martinique would be substantially lower than suggested by simple extrapolations from French Polynesia. We correctly predicted that 8 intensive-care beds and 7 ventilators would be sufficient to treat GBS cases. This study showcased the contribution of modeling to inform local <b>health-care</b> <b>planning</b> during an outbreak. Timely studies that estimate the proportion of infected persons that seek care are needed to improve the predictive power of such approaches...|$|R
40|$|We {{agree with}} Mistry et al.

40|$|Introduction: The ailments afflicting {{the elderly}} {{population}} is a well-defined specialty of medicine. It {{calls for an}} immaculately designed <b>health-care</b> <b>plan</b> to treat diseases in geriatrics. For chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease, and hypertension (HTN), they require proper management {{throughout the rest of}} patient's life. An integrated treatment pathway helps in treatment decision-making and improving standards of health care for the patient. Case Presentation: This case describes an exclusive clinical pharmacist-driven designing of an integrated treatment pathway for a post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) geriatric male patient with DM type I and HTN for the treatment of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance. Intervention: The treatment begins addressing the chief complaints which were vomiting and unconsciousness. Biochemical screening is essential to establish a diagnosis of electrolyte imbalance along with blood glucose level after which the integrated pathway defines the treatment course. Conclusion: This individualized treatment pathway provides an outline of the course of treatment of acute hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance as well as some unconfirmed diagnosis, namely, acute coronary syndrome and respiratory tract infection for a post-CABG geriatric patient with HTN and type 1 DM. The eligibility criterion for patients to be treated according to treatment pathway is to fall in the defined category...|$|E

Data mining and statistical techniques were used to analyze databases collected by a regional Public Heath Institute. We also studied organizational aspects of public health resources in the selected Celje region with the objective to identify the areas that are atypical in terms of availability and accessibility of public health services for the population. The most important step was the detection of outliers and the analysis of availability and accessibility deviations. The results are applicable to <b>health-care</b> <b>planning</b> and support in decision making by local and regional health-care authorities.
