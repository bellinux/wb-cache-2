40|$|Conclusions: (1) The {{inoculation}} {{of animals}} with horse foal blood of 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd generations caused a mortality of 7 out of 186, or 4 per cent. (2) The inoculation of animals with horse foal blood of 4 th, 5 th, 6 th, 7 th and 8 th generations caused a mortality of 1 in 16, or 6 per cent. (3) The inoculation of animals with <b>donkey</b> <b>foal</b> blood of 2 nd to 6 th generation caused no mortality amongst 25 animals. (4) The reactions caused by injection of horse foal blood were {{more severe than}} those given by injection of <b>donkey</b> <b>foal</b> blood. (5) No cases of relapses after discharge have occurred, proving that the immunity given by the injection of <b>donkey</b> <b>foal</b> blood {{is as good as}} that afforded by horse foal blood. (6) For further immunisation purposes, therefore, I recommend the passing of blood originating from a natural infection of a donkey with piroplasma equi through donkey foals, and to use 1 c. c. blood of that obtained from the 4 th generation and upwards, bearing in mind the precautionary measures mentioned above. (7) Finally, all foals kept for tapping purposes, and used in connection with the inoculation, must be kept free from ticks. This precaution has been carried out at this Laboratory with all foals used in the experiments, and {{it stands to reason that}} a reinfection bv means of ticks would increase the virulency of the blood which is to be used as vaccine.

The results showed that, in jennies, mammary secretion of IgG levels (ranging between 16 and 75 mg/mL) and IgA (0. 9 - 2 mg/mL), and IgG (6. 8 - 13. 5 mg/mL) and IgA (0. 5 - 2. 4 mg/mL) serum concentrations were not different along the time of study. Also, IgG concentrations in serum of foals did not show significant differences although a high level was observed at 12 hours after birth (8 mg/mL), and IgA concentrations in serum of foals did not show any significant difference, although a high level was observed at 12 hours after birth (1. 2 mg/mL). Lysozyme increased significantly at Day 2 after parturition in mammary secretions of jennies (551. 9 μg/mL) and at 12 hours in serum of foals (25. 9 μg/mL). The study demonstrated that the pattern of passive immune transfer in donkey foals seems to be similar to that reported for the horse foal, with IgG predominating IgA in serum and mammary secretions of the jenny and also in serum of foals.

Because blood {{gas analysis}} parameters have not previously been studied in any depth in <b>donkey</b> <b>foals,</b> this study was performed on 16 healthy Martina Franca <b>donkey</b> <b>foals</b> born after an uncomplicated delivery. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected at 5 minutes and at 12, 24, 72, and 96 hours of age. Blood gas analysis was performed by a portable analyzer, measuring arterial and venous total carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2), oxygen partial pressure (pO 2), oxygen saturation (sO 2), bicarbonate, base excess (BE), pH, and lactate (LT). Lower blood pH values, pO 2 and sO 2, and a higher level of lactate were found at birth in comparison with subsequent sampling times. This moderate acidotic profile disappeared at 12 hours, when all the parameters became constant until the end of the study period. As expected, significant differences between arterial and venous blood gas parameters related to the oxygenation, such as pO 2 and sO 2, and partially carbon dioxide partial pressure were found, whereas total carbon dioxide, pH, BE, and LT were comparable in arterial and venous blood samples. For these latter parameters, the highly significant correlation between arterial and venous findings suggests that venous samples could be an acceptable alternative to the arterial sample for {{blood gas analysis}} in newborn <b>donkey</b> <b>foals,</b> when the oxygenation status of the patient is not the first goal of patient analysis...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest on donkey milk production, on its characteristics, and also on breeding techniques. Donkey milk is characterized by high economic value, although the productive level of jennies is poor. During the milking process, foals are usually separated from their dams, allowing the milk collection in the mammary gland of jennies before milking session. This takes 8  h per day of fastening period for lactating <b>donkey</b> <b>foals.</b> During this period, it could be possible to apply a partial artificial suckling system (artificial suckling during daytime and natural suckling during the night). The aim of the work is the evaluation of the effect of this innovative technique on in vivo performances and on meat production traits of Martina Franca <b>donkey</b> <b>foals.</b> Forty Martina Franca jennies with their foals were used for the trial. After colostrum assumption, 20 foals were partially artificially suckled (AS) during each day, and 20 foals were naturally suckled (NS). From 8. 00 to 20. 00, both groups were separated from their mothers in order to allow the milking procedures of the jennies. The AS group was in a stall equipped with an automatic calf-suckling machine. For each group, 10 foals were slaughtered at 12  months and 10 foals at 18  months. Artificial suckling system positively affected the growth rate of <b>donkey</b> <b>foals,</b> particularly in the first 6  months from birth, with higher weekly weight gain (P[*] [*] 0. 05).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nicoletella {{semolina}} is {{gram-negative bacterium}} recently described as {{member of the}} Pasteurellaceae family(1). N. semolina has been isolated from horses with respiratory disorders (2) however it is still unclear if this bacterium plays a role as potential pathogen, opportunistic or just as commensal of the normal bacteriological flora. To the best of authors’ knowledge there are no descriptions of the isolation of this bacterium in donkeys. The aim of the present report is to describe, for the first time, the isolation of N. semolina in a <b>donkey</b> <b>foal</b> from Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three 2 - 3 -month-old crossbreed donkey carcass (A-B-C) were submitted to the necropsy. Anamnesis reported severe respiratory disorders before death. At necropsy in all foals was reported generalized pneumonia associated with purulent-catarrhal collection and emphysema diffuse; the foal A showed lesions in all lung lobes, pericardial effusion and subsequent cardiac tamponade. Samples were collected from lungs and were plated onto two Blood Agar Base and MacConkey agar SS plates, and incubated aerobically and in microaerophilia at 37 °C± 1 °C for 72 h. The plates were observed every 24 h. On all isolates were performed identification using the Vitek 2 Compact system (bioMérieux). On the strain isolated from the foal A was performed the sequencing and analysis of 16 S rRNA genes. PCR was performed with MicroSeq 500 rDNA PCR Kit (Life Thecnoligies). Amplification products of the 16 SrRNA genes were used for cycle sequencing with MicroSeq 500 rDNA Sequencing Kit. Sequence analysis and alignment were carried out using SeqScape v. 2. 5 (Applied Biosystem) and NCBI/BLAST/blastn suite. RESULTS: After 24 h of incubation aerobic bacterial cultures of all 3 foals (A-B-C) in Blood Agar Base yielded heavy growth of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus; {{at the same time}} point in MacConkey agar plates (foal C) was detected the co-presence of Salmonella kasenyi. After 48 h of incubation in Blood Agar Base plates (foal B) was isolated Nocardia spp. Furthermore at 72 h in in Blood Agar Base plates (foal A) was detected the appearance of colonies gray, rounded, waxy, nonhaemolytic, nonadherent, similar to a grain of semolina wheat (1).

For this reason, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the age-related changes of hematologic and biochemical parameters in Martina Franca <b>donkey</b> <b>foals</b> during the first 3 weeks of life and of blood gases during the first 24 hours of age. Fifteen healthy <b>donkey</b> <b>foals</b> were enrolled; blood samples were collected from each foal at 10 minutes after birth, 1 hour after the first and second suckles, 12 and 24 hours after birth, daily from Day 2 to 7, and at Days 10, 14, and 21 of life. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets counts were assessed; also metabolic (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinphospokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total proteins, albumins, cholesterol, and total bilirubin) and electrolytic parameters (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, and Cl) were evaluated. Finally, blood gases and metabolic parameters (pH, pCO 2, pO 2, sO 2, TCO 2, HCO 3, lactate, and base excess) on venous blood were assessed with a portable analyzer. A statistical analysis to evaluate the influence of age and sex was performed. Several differences were found between sampling times, demonstrating that age influences these parameters.

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} ultrasonographic measures of the dorsal subarachnoid space depth in healthy Amiata <b>donkey</b> <b>foals,</b> in order to obtain a range of values to be used as references. Material and methods. The dorsal subarachnoid space depth was recorded in ten Amiata <b>donkey</b> <b>foals</b> at 1 day (T 1), 4 (T 4) days and 7 (T 7) days of life measuring the distance between the dura mater and the dorsal portion of the pia mater in a cross-sectional just cranial to the wings of atlas. The probe was rotated and the longitudinal scan was visualized, then measurements were taken just caudal to the occipital bone at the level of the cisterna magna. Average and standard deviation were calculated. Skeweness-Kurtosis test was applied to verify data distribution. Analysis of variance was applied to verify differences among measurements at different time points. Results. Cross sectional measurements were 0. 64 ± 0. 05 cm at T 1, 0. 62 ± 0. 07 cm at T 4 and 0. 65 ± 0. 06 cm at T 7, while longitudinal measurements were 0. 60 ± 0. 07 cm at T 1, 0. 61 ± 0. 06 cm at T 4 and 0. 65 ± 0. 05 cm at T 7. No differences in dorsal subarachnoid space death were observed at the different times of evaluation. Discussion and conclusions. A correlation between cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) pressure and ultrasound measurements at the dorsal subarachnoid space depth has been recently reported in the equine foal. This measurement can be considered a safe, reliable and not invasive method to evaluate equine foals with neurologic signs in the perinatal period and to assess indirectly the increase of CSF pressure.

40|$|In recent years, an {{increase}} in the number of donkeys farmed in Italy as a consequence of the growing demand for donkey milk for direct consumption has been observed. Some research has been carried out on jenny milk composition and on its nutritional properties, whereas milk production features are scarcely described for this species. In this work, the lactation curve shape of donkeys for milk yield and composition was investigated. A total of 453 test-day records for milk yield, fat and protein percentage, and somatic cell count of 62 lactations measured on 46 multiparous jennies of the Ragusano breed were considered. Effects of herd, age, and foaling season were assessed by using a mixed model analysis. Average and individual lactation curves were fitted using the Wood incomplete gamma function, the Cappio-Borlino modified gamma, and a third-order Legendre orthogonal polynomial model. <b>Donkeys</b> <b>foaling</b> between 6 - and 10 -yr-old had the highest test-day milk yield (about 1. 85 kg/d). <b>Donkeys</b> <b>foaling</b> in winter and autumn had a higher daily milk yield compared with those foaling in summer and spring. Less defined results were obtained for composition traits. The general pattern of the donkey lactation curve is similar to the standard shape reported for the main dairy ruminant species, with a peak yield occurring at about 5 wk from parturition. Younger jennies tended to have lower production peaks and higher lactation persistency. Similarly to what is reported for dairy cattle, a large variability in individual patterns has been observed. No differences in goodness of fit have been observed between the models in the case of average lactation curves, whereas orthogonal polynomials were more efficient in fitting individual patterns...|$|R

Gestation length was longer in the donkeys than the other two groups (median values: 371 vs. 327 and 341 days, P < 0. 05). There were significant correlations between foal birthweight and gross area (rho = 0. 89; n = 20; P < 0. 05), mass (rho = 0. 84; n = 20; P < 0. 05) and volume (rho = 0. 89; n = 20; P < 0. 05) of the allantochorion. S(v) was higher in the donkey placenta than the other groups (median values: 0. 05 vs. 0. 03 and 0. 04 microm(- 1), P < 0. 05) although placental efficiency was lower in the donkeys (median values: 0. 87 vs. 1. 33 and 1. 32 kg/m 2, P < 0. 01). The results of the study confirmed that, although strong morphological similarities exist between the allantochorion of the horse and donkey, that of the donkey develops more complex microcotyledons, as judged stereologically, and exhibits a lower placental efficiency. These differences may be related to maternal genotype and/or the longer gestation length shown by the donkey compared to the horse, but a negative correlation (rho = - 0. 92, P < 0. 01) was also found between age and placental efficiency in donkeys.
