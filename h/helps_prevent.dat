5|$|In {{addition}} to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> obesity.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Zinc has an {{electron}} configuration of 3d104s2 {{and is a}} member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> further reaction with air and water.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E

5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the road, a solution that <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E
5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. The retinoids appear {{to influence the}} cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E

On the island she is initially held hostage by one of the plane crash survivors, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), but is freed when another person from her team switches place with her. She <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> poison gas from being released over the island, and develops a relationship with Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). Charlotte dies in Daniel's arms after the frequent time traveling causes her headaches to worsen into something unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and <b>helps</b> <b>prevent</b> disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E
