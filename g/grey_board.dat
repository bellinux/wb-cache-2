40|$|We analyse the SoftKinetic DepthSense 325 {{range imaging}} camera for {{precision}} and accuracy in ranging out to 3 m. Flat planar targets (one a <b>grey</b> <b>board,</b> the other made from retroreflective material) are imaged {{at a variety of}} distances. Straight-forward image processing is used to identify the target and calculate the range and the root mean square variation in ranging to the target. It is found that inaccuracies in ranging of up to 2 cm occur to the <b>grey</b> <b>board</b> when imaging over 0 m to 1. 5 m and the precision in ranging degrades from just below 1 cm at 0 m to almost 10 cm at 1. 5 m. Similar inaccuracies occur with the retroreflective target but the precision is always under 1 cm even out to 3 m due to the strong signal return received from the target...|$|E
