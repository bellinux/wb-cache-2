The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E

25|$|A cool box, cooler, {{portable}} ice chest, chilly bin, or esky {{most commonly}} is an insulated box {{used to keep}} perishable food or beverages cool. <b>Ice</b> <b>cubes,</b> which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water. The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24, 1951 and was issued U.S. patent #2,663,157 on December 22, 1953.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with fresh herbs, spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} {{emerges from}} the passage and teeters {{on the edge of}} a vast pit of lava. Another transport is seen attempting to cross a rickety rope bridge which spans the pit under a crumbling ceiling. On the far side of the cavern, there is a 45-foot-tall stone face of Mara, that periodically shoots green rays at both transports, causing flames to erupt from where the beam hits. Formerly, there was an effect in place within this scene where the light beams would hit the ceiling, causing dyed <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> to rain down, simulating the rubble of the caving temple, but it was removed. The light beams have now been redirected away from the former effect, however, the sound effect for the rubble still plays upon entering the room. The transport turns left and enters catacombs of false pathways lined with skeletons, some of which pop out toward the guests.|$|E
500|$|The pisco sour {{has three}} {{different}} methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail {{is made by}} mixing Peruvian pisco with Key lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and <b>ice</b> <b>cubes.</b> The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with Pica lime juice, powdered sugar, and <b>ice</b> <b>cubes.</b> Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions [...] "is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not." [...] The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its [...] "New Era Drinks," [...] {{is similar to the}} Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.|$|E

The HouseGuest who was closest to the center would be the Head of Household. Jessie was the winner. Though numerous HouseGuests expected Ronnie to be nominated that week, Jessie informed Natalie and Russell that he would be making his own decisions that week, rather than listening to the other HouseGuests.

For this competition, one HouseGuest from each clique competed, and were required to attempt to fill their opponents cans with various plastic ice cubes; the clique with the most <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> in there can would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique, consisting of Chima, Michele, and Ronnie, were the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Jessie chose to nominate Jordan and Michele for eviction, with the intention of seeing Casey be evicted that week. Despite Jessie's nominations, Casey, Jeff, Jordan, and Michele were still under the impression that Ronnie was the target for eviction rather than Casey. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Casey, and Chima were selected to compete; Natalie was selected to host. On Day 21, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "When Pigs Fly" [...] Power of Veto competition.
