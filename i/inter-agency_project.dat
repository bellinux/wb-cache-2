Objective of this visit {{was to determine the}} influence of environmental pollution on the health of the population. Concern had arisen about e. g. a rise in congenital abnormalities. Results: The general population of Ventspils {{does not seem to be}} exposed to high concentrations of chemicals in the environment. Figures on health status, disease frequency or mortality of the population in Latvia are not very reliable; the same can be said about e. g. the figures on congenital abnormalities. There is a great lack of epidemiological knowledge in Latvia. Recommendations: The data on congenital abnormalities in Ventspils have to be assembled and investigated in a different way, taking into account confounding factors. Training is needed, locally as well as on a governmental level in (environmental) epidemiology...|$|E
40|$|The Congo Forest Conservation Project, {{established}} in 1991, is an <b>inter-agency</b> cooperative <b>project</b> aimed at promoting forest conservation throughout Congo, {{and particularly in}} the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park The project challenges include: highly-mobile human populations; natural systems not corresponding to political divisions; competition for land-use by other interests; political instability; lack of conservation tradition; cyclical nature of funding; communications and logistics; personnel considerations; and lack of appropriate judicial and legislative support. The Ndoki model is based on guidelines intended to support the project’s primary goal of perpetuating the physical and biological integrity of the natural systems in northern Congo. Basic model components include: development of and focus on the primary goal; collaborating with local and government stakeholders; constant adaptation and modification; conservation activity promotion based on ‘enlightened self-interest’; education and professional training; development activities to take place away from conservation areas; international awareness. Local participation and cooperation are considered in more detail and practical considerations are outlined. This paper presents characteristics of the goals, design, and actual situation surrounding the Nouabalé-Ndoki Project in the northern Republic of Congo (Brazzaville).

40|$|Damage caused {{to objects}} of {{cultural}} heritage {{is one of}} the most serious detrimental effects of air pollutants. Within the 6 th Framework Programme of the EU, the CULT-STRAT <b>project</b> is an <b>inter-agency,</b> multi-disciplinary <b>project</b> that has integrated research and monitoring information to provide answers to policy and management questions, which relate the effects of air pollutants on heritage and the management options available to mitigate them. The overall aim of the project has been to assess and predict the effects of different pollutants on materials and objects of cultural heritage in a multipollutant scenario and to identify indicators and thresholds levels of pollutants. These have been used for development of management strategies for sustainable maintenance and preventive conservation of European Cultural Heritage and air quality policy from continental to local scale. The present paper reports one of the studies carried out in the CULT-STRAT project at city level and focused on the town of Madrid (Spain). Different maps are shown for the present and possible future scenarios (2010 and 2020) : inventory of stock of cultural heritage for each selected material, concentration of selected pollutants (SO 2, NO 2, O 3 and PM 10), corrosion (cast bronze) and recession (Portland limestone), exceedance of tolerable degradation thresholds for each material and corrosion-cultural heritage overlapped maps. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Predictions {{of smoke}} impacts on {{communities}} and ecosystems {{are currently being}} made by the BlueSky smoke forecast system; providing real-time predictions of surface smoke concentrations from prescribed fire, wildfire, and agricultural burn activities. Currently operational in the Pacific Northwest, BlueSky has already a demonstrated success regarding what inter-agency collaboration can accomplish. A critical component of BlueSky {{that needed to be}} addressed was the development of an automated verification system to evaluate predicted impacts from smoke on communities and ecosystems. A verification system is necessary because land managers need to evaluate their burn decisions against potential National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) exceedences. To achieve this, the verification of predicted concentrations against observed must be provided in a timely (i. e. real-time) manner. Thus the original proposal included two major components: 1) improving existing monitoring systems to make the data available in real-time (e. g., {{in a manner similar to}} the Washington State Department of Ecology, WSDOE); and 2) implementing a software system that compares these observational data with the smoke concentration fields predicted by BlueSky. Directly and indirectly, BlueSky has sparked several <b>inter-agency</b> field <b>projects.</b> Projects include JFSP funded field projects of wildfires (predominately conducted on the West Coast and Northwest) and prescribed burns on the Atlantic Coast. In 2004, EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt tasked the EPA with implementing BlueSky RAINS for the 2005 fire season across all Western States for wildfires. The result was the multi-agency 2005 BlueSky RAINS West (BSRW) demonstration project. The project developed a new partnership among the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, Pacific Southwest, and Southern Research Stations; Forest Service National Forest Systems and State and Private Forestry, EPA; and the Department of the Interior...|$|R

40|$|The {{first step}} in a program of work to extend an {{existing}} model of the global economy to encompass Australia and New Zealand regions is illustrated. In this model, which gives special emphasis to the constraints caused by the depletion of natural resources, the world is divided into regions, and production into a number of sectors. A qualitative outline is provided of the model structure in its existing and its planned extended form. The results of three sets of experiments pertaining to the extended form of model are shown. First, we address, in a preliminary way, potential patterns of trade in food between various regions of the world and Australia and New Zealand. Second, the focus is on trade in energy. Third, a brief look at trade in minerals completes the illustration of the first step to extend the existing world model.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{establish}} what potential law enforcement strategies employed {{at a local}} have to influence {{the problems associated with}} drug supply and use. The author intends to accomplish this by examining the policies and practices adopted by the North Central Divisional Drug Unit (NCDDU) between 1994 and 1998. The question of how supply-side and demand-side enforcement strategies are implemented at a local level will be examined. An attempt will be made to identify how local community approval for the NCDDU drugs policies was achieved in a locality with has attributes that frequently lead to poor relationships between communities and police. Context will be proved by an analysis of the current role of the Garda Síochána in regards to addressing drug-related problems. This requires an examination of Garda policy and practices, recent drug-related legislative changes, changes in government policy and Ireland’s international obligations. The research material utilised in this thesis includes published statistics relating to the drugs problem in the north inner city of Dublin and documentation emanating from within relevant organisations, such as ICON Drugs Support Services, the <b>Inter-Agency</b> Drugs <b>Project</b> (IADP) and the NCDDU. The author also conducted two interviews in order to obtain specific information, firstly with the Chairperson of ICON {{to establish}} the community perception of the Garda Síochána response to the drug problem in the north inner city, and secondly with the Deputy Garda Commissioner to establish the circumstances which motivated him to found the NCDDU. This study found that recently enacted legislation has increased Garda ability to police drug problems at a local level. The public order legislation and the legislation designed to improve estate management in local authority housing developments affords the Gardaí with powers to deal with ‘quality of life’ issues, which are of particular concern to those living in areas were drug selling and use take place. Policing strategies such as those involved in Operation Dochas, when combined with the focused strategies of dedicated drugs units operating in local communities, have the potential to {{have a significant impact on}} many of the problems associated with drugs. Government policy has also impacted on the role of the Garda Síochána with regard to drug problems experienced at a local level. In particular, the creation of LDTFs introduces am important role for the Garda Síochána within an inter-agency context. Consultation, openness, transparency and increased accountability are elements this thesis identifies as having led to an improvement in the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the local communities in Dublin’s north inner city. These changes reflect the achievement of what Lord Scarman viewed as the key elements of community policing –consultation and accountability. This study concludes that the preparation of district and sub-district drugs policing plans, which have been introduced as part of the Corporate Strategy of the Garda Síochána, provide an ideal opportunity to remedy faults which exist in relation to the policing of drugs problems at a local level...|$|R

40|$|Dementia-friendly {{communities}} (DFCs) are a UK policy {{initiative that}} aims to enable people with dementia to feel supported and included within their local community. Current approaches to DFC creation rely on stakeholder involvement, often requiring volunteer assistance. There is though a lack of evidence that examines the reality of achieving this. This paper critically assesses the challenges and strategies for achieving stakeholder involvement in DFCs. The evidence base is drawn from an <b>inter-agency</b> <b>project</b> funded by the National Health Service in the South of England where seven DFCs were developed by steering group partners and four part-time project workers (PWs). Data from the independent evaluation undertaken {{in the first year}} (2013 - 2014) of the project were analysed: 14 semi-structured interviews and a focus group examined PWs' experiences; while progress and key milestones are determined from monthly progress forms, good news stories, locality steering group minutes and press releases. Analysis was undertaken using a directed content analysis method, whereby data content for each locality was matched to the analytical framework that was drawn from Alzheimer's Society guidance. Challenges to achieving stakeholder involvement were identified as: establishing networks and including people representative of the local community; involving people affected by dementia; and gaining commitment from organisations. Strategies for achieving stakeholder involvement were recognised as: a sustainable approach; spreading the word; and sharing of ideas. By highlighting these challenges and the approaches that have been used within communities to overcome them, these findings form the foundation for the creation of DFC initiatives that will become embedded within communities. Stakeholder involvement is unpredictable and changeable; therefore, reliance on this approach questions the long-term sustainability of DFCs, and must be considered in future policies designed to enhance quality of life for people affected by dementia...|$|E
