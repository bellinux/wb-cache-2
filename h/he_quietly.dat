5|$|Linnaeus... was {{the most}} eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the {{atmosphere}} in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.... Toward {{the end of his}} life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E

5|$|Remaining at Rhodes {{during the}} 1940 {{academic}} year, Smith secretly {{made plans to}} leave for military service {{in spite of his}} instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not mention his university attendance, and gave his Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; the interviewer briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to sign up.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E

A few days after his retirement was announced, Newsam was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, Rockefeller {{approached}} Pratt {{with a plan}} {{to cooperate}} and consolidate their businesses. Pratt discussed it with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. Rockefeller had apparently learned a lot about Rogers' talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. <b>He</b> <b>quietly</b> accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out. In this manner, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important independent refiners to join the Standard Oil Trust.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 1971, while Prime Minister, <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> married Margaret Sinclair at St. Stephen's Catholic {{church in}} North Vancouver. Contrary to his publicized exploits, Trudeau was an intense {{intellectual}} with intense work habits and {{little time for}} family or fun, and she felt trapped and bored in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her retroactively diagnosed bipolar depression. After three children, 23rd and current Prime Minister Justin (born 1971), Alexandre (Sacha, born 1973), and Michel (1975–1998), the couple separated in 1977 and were finally divorced in 1984.|$|E

Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the little man was rich.|$|E

Between 25 and 29 October, Souham and Wellington fought a series of actions along the Pisuerga and Carrión Rivers at Palencia, Villamuriel de Cerrato, and Tordesillas which are collectively called the Battle of Tordesillas. When the French seized the bridge over the Duero River at Tordesillas on the 29th, Wellington was {{compelled}} to order a retreat.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1980s, Mubarak {{increased}} {{the production of}} affordable housing, clothing, furniture, and medicine. By the time he became President, Mubarak {{was one of a}} few Egyptian officials who refused to visit Israel and vowed to take a less enthusiastic approach to normalizing relations with the Israeli government.

Egypt's heavy dependence on US aid and its hopes for US pressure on Israel for a Palestinian settlement continued under Mubarak. <b>He</b> <b>quietly</b> improved relations with the former Soviet Union. In 1987, Mubarak won an election to a second six-year term.|$|E

25|$|With {{his father}} growing weaker, Phan {{decided to keep}} a low profile to avoid trouble with the French colonials so that he could support his family. He did so by {{teaching}} and writing, while still continually preparing for examinations. During this time, <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> acquired books on military strategy by the likes of Sun Tzu and Đào Duy Từ, the military strategist of the Nguyễn lords who stopped the Trịnh lords with a defensive wall, and Trần Hưng Đạo, the military commander of the Trần Dynasty who repelled Mongol invasions of Vietnam in the 13th century. Phan cultivated a small number of his students whom he identified as having abundant pro-independence sentiments. He enthusiastically received visits from Cần Vương visitors and passed on their tales to his students, particularly those concerning Phan Đình Phùng, who led the Cần Vương effort.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Senate {{resolved}} to raise new armies against Hannibal under the recently elected consuls of 217 BC, Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Gaius Flaminius Nepos. The latter had long distrusted his fellow senators and feared {{that they would}} try to sabotage his command by finding excuses to delay his departure. So <b>he</b> <b>quietly</b> left Rome to take over his army at Ariminum without performing the lengthy religious rituals required of an incoming consul. The Senate voted unanimously to recall him, but he ignored its orders. This caused widespread dismay among the Romans, who feared that Flaminius' disrespect for the gods would bring disaster on Rome. As it was expected that Hannibal would advance into central Italy, Flaminius moved his army from Ariminum to Arretium, to cover the Apennine mountain passes into Etruria. His colleague Servilius, who had performed the proper rituals and was therefore well behind Flaminius, replaced him with his freshly raised army at Ariminum to cover the route along the Adriatic coast. A third force, containing the survivors of previous engagements, was also stationed in Etruria under Scipio. Thus both the eastern and western routes to Rome appeared guarded.|$|E
