50|$|Language {{teachers}} have been avid users of technology {{for a very long}} time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers’ voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, <b>film-strip</b> projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are Ecouter et Parler (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings) and Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a <b>film-strip</b> - based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).|$|E

40|$|Drawing upon {{research}} into British artists’ moving {{image of the}} 1970 s and 1980 s, this talk discussed how experimental film and video works often critique history by depicting archival material – still photos, documents, clips – using documentary formats to reveal counter-histories. Exploring the difficulties of writing about this subject matter, concerned {{as it is with}} ‘medium specific’ dialogues that focus upon technologies (such as the materiality of <b>film-strips</b> or unique aesthetic qualities of recording and watching early video) this 20 -minute presentation explored ‘remediation’ and the archive, referring to the work of artist Elizabeth Price. As a researcher concerned with sound as well as image, the paper considered how experimental moving image often traverses fact, fiction and multi-sensory representation by using ‘the archive’ as content and subject matter. Through discussion of my own experiences researching in archival collections, it reflected upon the tensions underlying research that traces, charts and maps ephemeral contexts of performance, recorded audio-visual material and how these narratives are translated by the mediums – whether written or technological – through which they reach us today...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} Leica prototypes {{were developed}} by the company Ernst Leitz during {{the first years of}} the 20th century, but marketing did not commence until the mid 1920s. The Leicas were innovative, by orienting the image frame sideways for the 35 mm film as opposed to the cine-camera tradition of across the <b>film-strip.</b> The cameras were compact with collapsible lenses, for hiking and biking. The rangefinder feature was added with the Leica II during 1932, and that year both rangefinder and viewfinder cameras became available with interchangeable lenses. In 1933 the Leica III offered slow-speed shutter controls and a fast 1/1000th shutter speed, and various iterations of the III (a,b,c,d,f,&g) series became the flagship models and best sellers into the late 1950s. Further iterations of the models I and II were offered, but did not sell well.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop, {{implement}} and evaluate a short-term Career Awareness program for delivery to ninth grade students attending rural schools in Newfoundland. – Two hundred and six student from 10 rural schools Participated in this study. Students from one-half the participating schools were post-test only after participation in the program, while the remaining students were pre-tested and post-tested with the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI). The two-hour audio-visual program was administered to students during the first two weeks of February and the first two weeks of March, 1979. Each Career Awareness program contained four (4) <b>film-strips,</b> two (2) cassette tapes with recordings on each side, student work sheets to accompany the filmstrips, and a Career Awareness Teacher Manual. A teacher evaluation form was sent to each participating teacher to assess the teacher’s reaction to the program. – The results of the CMI were analyzed to answer each research question. T-tests were conducted on the data to determine if any significant differences existed in career maturity as a result of exposure to the program, if significant differences existed between the February and March groups, and if significant differences existed between mean scores of students who attended schools with a part-time counsellor and schools with no counsellor. The results of the analysis of variance indicated that significant differences did exist between the mean pre-test and post-test scores of the groups who were administered both tests. Significant differences did not occur in any other analysis of variance. – The results of the evaluation form were analyzed to assess the teacher’s reaction to the Career Awareness program. The results of the analysis of the data indicated that teachers who administered the program felt it was effective with respect to the audio and visual portions. The results revealed that the teachers felt their students would also rate the program as being effective. In addition, all teachers surveyed indicated a willingness to use the program again. – The conclusion was that significant differences did not occur in career maturity as a result of participation in the program, as measured by the CMI; however, teachers assessed the program as being effective and useful...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{two year}} {{research}} project {{in the department of}} Experimental Psychology at Oxford University with neuroscientist Kia Nobre I exhibited work at the Ashmolean Museum. I installed photographs from a new photographic series called Freshers; the complete series Heimlich taken during a TrAIN residency in Germany and Diorama (colour channels), a small object launched with the Multiple Store in different galleries of the collections. The interventions were accompanied by a series of talks and workshops including a joint lecture with Prof Nobre in the Headley Lecture Theatre - Ashmolean Museum. Approaching from the displays of ancient Greek pottery, visitors encountered the triptychs Freshers on the staircase opposite regency portrait busts by Sir Francis Chantrey. Since my installation and online project walkalone-neverwalkalone at the Harris museum responding to Greek and Roman Friezes of sport and war, I have been interested in their depiction of groups of people in movement and how this relates to my panoramic <b>film-strips.</b> There is an ambiguity whether the people in silhouette are instances of the same person over time or different people doing similar activities. These temporal and spatial shifts are evident in the ancient Greek vases at the Ashmolean showing silhouettes of mainly women in daily life and in the taking of the photographs of students in the same position over time and their juxtaposition into new narratives. The triptych of various combinations of students’ photographs are hung over several levels adjacent to portrait Chantrey busts. The series heimlich, which consists of 19 photographs, was taken during a residency at Künstlerhaus Schloss Balmoral in Germany not far from the place where I grew up. The photographs of reflections {{on the surface of the}} river Lahn were installed along the small landscape sketches in the Oil Skech Gallery. The reflected buildings, landscape and sky are presented upside down as mirror images. The movement of the water creates movement in the images (distortions and abstractions) that take on the quality of an elusive memory. The juxtaposition of the inverted landscape photographs with the paintings create a dynamic instability and trigger a perceptual reorganization in our minds. Diorama (colour channels) was shown in one of the Renaissance galleries where the transparent images of people walking overlap with multiples/objects and paintings of the time...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{commissioned}} by the Multiple Store diorama: [Greek dia= through + horama =view] a scene on translucent material; illusion of depth, movement or narrative is created with two layers of relating images. In 2008 Sigune Hamann showed a large-scale site-specific photographic installation at the Gallery of Photography, Dublin, built on the original site of one of Daguerre’s dioramas. With the change of daylight and artificial light, and {{the position of the}} viewer, one or other translucent layered images predominates, both changing and merging over time. The <b>film-strip</b> process involves using a photographic camera like a movie camera, exposing a whole roll of photographic film in one continuous rewinding movement while moving (walking or turning) herself. Her new multiple diorama (colour channels), part of a <b>film-strip</b> of people walking over London Bridge, shows a continuous merging of colours and shades, which result in a vivid, changing multiple vision. The image is animated by changing viewpoints and light conditions and the background that it frames. Sigune Hamann’s work deals with the passing of time in the fixing of an image and the perception and recollection of events. In photographic film-strips she captures the dynamics of urban environments. Her solo exhibition ‘In the name of’ at Durham Art Gallery (13 July to 6 October 2013) features a 56 meter <b>film-strip</b> installation. Recent projects include ‘wave’ (Wellcome Collections, London, 2012), ‘Whitehall’ (ISEA, Istanbul Biennale, 2011),’ Stillness and Movement’, (Tate Conference 2010), ‘the walking up and down bit’ BFI (2009), ‘undercurrent’ (Kunsthalle Mainz and Gallery of Photography, Dublin, 2008) ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a basic}} {{difference}} between {{the music of the}} silent film era and that of the sound film era. Music for sound films is a material part of the film: the music is printed on the <b>film-strip.</b> Music for silent films was not: the <b>film-strip</b> had no soundtrack. Played live and liable to change from one screening to another, music was rather a part of the film-viewing experience. In Peter Larsen’s words, ‘the music of the silent film is not film music in the modern sense — it is cinema music, an external addition to the moving pictures, part of the total performance more than part of the film and its narrative. ’ I take Larsen’s distinction here primarily as a periodization concerning the physical placement of the music: in the case of sound films, the music is on the film(strip) and thus called ‘film music’; in the case of silent films, the music is in the cinema(s), played live, and thus called ‘cinema music’. We may also think of the distinction as one based on the viewers’ experience of the music {{as a part of the}} film narrative or not — with ‘film music’ being experienced as more narratively integrated with the film, and ‘cinema music’ being experienced more as a silence-filler of the film projection rather than a constituent of the filmic system. The combination of the material/period-based and the narrative/function-based interpretation makes the classification a bit more complicated...|$|E

40|$|The Moment We Knew Nothing of Each Other' is a {{permanent}} installation of a large scale photographic diorama in the foyer of Royal and Derngate Theatres, Northampton. Hamann’s work operates {{in the space between}} the still and the moving image, and is conceptually founded on the integration of old and new media. The permanent photographic installation is inspired by the 19 th century diorama principle of exhibiting translucent pictures with lighting effects and applies the latest digital printing technology to create images in continuous transition and change. Combining Hamann’s original <b>film-strip</b> technique with a novel use of 19 th century diorama optical devices, the imagery creates a metaphysical sense of movement as well as making visible another world behind everyday appearances. The artist positions traces of everyday public performance, people travelling, again in a public meeting place, creating a physicality of real time and recorded movement. Using methods of performance, chance and permanent transition both in the creation of imagery and the technology of display Hamann manages to create a dynamic artwork that will look different each time visited. The piece reflects on the parallel of theatre and photography describing a period of time. The momentary encounter of passers-by photographically frozen on two film-strips, escapes the viewers gaze in the installation when the images are slowly dissolving into each other. In a climate of high resolution realistic photography Hamann’s <b>film-strip</b> imagery offers a new representation of the way we see and observe and the process of observing rather than the observed object itself. Some of the figures walking by have not registered on the film-strips due to the incongruence of the movement of the film in the camera and the movement of the figure. Similarly when we focus our attention on a person or a thing we may not register other persons or things in the same optical field...|$|E
40|$|As {{consumers}} and producers of contemporary visual culture, {{we are in}} an era of high-resolution photographic realism.

Reflecting on ideas of data disinformation, this paper looked at the representation of movement, time and narrative structure in film-strips, and examine shifts of information and overlapping, repetition and blurring of images as part of the analogue and digital process of production. It reflected on ideas of seamlessness and continuity at a time dominated by fragmentation and layering...|$|E
40|$|Practical Reason are a {{snapshot}} – or rather a <b>film-strip</b> – {{of part of}} a philosophical endeavour beginning with his first book, Practical Reflection, and continuing through many a paper produced since including many written after those collected here. The unity of theme and content across both the papers and the book is quite impressive; many of the articles involve attempts to develop, or better articulate, distinctions drawn and arguments made in the book. There is a single, large project here and having some of these articles collected together in a book gives {{us a chance to}} assess how this project is going – or at least how things were going on this particular <b>film-strip.</b> I find myself convinced by many of the arguments deployed and at-tracted by the philosophical intuitions that lie behind the pro-ject. And I find the intricate way many of the pieces fit together satisfyingly neat, indeed elegant. However, I will stick to con-vention and focus here on the places where I am still puzzled about how it is all supposed to fit together. A fundamental philosophical motivation driving the project is an attempt to show how our conception of agency could be compatible with ‘‘our conception of how the world works more generally’ ’ – a conception according to which events are caused by other events or just happen randomly. 1 This is a conception of the world shaped by naturalistic conceptions of explanation in which causation is understood as consisting in ‘‘relations among events and states of affairs’ ’ (130). 2 I will call this the ‘‘causal conception’ ’ for short. Compatibility is shown by combining an analysis of the notion of agency, and other re-lated notions, with an hypothetical model of how such agency could be instantiated or ‘‘realized in the world, as we otherwise understand it’ ’ (129). I will start by focussing on his account o...|$|E
40|$|A frieze-format {{photographic}} print captured at the London student fees {{protests in}} November 2010. Using a photographic {{camera in the}} manner of a film camera, Hamann captured the dynamics of demonstrators moving through Whitehall producing semi-abstract images that retain the character of the moment. For the duration of the exposure the celluloid moves past the lens in the hand-held camera, mirroring the movement of the crowd. This process abstracts and compresses the action revealing both chaos and order, yet details are enough to fix the image as a record of the real event. The photograph was featured as part of the Uncontainable: Broken Stillness exhibition that incorporate either custom written software or hacked packages to draw attention to the role of image-making in contemporary visual arts. The works manipulate data to create images that reside between the moving image and stills of painting and photography.

40|$|Many of the {{existing}} approaches to reverse architect-ing –the reverse engineering of the architecture of software systems – are based on software exploration tools which pro-vide interactive ways of exploring the system. These tools start with high-level views {{of the system and}} refine them with drill-down techniques applied on the high-level enti-ties such as modules and packages, leaving aside valuable information contained in the dependencies between them. In this article we argue that the visualization of inter-module relations bears great potential for support-ing the understanding of large evolving software systems. We present two concrete examples of such visualiza-tions. The first, The Semantic Dependency Matrix is a technique for displaying details about a dependency be-tween two modules which groups together classes with similar behavior. The second, The Edge Evolution <b>Film-strip</b> presents the evolution of an inter-module relation through multiple versions of the system.

40|$|A body of {{photographic}} film-strips taken at demonstrations and public events in Tokyo. Hamann’s residency at Tokyo Wonder Site involved taking panoramic film-strips in public spaces. She observed commuters in Tokyo stations and {{took part in}} many demonstrations which have become much more frequent since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. She captured moments in film-strips when multi directional movement in crowds becomes homogenous and common goals direct people into common movement. Hamann discussed the connections of film-strips with panoramic formats in Japanese culture with curators at the Idemidsu Museum Tokyo and at the National Museum Kyoto to whom she was introduced by Rupert Faulkner, senior Curator of Japanese Art V&A.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was intended to}} explore people's attitudes to the social transaction of giving and receiving help in situations of practical and material need, to assess their willingness to give and to accept help in defined situations, and to record the circumstances which they considered {{to be important in}} deciding whether to give and to accept help. The survey was conducted in a village in Norwegian Lapland where interesting developments in this field were said to be taking place. A class of students at the local Youth School was invited to respond in writing to a series of need situations presented as a tape-recorded projection test. The same test, illustrated with a <b>film-strip,</b> was used as the basis of intensive tape-recorded interviews with selected individual adult villagers. The results of the tests indicated that the subjects tested were not such rare givers nor such cheerful receivers as popular tradition held the Lapps to be. A great variety of circumstances influenced them in their decisions. Sympathy, and a strong sense of obligation to help in some situations, were the main reasons for giving. Decisions to accept or reject help were considerably influenced by the urgency of the need, by the benefits which would result from accepting, and "by the wish and obligation to be independent and self-sufficient. There were wide individual variations in willingness to give and accept help, and in the influence of the circumstances of the test situations on the decisions made. Instead of the expected inverse correlation between giving and accepting, various combinations of willingness to give and to accept were observed which reflected the different personalities and attitudes. It was found that none of the current theories on giving and receiving was sufficient to account for all the attitudes revealed, though each was relevant upon occasion. <p...|$|E
