40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the responses of}} the railway vehicle and track components in terms of contact forces and displacements. The considered vehicle model is a five-DOF pitch-plane lumped parameter quarter car model supported on two-dimensional track systems comprising three layers. The car body is linked with the vehicle bogie through secondary suspension springs and <b>damper</b> <b>elements,</b> which is further linked to the wheels through primary suspension springs and <b>damper</b> <b>elements.</b> In modeling of the track, the rail is considered as an infinitely long beam discretely supported by a series of springs, dampers and masses representing the elasticity and damping effects of the rail pads, ballasts, and subgrades respectively. The non-linear Hertzian contact theory is employed to accomplish the dynamic interactions between the lumped mass vehicle and the continuous rail. The drastic effect of one wheel flat to the other perfect wheel-rail contact point is also taken into account...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{design of a}} magneto-rheological fluid embedded pneumatic vibration isolator (MrEPI) considering practical constraints and optimal performance is proposed. The design procedure basically consists of three steps, i. e. system level design, component level design and practical realization. The system level design involves synthesizing appropriate non-dimensional system parameters of pneumatic spring and MR <b>damper</b> <b>elements</b> based on parameter sensitivity analysis considering requirements for compact and efficient hardware utilization. The component level design involves optimal design of the MR valve by minimizing an objective function in terms of non-dimensional geometric, material and excitation parameters, and guaranteeing required performance in the worst cases. Then practical realization involves determining actual plant parameters from the non-dimensional analysis in system and component level designs with the considerations of practical requirements/constraints. To verify {{the effectiveness of this}} optimization procedure, the semi-active vibration control performance of the optimized MrEPI subject to harmonic disturbances is evaluated, which shows good isolation performance in all tested cases. This study actually provides a systematic method for the optimal analysis and design of all those nonlinear vibration isolators consisting of pneumatic spring and MR <b>damper</b> <b>elements.</b> This is achieved firstly by developing effective sensitivity analysis of dominant design parameters upon the adjustable stiffness and damping capacity irrespective of bulky or small system mass configuration and subsequently via a systematic realization design with the consideration of practical constraints in applications.

40|$|Steam {{turbine rotor}} {{is a very}} {{complicated}} assembly, typically consists of several rotor rows. Due to design limitations and increasing demands on {{the efficiency of the}} steam turbines, it is practically impossible to avoid all of the resonant states. The significant vibrations can occur, for example, due to passing resonance state during turbine start up or run out. In the worst case the turbine operates state is close to the resonance state of the rotor row. This leads to the significant oscillation of the bladed disk, and may results in the blade (or blade to disk joints) high cycle fatigue. These parts are highly loaded components and any cracks are unacceptable. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to damp vibration by using, for example, passive <b>damping</b> <b>elements.</b> The <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> analyzed in this thesis is a strap with an isosceles trapezoidal cross section, which is placed in the circumferential dovetail groove in the blade segmental shrouding. The sliding between the contact surfaces leads to the dissipation of energy which causes decreasing of undesirable vibrations. The main aim is to design the optimal dimensions of the strap cross-section with a view to the most effective damping of vibration for a particular turbine operating state. Considered bladed disk has 54 blades which are coupled in 18 packets by segmental shrouding. The <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> is paced in circumferential dovetail groove created in the shrouding. This type of <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> is suitable especially for damping vibrations in the axial direction and only with the mode shape with the nodal diameters. The modal properties of the bladed disk are influenced by the sliding distance. Since the friction force depends on centrifugal force acting on the <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> and on the angle of the side walls of the strap and groove, the sliding distance can be influenced by the <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> dimensions. During the optimization process the best possible size of middle width, height and angle of <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> cross-section is searched. The strap weight, contact area size and flexural stiffness of <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> can be influenced by these parameters. Their change has also impact {{on the size of the}} contact pressure and thus on the size of relative motion as well. As stated previously, the damping efficiency is influenced by the relative motion between the <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> and shrouding. Numerical simulation in time domain is very time-consuming, especially for systems containing nonlinearities. In order to verify dynamic behavior of the computational model with the passive friction element in numerical simulations, the simplified model is created. The model is created in the ANSYS environment. The main requirement imposed on this model is to have as small number of degrees of freedom as possible, so the time needed to perform the simulation is reduced to a minimum. To satisfy this requirement the simplified model is a cantilever beam with rectangular cross section. The dovetail groove is created in this model in longitudinal direction. In this groove is <b>damping</b> <b>element.</b> In addition to <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> dimensions optimization, the influence of each design variable on model dynamic behavior is studied. The results are verified experimentally. Experiment also shows other interesting results that confirm the <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> influence on the modal characteristics. The gained knowledge is used to optimize the dimensions of the <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> in the model of the bladed disk...|$|R

First, the energy absorption characteristics of <b>damping</b> chamber <b>elements</b> with various gradation combinations and compaction indices were measured in the laboratory using compression testing. The laboratory compression results demonstrated that the optimal gradation combination of <b>damping</b> chamber <b>elements</b> is as follows: the content of fine rubber particles is 10 %, the content of coarse granules is 90 %, and the optimal compaction index is 0. 98. Next, the findings from the laboratory compression-test studies were used to produce <b>damping</b> chamber <b>elements</b> that were applied to a full-scale modern track model in the laboratory.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to suppress resonant vibration is presented by employing a single {{degree of freedom}} transmissibility system which utilises a nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>element.</b> Studies ahve shown that the nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> can reduce the output energy at the driving frequency {{and at the same}} time spread the output signal energy over a wider range of harmonics. It will also be shown that that the reduction becomes larger as the nonlinear damping characteristic gets stronger, and in most cases the power at the harmonics in the output spectrum will be much less if the nonlinear damping characteristic is an odd function. Hence, an odd polynomial nonlinear <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> can be introduced between the incoming signal and the structure of interest to suppress resonant vibration.

Using a simplified model of the stiffness elements of the DVA, it is shown that the two sets of parallel combinations of stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>elements</b> of the DVA with negligibly small moments of inertia effectively act in series, rather than in parallel as in the other case. Furthermore, it is shown that the stiffness and <b>damping</b> <b>elements</b> can be represented as a single stiffness and a single <b>damping</b> <b>element</b> whose properties are frequency dependent.

This work examines the analytical modeling and experimental validation of full-scale beam-column connections constructed utilising Damage Avoidance Design (DAD) principles with un-bonded post-tensioned tendons and rocking interfaces. These test articles also utilise high force-to-volume extrusion-based energy dissipaters to provide supplemental energy dissipation and modify joint hysteretic performance. Independently validated analytical models of both the joint and devices are combined to create a full system model. In particular, analytical modelling is utilised to characterise the damper augmented beam-to-column rocking connections, using a rate-dependent tri-linear compound version of the well-known Menegotto-Pinto rule.
