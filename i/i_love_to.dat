500|$|Virginia is {{also seen}} in Poe's prose. The short story [...] "Eleonora" [...] (1842)which {{features}} a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, {{with whom he}} lives alongside her mothermay also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife {{had just begun to}} show signs of her illness. It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published [...] "The Oblong Box" [...] (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse. The short story [...] "Ligeia", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia. After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, [...] "Metzengerstein", to remove the narrator's line, [...] "I would wish all <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> perish of that gentle disease", a reference to tuberculosis.|$|E

500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E

[...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit."
