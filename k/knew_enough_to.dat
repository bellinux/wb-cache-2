500|$|The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas {{first arrived}} in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in {{with him in a}} flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Known at this time as Yannis Mardas, he found {{employment}} as a television repairman. Dunbar later introduced Mardas to Brian Jones, after Mardas exhibited his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. Dunbar worked with Mardas on the “psychedelic light box” for The Rolling Stones' three-week tour of Europe in 1967, although they were not impressed with the results. Dunbar later said: [...] "He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing. He <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> know how to wind people up and to what extent. He was a fucking TV repairman: Yannis Mardas, none of this 'Magic Alex' shit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|John Masters {{noted in}} one of his autobiographies (The Road Past Mandalay) that Pete Rees was an abstinent (he [...] "spoke softly, never swore, never drank, did not smoke." [...] but also, [...] "always wore a small kind smile"). According to Masters, Rees was a {{polyglot}} and spoke English, Welsh, [...] "Urdu, Marathi, Pushtu, Burmese, and Tamil. Now he asked me to teach him Gurkhali, and soon he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause a look of startled pleasure to cross many a stolid Gurung face." [...] Masters also said of Rees that he had a [...] "rare, personal gentleness and unfailing good manners".|$|E
2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep my mouth shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give yourselves no uneasiness {{about the}} bastille St. John. The English will <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> retire {{from it and}} fall back on the bridge bastilles when they see us coming." [...] She added, {{with a touch of}} sarcasm, [...] "Even a war-council would <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> do that itself." ...|$|R
30|$|We <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{recognise}} {{that our}} {{picture of how}} the global climate system works is very different than how it was viewed even a few years ago. We also <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> recognise that much remains unclear. Here I will briefly note a few intriguing topics for research (see also Sheil and Murdiyarso 2009) before considering some practical aspects.|$|R
5000|$|In his preface Ashmole says of himself, [...] "I must profess I <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hold my tongue, but not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> speak." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Kelly got {{the worst}} of it in every deal he made. [...] When he went from the Boston players' team [...] to the local [...] club [...] he helped that team to make over $100,000 [...] [...] The club at that time was no better than fifth [...] and his {{desertion}} more than anything else gave the finishing blow to the brotherhood [...] [...] Mike was popular wherever he played. [...] The trouble with him was that he had no brain as he himself was concerned. [...] He <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make money for others, but never could make anything for himself. I don’t think that his playing days are over yet, but every club in the league seems inclined to turn him down. [...] Mike has a great many friends in every town where baseball is played and it will be bad policy on the magnates’ [...] part to retire him from the game which he has adorned so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} year, Zhu Di survived the initial assaults by {{superior}} forces under Geng Bingwen (耿炳文) and Li Jinglong (李景龍) thanks to superior tactics and capable Mongol auxiliaries. He also issued numerous justifications for his rebellion, including questionable {{claims to have}} been the son of Empress Ma and bold-faced lies that his father had attempted to name him as the rightful heir, only to be thwarted by bureaucrats scheming to empower Zhu Biao's son. Whether because of this propaganda or for personal motives, Zhu Di began to receive a steady stream of turncoat eunuchs and generals who provided him with invaluable intelligence allowing a hit-and-run campaign against the imperial supply depots along the Grand Canal. By 1402, he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be able to avoid the main hosts of the imperial army while sacking Xuzhou, Suzhou, and Yangzhou. The betrayal of Chen Xuan gave him the imperial army's Yangtze River fleet; the betrayal of Li Jinglong and the prince's half-brother Zhu Hui (朱橞) opened the gates of Nanjing on 13 July. Amid the disorder, the imperial palace quickly caught fire: Zhu Di enabled his own succession by claiming three bodies [...] charred beyond recognition [...] as the Jianwen emperor, his consort, and their son but rumours circulated for decades that the Jianwen Emperor had escaped in disguise as a Buddhist monk.|$|E

50|$|At {{this point}} we {{probably}} <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> try {{to see how we}} explicitly build the decomposition (let's call it D).|$|R
6000|$|Lapham nodded. [...] "Gettysburg. That's my thermometer. If it wa'n't for that, I shouldn't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> come in when it rains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Slipped {{away when}} the blow came up,” {{answered}} the captain. “An’ I hope the mate <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep away,” he added, gravely.|$|R
60|$|He <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give a few directions, which {{revealed}} to poor Mrs. Curtis {{the character of}} the disease.|$|E
60|$|The young gymnast {{was as much}} {{surprised}} as was his tormentor. But he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cling fast to the sill, and not to drop into Daniel Hawkins’ clutches.|$|E
60|$|Several {{days had}} been spent around {{the mouth of}} Santiago Bay, without {{anything}} being brought to light. If the Spanish fleet was within the harbor, it <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep out of sight, that was certain.|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't. He {{inherited}} his money. But he <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{hold on to}} it {{and hire}} other men's brains. He is very conservative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no they escaped; {{they always}} do; but there's never a {{one of them}} that <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fetch out her jewelry with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} do that. And after this I'll <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> lead him around such a bend, instead of taking such a {{dangerous}} chance." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{intoxicated}} as he was, {{when they}} dispersed, he <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> charge the steward--a steady seaman be it remembered--with the present {{safety of the}} ship; and then went below, when he fell directly into another drunken sleep.|$|E
6000|$|I really {{wondered}} {{an instant}} {{how she could}} expect help from such extravagance. [...] "But I thought you just recognised that you do enjoy the sense of your pardonable mistake. You knew something when you <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see you had made it." ...|$|E
60|$|Munro Staton, {{the local}} constable, was much chagrined {{to think that}} he had not had a hand in finding Arnold Baxter, and he at once set out to locate Dan. But Dan Baxter <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> leave the vicinity, {{and that was the last}} heard of him for some time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and we didn't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{come down}} here," [...] added Snap bitterly. [...] "If {{we had come}} we could have caught the boat-stealers redhanded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill Harney {{is a good}} <b>enough</b> guide <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what to do," [...] put in John Barrow. [...] "He {{will pull}} them through somehow--that is, if he <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> remain sober." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if he prints {{all that}} stuff I've told him it's a sure thing that dad will be jumping mad. Didn't you <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> call me off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Myles, briefly, {{and then}} again neither spoke, until by-and-by the Lady Anne came, {{bringing}} the ball. Myles felt {{a great sense of}} relief at that coming, and yet was somehow sorry. Then he took the ball, and <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bow his acknowledgment in a manner neither ill nor awkward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, now, hold on!" [...] the man said, [...] "I've {{got one of}} the cursed {{things in}} here somewhere. I guess it must be in with my watch. No, it's not there either. Wait till I try my coat. If that confounded tailor only <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make a pocket so that a man could get at it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Our force, meaning {{those under}} Commodore Barney's command, numbered, as I have already said, about five hundred, and {{although}} we {{had no knowledge of}} military tactics, we <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> obey our officers {{to the best of our}} ability, which was considerably more than could be said for very many of the troops near at hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{trust your}} brother gets your horses back," [...] said Noel Urner. [...] "It's a pity he won't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> take mine {{away from the}} thieves, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{could see}} the crowd before getting very near and would <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stay at a distance," [...] Neal replied. [...] "I'd {{like to know what}} that statue represents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] I said, [...] "I am {{absolutely}} inexperienced as regards fowls. I just <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> help myself to bread sauce when I see one, but no more." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{unexpected}} turn {{of affairs}} made Dan's heart leap into his throat, {{and he felt}} how imprudent both had been to thus expose themselves in such an {{out of the way}} spot to a man in Stiger's condition. He drew his own pistol, but the half-breed <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> dart out of sight behind a thick clump of bushes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, thus," [...] {{said the}} second. [...] "If he only <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> follow yonder road over the hill, {{he would come}} by-and-by to a stone cross where two roads meet, and there he would find a man sitting. If he would ask it of him, that man would lead him to the garden where the fruit of {{happiness}} grows." ...|$|E
60|$|Kim {{considered}} for a while, tingling with pride. Three years ago {{he would have made}} prompt profit on the situation and gone his way without a thought; but now, the very respect the Jat paid him proved that he was a man. Moreover, he had tasted fever once or twice already, and <b>knew</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> recognize starvation when he saw it.|$|E
5000|$|According to Surgeon General Koop, [...] "Although the {{evidence}} may be slim, we nevertheless <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> conclude that pornography does present {{a clear and}} present danger to American public health".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{knows for}} certain more'n a self-respectin' wolf ought to know," [...] Henry agreed. [...] "A wolf that <b>knows</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{come in with}} the dogs at feedin' time has had experiences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't quite say that. I suppose I do know pretty well. At any rate, I <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} you ought to come. But I must not say what it is." ...|$|R
