5|$|The reserve, located partly along {{a valley}} between the Lesser Himalaya {{in the north}} and the Shivaliks in the south, has a sub-Himalayan belt structure. The upper {{tertiary}} rocks are exposed towards the base of the Shiwalik range and <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> units form broad ridges. Characteristic longitudinal valleys, geographically termed Doons, or Duns can be seen formed along the narrow tectonic zones between lineaments.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone,</b> held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Harding</b> <b>Sandstone</b> is a {{geologic}} formation in Colorado. It preserves fossils {{dating back to}} the Ordovician period.|$|R
50|$|The rock {{outcrops}} of the Teufelsmauer {{are formed}} of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> {{from the various}} epochs of the Upper Cretaceous. The predominantly clayey and limy strata of the Upper Cretaceous are intercalated by <b>harder</b> <b>sandstones</b> such as Neocomian, Involutus and Heidelberg Sandstone, as well as limestones. In addition, quartzitation caused by the ingress of silicic acid has produced extreme hardening of the sandstones, restricted {{to just a few}} metres of the formerly horizontally-oriented strata.|$|R
50|$|The area is {{a popular}} spot for surfing, since {{powerful}} waves from the Atlantic Ocean rise up over rocky reefs formed by <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Table Mountain Group. Wherever the bottom is rocky, the shallower waters are thick with giant kelp forests.|$|R
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone,</b> shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The town is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the High Weald, a ridge of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> that runs across southern England from Hampshire along the borders of Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent—the town's geology is illustrated by the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks (a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its exposed gulls), and the quarries at nearby Langton Green from which sandstone was taken to build houses in Tunbridge Wells. The town is sited {{at the head of a}} valley that runs south-east to Groombridge; like the River Teise, which originates in Tunbridge Wells, the stream in the valley is one of the many tributaries of the River Medway, which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{southwest}} Ancestral Puebloan region, and at Mesa Verde, the best-known {{site for the}} large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, housing, defensive, and storage complexes were built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone,</b> held together and plastered with adobe mortar.|$|E
50|$|The pillar {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Brule clay interlayered with volcanic ash and Arikaree <b>sandstone.</b> The <b>harder</b> <b>sandstone</b> layers {{near the top}} have protected the pillar since it {{broke away from the}} retreating cliff line to the south. Chimney Rock rises approximately 286 ft above its surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|The hill {{owes its}} shape to an {{outlying}} cap of <b>hard</b> Grenoside <b>sandstone</b> that has protected the softer stone beneath from erosion. The slopes below Castle Hill are formed from alternating deposits of shale and <b>harder</b> <b>sandstones</b> {{and form a}} series of slopes and benches. [...] Five coal seams lie within the shales of the lower slopes {{some of which have}} been worked along the hillside, by adits and shafts. Workings are visible in several places and there is also evidence of old quarries that have been infilled.|$|R
50|$|The bedrock {{beneath the}} Paskapoo Slopes and nearby Broadcast Hill and Nose Hill {{consists}} of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> {{that are part}} of the Paskapoo Formation. They were deposited during the Paleocene epoch approximately 62.5 to 58.5 million years ago, on a broad alluvial plain that extended eastward from the Canadian Rocky Mountains.|$|R
25|$|Mount Keira forms {{part of the}} Illawarra {{escarpment}} {{which it}} joins by a high saddle on the back (western) side. It is capped by a westward sloping plateau of relatively <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> ringed on the remaining 3 sides by cliffs. From the cliff base the mountain slopes down to the surrounding foothills and coastal plain. From Wollongong the mountain looks rather flat topped; while from the north it appears part of the escarpment.|$|E
25|$|The hill is an outlier of the North York Moors uplands. It {{is formed}} from {{sandstone}} {{laid down in}} the Middle and Lower Jurassic periods, between 208 and 165 million years ago, which constitutes the youngest sandstone {{to be found in}} any of the National Parks in England and Wales. Its distinctive conical shape {{is the result of the}} hill's <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> cap protecting the underlying shales and clays from erosion by the effects of ice, wind and rain.|$|E
500|$|Mesa Verde's canyons {{were created}} by streams that eroded the <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> that covers the area. This {{resulted}} in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about , the highest elevation at Park Point. [...] The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The {{rocks of}} {{the central part of}} the {{anticline}} include <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones,</b> and these form hills now called the High Weald. The peripheral areas are mostly of softer sandstones and clays and form a gentler rolling landscape, the Low Weald. The Weald-Artois Anticline continues some 40 mi further south-eastwards under the Straits of Dover, and includes the Boulonnais of France.|$|R
50|$|The Edmonton Group {{consists}} of fine-grained sandstones, calcareous sandstones, siltstones, sandy shales and mudstones, bentonitic sandstones and shales, bentonite beds, ironstone concretions, carbonaceous shales and coal seams. <b>Hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> commonly cap mesas, buttes and plateaus where erosion has formed badlands topography, {{as is the}} case for much of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and the Scollard Formation. Coarse-grained sediments are rare in the Edmonton Group.|$|R
50|$|The Teufelsmauer (Devil's Wall) is a rock {{formation}} made of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Upper Cretaceous in {{the northern}} part of the Harz Foreland in central Germany. This wall of rock runs from Blankenburg (Harz) via Weddersleben and Rieder to Ballenstedt. The most prominent individual rocks of the Teufelsmauer have their own names. The Teufelsmauer near Weddersleben is also called the Adlersklippen ("Eagle Crags").|$|R
500|$|On {{the fifth}} day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradziński, the {{geologist}} of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised {{to belong to a}} fairly complete skeleton. Excavation started on the next day, revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to Dalanzadgad; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons.|$|E
2500|$|The world's {{largest oil}} sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the {{deposits}} {{in the two}} countries is generally rather similar. They are vast heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20°API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties. [...] "Unconsolidated" [...] in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{rocks of}} the area are mostly mudstone, {{deposited}} in a deep ocean basin some 450 million years ago. Very few fossils {{are found in the}} rocks because the sediments were deposited in such deep water. Associated locally with the mudstone are beds of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> (turbidites); at Poppit Sands these beds are up to a metre or two thick. Deposited as muds and sands on the ocean floor, they were subsequently squeezed and folded by major earth movements, which changed the mudstones into slates. [...] Excellent examples of these folded rocks can be seen at the western end of Poppit Sands.|$|E
30|$|However, {{studies on}} the {{mechanical}} properties and acoustic emission characteristics of thick <b>hard</b> roof <b>sandstone</b> are scarce. In order to explore the internal cause of dynamic disasters such as the formation of shock, and take corresponding control measures, the mechanical properties and acoustic emission characteristics of the thick <b>hard</b> roof <b>sandstone</b> in the Shendong coal field were studied experimentally {{and the results are}} analyzed and discussed in this paper.|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks of}} {{the central part of}} the {{anticline}} include <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones,</b> and these form hills now called the High Weald. The peripheral areas are mostly of softer sandstones and clays and these form the gentler rolling landscape of Low Weald, of which the Vale of Kent is a part. The Weald-Artois Anticline continues some 65 km further south-eastwards under the Straits of Dover, and includes the Boulonnais of France.|$|R
50|$|The very steep-sided V-shaped valleys {{that are}} typical of the Keuper Uplands are known here as klingen. Such klingen occur in the petrographically <b>harder</b> <b>sandstone</b> beds of the keuper, for example in the Stubensandstein. These rocks are able to resist {{significantly}} the erosion forces (especially side erosion) of water. In less erosion-resistant rocks of the keuper like the clays or marls, the valleys are more deeply carved out so that many wider-profiled valley are formed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the lower Triassic clastic sediments originated from a Variscan source area in northern France with minor local input. Some Alderley Edge conglomerates, consist of material originating from the Pennine block to the east. Breccias with clasts of local origin, are well developed {{on the edges of}} the basin and are interpreted as gravel fans at the mouths of wadis emerging from mountainous areas bordering the depositional basin. Others show long distance river transport by a powerful river system [...] originating in the Armorican Massif. The basal conglomerates are made up of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> which contains angular grains. At Alderley Edge the junction is quite sharp it could be regarded as an unconformity. However interdigitation is found as if to testify against an unconformity. Mappable beds showing all the characteristics of the Upper Mottled Sandstone are found between the two basal beds of the conglomerates.|$|E
2500|$|The Djurid Balud Aboriginal clan {{inhabited}} the nearby area {{for thousands of}} years prior to the European colonisation of Australia. They used the mountain's <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> for making various stone tools, and found shelter in its many gullies and small caves. Following European settlement in the mid-1840s, the Djurid Balud were displaced from the area, leading to the breaking up of the clan. The loss of the resources that the mountain provided, the ravages of European disease, and armed clashes with the settlers were all contributing factors. By the early 1870s, the last of the Djurid Balud had been relocated to mission stations. Some of their descendants still live in the area and there are also a number of archaeological sites nearby. Indeed, a survey of Mount Arapiles in 1992 located no fewer than 42 Aboriginal archaeological sites, including [...] "quarries" [...] for hard stone for implements, scarred trees and rock art sites.|$|E
6000|$|That settles the matter. The pebbles {{could not}} come from Wales; there are no flints there. They {{could not have been}} made before the chalk; for out of the chalk they came; and the only {{explanation}} which is left to us, I believe, is, that over the tops of the chalk downs; over our heads where we stand now, there once stretched layers of sand and gravel, [...] "Tertiary strata" [...] as I have been calling them to you; and among them layers of this same <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{traditional}} {{method of}} manufacture {{is the use of}} bow drills made with hard white quartz points for drilling sacred objects from stone. One technique uses moistened rawhide strips rolled in crushed white quartz and stretched with a bow handle to shape and rough the pipes. Pipe bowls may also be shaped with <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones,</b> then polished with water and sanded with progressively finer and finer abrasive grit and animal hide, finally being rubbed with fat or other oils to complete polishing.|$|R
50|$|Cumberland Mountain {{is part of}} the Cumberland Overthrust Sheet or {{block and}} is the {{northern}} limb of the Powell Valley Anticline, a ramp anticline. The ridge exists because <b>hard</b> Lee-type <b>sandstones</b> of Early Pennsylvanian Age crop out along this line. Softer rocks have been eroded away, leaving the resistant sandstones to form a ridge. The southwestern terminus of Cumberland Mountain is marked by the northwest-trending Jacksboro Fault, a lateral ramp fault (part of the Pine Mountain Thrust Fault). The northwestern terminus is located near Norton, Virginia where the <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> dip below the surface as the axis of the Powell Valley anticline plunges to the northeast. The various gaps in Cumberland Mountain are caused by rock weaknesses at cross-cutting faults or joints. For example, Cumberland Gap was caused by erosion along the cross-cutting Rocky Face Fault.|$|R
500|$|The {{walls are}} built of {{mountain}} limestone faced with <b>hard</b> red <b>sandstone.</b> They are [...] high, [...] thick {{at the base}} just above the curve, and [...] thick at the top.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{is it not}} {{plain that}} if such trees as that sunk, their bark would be turned into lignite, and at last into coal, while their insides would be silted up with mud and sand? Thus a core or pillar of <b>hard</b> <b>{{sandstone}}</b> would be formed, which might do to the collier of the future what they are too apt to do now in the Newcastle and Bristol collieries. For there, when the coal is worked out below, the sandstone stems--"coal-pipes" [...] as the colliers call them--in {{the roof of the}} seam, having no branches, and nothing to hold them up but their friable bark of coal, are but too apt to drop out suddenly, killing or wounding the hapless men below.|$|E
60|$|Punta Alta is {{situated}} about thirty miles higher {{up on the}} northern side of this same bay: it consists of a small plain, between twenty and thirty feet in height, cut off on the shore by a line of low cliffs about a mile in length, represented in Figure 15 with its vertical scale necessarily exaggerated. The lower bed (A) is more extensive than the upper ones; it consists of stratified gravel or conglomerate, cemented by calcareo- arenaceous matter, and is divided by curvilinear layers of pinkish marl, of which some are precisely like tosca-rock, and some more sandy. The beds are curvilinear, owing to the action of currents, and dip in different directions; they include an extraordinary number of bones of gigantic mammifers and many shells. The pebbles are of considerable size, and are of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone,</b> and of quartz, {{like that of the}} Ventana: there are also a few well-rounded masses of tosca-rock.|$|E
60|$|Turning now to {{the points}} which more {{immediately}} concern us. Worm- castings were observed on the floors {{of several of the}} rooms, in one of which the tesselation was unusually perfect. The tesserae here consisted of little cubes of <b>hard</b> <b>sandstone</b> of about 1 inch, several of which were loose or projected slightly above the general level. One or occasionally two open worm-burrows were found beneath all the loose tesserae. Worms have also penetrated the old walls of these ruins. A wall, which had just been exposed to view during the excavations then in progress, was examined; it was built of large flints, and was 18 inches in thickness. It appeared sound, but when the soil was removed from beneath, the mortar in the lower part was found to be so much decayed that the flints fell apart from their own weight. Here, {{in the middle of the}} wall, at a depth of 29 inches beneath the old floor and of 49.5 inches beneath the surface of the field, a living worm was found, and the mortar was penetrated by several burrows.|$|E
50|$|The {{town has}} large red {{sandstone}} mountains on three sides. Its rock, from the Permian period, about 260 million years ago, {{is considered the}} <b>hardest</b> <b>sandstone</b> in the world, and has a unique red or salmon color. While E. S. Lyon established the quarrying business in the town, his business was not a big success, and he left for California. Numerous owners succeeded him and developed various successful quarries over time. Murphy, Brodie, Ohline, Loukonen and Vasquez {{are among the most}} noteworthy owners. A railroad built to the town in the late 19th century gave the quarries a significant boost.|$|R
50|$|The Southern Gulf Islands consist {{mainly of}} former seabed sediments {{crumpled}} and gradually thrust upward by tectonic plate movement between 55 to 42 million years ago. Subsequent periods of glaciation scraped away topsoil {{and some of}} the bedrock. During the peak of the Fraser Glaciation, 30,000 to 11,000 years ago, Gabriola was covered with ice up to 2 km thick. Though melting glaciers left deposits of sand, gravel, and boulders, the main rocks exposed on Gabriola's surface are sandstone and shale. Differential erosion of relatively soft shales and relatively <b>hard</b> <b>sandstones</b> helped create cliffs, points, and bays along Gabriola's shoreline.|$|R
5000|$|The Elk Mountains {{are a small}} {{range of}} {{mountains}} in western South Dakota, forming the southwest portion of the Black Hills {{as part of its}} west-dipping monocline. They are geologically distinct from the Black Hills, {{on the other side of}} a [...] "racetrack" [...] region of red stone. The ridge of the Elk Mountains is formed of <b>harder</b> <b>sandstones.</b> The east face of the Elk Mountains is a 300 to 800 ft high escarpment, but the west portion falls slowly and features many canyons. The mountains are about 3800 ft higher than the low prairie hills to their west.|$|R
