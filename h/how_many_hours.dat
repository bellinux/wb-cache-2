25|$|The {{public water}} supply system in Greater Beirut {{receives}} its water from the Jeita springs (50 million m3/year) as well as well fields in the Damour region (30 million m3/year). The Jeita spring {{is the source of}} drinking water for about 1.5 million Lebanese. Water is treated in the Dbaiye water treatment plant north of the city with a capacity of 430,000m3/day (157 million m3/year). Besides the public network, around 1,000 mostly private wells are scattered in the area of Beirut. Their depth varies between 50 and 300m and their average individual discharge is 35 liters/second. Total water supply from these wells could be higher than through the {{public water supply}}, depending on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> the pumps run. Overpumping from wells in the Beirut area has led to seawater intrusion into aquifers.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E

500|$|Blue's Clues was {{developed}} during a transitional period for children's television. In 1990, Congress {{had passed the}} Children's Television Act, which required networks and TV stations to devote {{a portion of their}} programming to children's shows, but the legislation did not specify <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> of programming broadcasters were required to air. It set no guidelines or criteria for educational programs and had no provisions for enforcement. According to author Diane Tracy in her 2002 book, Blue's Clues for Success, [...] "The state of children's television was pretty dismal." [...] Since the late 1960s, PBS {{was one of the few}} sources for children's educational television programming in the U.S., and most other U.S. children's TV shows were violent and created for the purpose of selling toys. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled in 1997 that the commercial broadcast networks had to air educational children's programs for a minimum of three hours per week. The cable network Nickelodeon, which had been airing programs for six- to twelve-year-olds, was not legally bound by this legislation but complied with it anyway many years before the laws and regulations were passed.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{episode was}} shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed {{frequently}} during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were {{in the community of}} Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E

McGregor also wanted to pursue modelling opportunities in Europe and he explained, [...] "It's been tough [...] I didn't realise <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> were involved, and I had to knock back so many modelling jobs."

[...] Mark's departure unfolded during a real time episode, which was broadcast on 22 June 2011. Mark was forced to go into witness protection after he was stalked and threatened for exposing corruption within the police force. In a twist to the storyline, Mark was later said to have been killed. McGregor believed Mark could return in the future, saying [...] "There have been plenty of other characters who've come back from the dead - but that's not to say I'd want to.

2500|$|As wages {{increase}} {{above the}} subsistence level (discussed below), {{there are two}} considerations affecting a worker's choice of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>hours</b> to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or incentive effect. With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the higher wage than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen {{because it is more}} affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or [...] "leisure") is a normal good and so people want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend.|$|E

For this competition, HouseGuests were required to hang upside down on rocking pendulums; when a player fell off of their pendulum, they were eliminated from the competition. HouseGuests were also eliminated if their torso was raised above a bar located on the pendulum. During the competition, a banner flew over the house which referred to Amber and Eric as being [...] "liars". This banner led Daniele to realize that Eric had voted to evict Kail the previous two weeks, and led to Daniele to begin turning against him. Daniele was the eventual winner of the Head of Household competition. During the competition, Daniele had promised Kail safety for the week in exchange for dropping from the competition. On Day 35, Daniele chose to nominate Jen and Kail for eviction, with the hopes of backdooring Eric that week.
