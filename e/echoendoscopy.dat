40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Echoendoscopy</b> {{is a mixed}} {{technique}} {{which adds}} the advantages of endoscopy to those of transabdominal ultrasonography through an endoscope with transductor in its distal extremity, allowing {{for the evaluation of}} the abdominal organs reached by the endoscope and in contact with the intestinal wall. AIM: To verify the positivity rate of the <b>echoendoscopy</b> with puncture with thin needle (EEPTN) or (EE-PAF) in solid pancreatic mass based on the technique used in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit of Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation - cohort study - of 138 patients who were submitted to <b>echoendoscopy</b> through aspiration puncture between May 2004 and June 2007. The data were collected through the medical charts present in the medical files of Hospital das Clínicas (Clinical Hospital) of the University of São Paulo, having as inclusion criterion the presence of solid pancreatic mass in computerized tomography and as exclusion criterion the presence of non solid pancreatic tumor. The routine technique was the one used in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit focusing the following variables: mass characteristics (size, location, presence of peripancreatic lymph node, presence of lymph node in celiac trunk); number of punctures to obtain microfragment for cytology, and experience of the professional in charge. The equipment used was an <b>echoendoscopy</b> device model Olympus EUS (EYES) Exera EU - C 60, with electronic sectorial transductor and 22 gauges Wilson-Cook needles. RESULTS: Seventy six (55, 4 %) male patients and 61 (44. 5 %) female were enrolled. Age ranged from 16 to 87 years and means 59, 9 years. The lesions were cephalic in 94 (68, 1 %). Mass larger than 4 cm had a higher percentage of positivity reaching 40 %, but lesions smaller than 2 cm had a percentage of 43 % of inconclusive. Microfragments were obtained in 100 % of the positive cases and only 73, 1 % when negative (P= 0, 004). There was no statistic difference regarding the experience of the endoscopy professional. Only 80 patients had the number of punctures written down and it was noticed that there is better performance as the number of punctures was increased. The definitive histopathologycal diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasia occurred in only 41 (29, 7 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding mass characteristics, when larger is the mass, larger is the positivity of the method; the location didn't correlate with higher positivity; when the lymph nodes were present, there was a tendency to positivity; concerning the number of punctures, the higher number, higher positivity; in relationship to the professional experience in endoscopy, {{there was no difference in}} the rate of positivity of the puncture of the solid pancreatic mass...|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{oesophageal}} cancers {{are diagnosed}} {{at an early}} stage in less than 10 % of the cases. They are superficial tumours whose invasion is limited to the mucosae and the submucosa. Synchronous node invasion is the most important prognosis factor. Oesophagectomy is the benchmark treatment. Nowadays, endoscopic resection is a validated curative therapeutic alternative. Accurate endoscopic evaluation using chemical or virtual colouring as well as an <b>echoendoscopy,</b> followed by an expert pathological review, must be conducted beforehand. It can be realised for good prognosis tumours after evaluation of the synchronous node invasion or its risk.

40|$|AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade {{vascular}} tumor {{that occurs}} in association with human herpesvirus 8 infection. Here we report {{the case of a}} 21 -year-old male with recently diagnosed cutaneous KS who presented with rectal bleeding and anal pruritus. Initial endoscopic evaluation was nondiagnostic. CT imaging showed diffuse lymphadenopathy including perirectal involvement which was suspicious for metastatic KS. <b>Echoendoscopy</b> with needle biopsies and EchoBrush sampling of the lymph nodes revealed spindle cells confirming metastatic KS. Treatment was initiated with liposomal doxorubicin resulting in rapid improvement of the skin lesions. After treatment completion, repeat CT imaging showed improved lymphadenopathy. No further rectal bleeding or perianal pruritus was reported.

40|$|Endoscopic {{treatment}} of superficial gastric cancer {{has been reported}} to be effective by many Japanese teams. In this study, the Nd:YAG laser was used to treat superficial gastric carcinoma in inoperable Caucasian patients with the aim of obtaining a complete response, i. e., disappearance of the lesion endoscopically and biopsy specimens negative for cancer. Eighteen patients unsuitable for surgery with various endoscopic patterns of superficial gastric cancer were treated with the Nd:YAG laser. The endoscopic pattern was type I in 4 patients, type II in 10 (5 type IIa, 1 type IIb, 2 type IIc, 2 mixed IIa + IIc), and type III in 4. Staging by <b>echoendoscopy</b> was performed in 11 patients (T 1 N 0). Nd:YAG laser destruction of the gastric tumor was performed in all cases, with a mean of 4. 4 laser sessions per patient. Tumor response was assessed by endoscopy and biopsy. Follow-up averaged 33 +/- 23 (SD) months. Five patients died of diseases unrelated to gastric cancer. An initial complete response was obtained in 16 (89 %) patients after a mean of 1. 7 laser sessions; histologic evidence of cancer persisted in 2 patients during the entire follow-up period. Among patients with an initial complete response, recurrence was observed in 2. One of them was successfully re-treated. At the end of the follow-up period, 14 (77. 7 %) of the 18 patients had a complete tumoral response; only 4 patients had histologic evidence of cancer. In 3 of these 4 patients, pretherapeutic echoendoscopic staging had not been performed. Among the 14 patients exhibiting a complete response, 3 had negative biopsy results more than 5 years after diagnosis. No complications occurred. In gastric cancer classified as T 1 N 0 on the basis of pretherapeutic <b>echoendoscopy,</b> a high tumor response rate and even 5 -year disease-free survival can be obtained with endoscopic Nd:YAG laser treatment. Endoscopic laser destruction thus appears to be a valuable therapeutic alternative to surgery in inoperable patients with superficial gastric cancer...|$|E
40|$|Topics {{related with}} {{endoscopic}} ultrasound (EUS) made up considerable portion among many invited lectures presented in International Digestive Endoscopy Network 2012 meeting. While the scientific programs {{were divided into}} the fields of upper gastrointestinal (UGI), lower gastrointestinal, and pancreato-biliary (PB) categories, UGI and PB parts mainly dealt with EUS related issues. EUS diagnosis in subepithelial lesions, estimation of the invasion depth of early gastrointestinal cancers with EUS, and usefulness of EUS in esophageal varices were discussed in UGI sessions. In the PB part, pancreatic cystic lesions, EUS-guided biliopancreatic drainage, EUS-guided tis-sue acquisition, and improvement of diagnostic yield in indeterminate biliary lesions by using intraductal ultrasound were discussed. Advanced techniques such as contrast-enhanced EUS, EUS elastography and forward-viewing <b>echoendoscopy</b> were also discussed.

40|$|Carcinoid {{tumors are}} {{classified}} {{according to their}} embryologic origin, {{that might be the}} foregut (stomach, duodenum, biliary tree and also lung, thymus, thyroid), the midgut (ileum, right colon) and the hindgut (left colon and rectum). The clinical picture of these lesions is varia‐ ble, evidencing completely asymptomatic cases, symptoms due to complications (acute appendicitis, peritonitis, obstructions or hemorrhages) or sudden apparition of car‐ cinoid syndromes. The diagnosis includes urinary 5 – HIAA, chromogranine A dosage and Ki‐ 67 expression, as well as localising studies, such as <b>echoendoscopy,</b> video‐ capsule and enteroscopy, CT, MRI, selective abdominal angiography, somatostatin‐receptor‐scintigraphy (Octre‐ oscan, SRI). Coronal contrast‐enhanced CT or MRI angio‐ gram can evaluate the mesenteric vessels spread before surgery. Upper endoscopy or/and colonoscopy can be performed to detect foregut or hindgut lesions. The treat‐ ment is based on surgery and other removal techniques, such as cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation, tradi‐ tional drugs: streptozocin, 5 ‐fluorouracyl, doxorubicin, cyclophos phamide, mitomicycin, metrotrexate together with somatostatin analogs; the future belongs to radionu‐ clide‐radiopeptide therapy...|$|E
40|$|Ramkaji Baniya, Sunil Upadhaya, Seetharamprasad Madala, Subash Chandra Subedi, Tabrez Shaik Mohammed, Ghassan Bachuwa Hurley Medical Center, Michigan State University, Flint, MI, USA Abstract: The {{failure rate}} of {{endoscopic}} retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary cannulation is approximately 6 %– 7 % in cases of obstructive jaundice. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is the procedure of choice in such cases. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EGBD) is a novel technique that allows biliary drainage by <b>echoendoscopy</b> and fluoroscopy using a stent from the biliary tree to the gastrointestinal tract. Information in PubMed, Scopus, clinicaltrials. gov and Cochrane review were analyzed to obtain studies comparing EGBD and PTBD. Six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Technical (odds ratio (OR) : 0. 34; confidence interval (CI) 0. 10 – 1. 14; p= 0. 05) and clinical (OR: 1. 48; CI 0. 46 – 4. 79; p= 0. 51) success rates {{were not statistically significant}} between the EGBD and PTBD groups. Mild adverse events were nonsignificantly different (OR: 0. 36; CI 0. 10 – 1. 24; p= 0. 11) but not the moderate-to-severe adverse events (OR: 0. 16; CI 0. 08 – 0. 32; p≤ 0. 00001) and total adverse events (OR: 0. 34; CI 0. 20 – 0. 59; p≤ 0. 0001).

40|$|Background/Aims: It {{has been}} {{recently}} reported that celiac ganglia {{can be identified}} by linear-array endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Still, {{there has been no}} report on the detection rate of celiac ganglia with radial scanning EUS. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the detection rate of celiac ganglia by radial scanning <b>echoendoscopy</b> during a routine examination. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 57 consecutive patients (23 men, 34 women; mean age 54 years, range 21 - 78 years) who were referred for EUS examination from September 2006 to December 2006. EUS was performed using a radial scanning echoendoscope. The size, location and EUS appearance of the celiac ganglia were recorded for each patient. Results: Celiac ganglia were identified in 51 out of 57 patients (89. 4 %). They were identified at the left side of the celiac trunk and aorta and between the celiac artery and the left adrenal gland. They appeared as hypoechoic, oblong or lobulated structures, often with an irregular edge, and they often contained a hyperechoic focus or strand. The mean size was 18 mm by 4 mm.

40|$|Non-functional retroperitoneal paragangliom {{is a rare}} tumour. They are usully {{asymptomatic}} until attainning {{a remarkable}} size and discovered incidentally. We present two clinical cases. Case 1 A 54 year old man with right abdominal pain referred to our department. Blood pressure and others parameters were normal. Abdominal CT scan and RM revealed a ring-enhanced retroperitoneal encapsulated mass 4 x 3 cm in diameter located between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and aorta compressing the IVC. Total laparoscopic resection of the tumour was performed without complications. The istology revealeded an extra-adrenal paraganglioma. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin, chromogranin A and S 100 protein. The patient is desease-free after one year. Case 2 A retroperitoneal rigth, hypervascularized mass of 7 x 5 cm in diameter was found incidentally in a 74 -year-old asymptomatic man during a screening echography. CT and MR imaging confirmed a homogeneous, encapsulated mass of about 10 cm in size, with necrotic central area, located between the right renal vein and the IVC deplacing frontally the duodenum. <b>Echoendoscopy</b> with fine needle biopsy of the mass was done without diagnosis. Total resection of the mass was performed through a transabdominal approach. It was diagnosed an extra-adrenal paraganglioma with low grade. Immunohistochemically was similar to other case.

40|$|Background and objective: No nation-wide {{epidemiological}} {{study on the}} incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis (CP) had been thus far carried out in Spain. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence and incidence of CP, {{as well as to}} determine the diagnostic and therapeutic criteria used in Spanish pancreas units. Methods: An observarional, descriptive study of hospital pancreas units in Spain. CP-related epidemiology, etiology, manifestations, diagnostic tests, functional complications, and treatments were all assessed using a structured questionnaire. Overall results were estimated by weighting cases in each site. Results: Information was collected from six pancreas units with a sample frame of 1, 900, 751 inhabitants. Overall prevalence was 49. 3 cases per 10 (5) population (95 % CI, 46 to 52) and incidence was 5. 5 cases per 10 (5) inhabitant-years (95 % CI, 5. 4 to 5. 6). Most common etiologies included tobacco and alcoholism, which were associated with three in every four cases. The most prevalent symptoms were recurring pain (48. 8 %) and chronic abdominal pain (30. 6 %). The most widely used diagnostic method was <b>echoendoscopy</b> (79. 8 %), CT (computerized tomography) (58. 7 %), and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) /MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) (55. 9 %). Most prevalent morphologic findings included calcifications (35 %) and pseudocysts (27 %). Exocrine (38. 8 %) and endocrine (35. 2 %) pancreatic insufficiency had both a similar frequency. Treatments used were rather heterogeneous among sites, with enzyme replacement therapy (40. 7 %) and insulin (30. 9 %) being most commonly used.

40|$|Background: Preoperative radiologic {{localization}} of insulinomas often fails {{because of}} the small size of these tumors. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can localize insulinomas in up to 80 % of the cases. the aim {{of this study was to}} compare EUS and computed tomography (CT) diagnostic accuracy for insulinomas,Methods: We reviewed medical records from 12 patients (10 women) with a biochemical diagnosis of hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinism from 1 university hospital and 1 community hospital. A diagnosis of insulinoma was ultimately made in all cases and before surgery the patients underwent abdominal US, spiral CT and EUS in an attempt to precisely localize the tumor. Surgery was considered the standard for tumor localization. Results: Ten tumors were benign (83. 3 %) and 2 were malignant (16. 7 %). the overall sensitivity of EUS in identifying insulinomas was 83. 3 % compared with 16. 7 % for CT. Tumors not detected by EUS had a mean size of 0. 75 cm, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration was possible in only 3 patients, with a positive cytologic diagnosis in 2 (66. 6 %). Tumors located in the head end body of the pancreas were identified by EUS in all patients, but those located in the tail were diagnosed in only 50 % of the cases. Conclusions: EUS is superior to spiral CT and should replace it for the detection of pancreatic insulinomas, EUS identification depends on the site and size of the tumor.

40|$|Solid pseudopapillary {{neoplasm}} of {{the pancreas}} is an uncommon but distinctive pancreatic neoplasm with low metastatic potential [1]. Therefore, whenever feasible, an organ-preserving operation should be performed. As previously reported, women with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas {{may be best}} treated by more conservative procedures [2]. Recently, laparoscopic pancreatic resections became more common and are being performed in highly specialized centers. There are only six cases of laparoscopic resection for solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas published in the English literature and, to our knowledge, laparoscopic resection of uncinate process of the pancreas has never been reported [3 - 6]. This video demonstrates {{the technical aspects of}} a totally laparoscopic resection of the uncinate process of the pancreas in a patient with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm. A 26 -year-old woman with a 4 -cm solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasm was referred for surgical treatment. According to preoperative <b>echoendoscopy,</b> there was a safe margin between neoplasm and main pancreatic duct. The patient was placed in supine position with the surgeon standing between her legs. Four trocars, one 10 -mm and three 5 -mm, were used. At inspection, the inferior vena cava, transverse colon, duodenum, and pancreas are clearly identified. A Kocher maneuver was performed with complete exposure of pancreatic head and uncinate process. The uncinate process was dissected from the superior mesenteric vein and venous branches were divided between metallic clips or by use of laparoscopic coagulation shears (LCS; Ethicon Endo Surgery Industries, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Blood supply of the duodenum was preserved by ligature of small pancreatic branches from inferior pancreatoduodenal artery. Transection of pancreatic parenchyma was performed using laparoscopic coagulation shears, which is an effective tool for cutting the pancreas [7, 8]. Surgical specimen was removed through a suprapubic incision inside a retrieval bag. A hemostatic absorbable tissue (Surgicel; Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was placed in the cutting pancreatic surface, and one round 19 F Blake abdominal drain (Ethicon) was left in place. Operative time was 180 minutes and blood loss estimated in 40 ml with no blood transfusion. Hospital stay was 4 days. The patient did not have postoperative pancreatitis or pancreatic leakage, and the abdominal drain was removed on the tenth postoperative day. Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreas with free surgical margins. The patient was well and asymptomatic 2 months after the procedure.
