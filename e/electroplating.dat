5|$|Cadmium <b>electroplating,</b> {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the <b>electroplating</b> process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium <b>electroplating</b> processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide emulsion (Sc-CO 2 -E) on the smooth and microhardness of nickel film <b>electroplated</b> using Watts bath was studied in this paper. Morphology of nickel film <b>electroplated</b> with Sc-CO 2 -E was found much uniform.

A increasing of microhardness was found for nickel film <b>electroplated</b> through Sc-CO 2 -E when increasing experimental pressure from 12 to 18 MPa, and the smooth of nickel film be promoted.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Electroplated</b> Cr, Ni and Cu {{were used}} as {{interlayer}} for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond coating on WC–Co cemented carbide cutting tools. The <b>electroplated</b> interlayers were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The CVD diamond coatings were studied by SEM and Raman Scattering Spectroscopy (Raman). The experimental results {{show that there is}} diffusion bonded interface between <b>electroplated</b> layer and WC-Co substrate after H plasma treatment, the bond between <b>electroplated</b> layers and WC-Co substrate changes from mechanical bond to metallurgical bond and the adhesion becomes stronger. <b>Electroplated</b> Cr interlayer forms new phases of Cr 3 C 2 and Cr 7 C 3 under CVD conditions, while <b>electroplated</b> Ni and Cu interlayers do not form carbides under CVD conditions. Cr carbides have good chemical compatibility to diamond, and they are propitious to diamond nucleation and growth during the deposition period. The diamond crystal microstructure, diamond quality and adhesion on Cr interlayer are better than those on <b>electroplated</b> Ni and Cu interlayers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Monolayer diamond {{tools are}} {{fabricated}} by brazing {{and used in}} machining of dental ceramics in this paper. The morphology, grinding ratio, wear and grinding force of the brazed diamond tools are investigated in comparison {{with that of the}} <b>electroplated</b> ones. The results show that the brazed alloy forms a hill-like structure around the diamond grits, and the protrusion of the brazed diamond grits is higher than that of the <b>electroplated</b> one. The grinding ratio of the brazed diamond tool is higher than that of the <b>electroplated</b> one. Many pull-off diamond grit pits in the <b>electroplated</b> tool and only few micro-crack diamond grits of the brazed tool are observed after grinding.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} develop the high-efficiency and {{precision}} machining technique of TiCp/Ti– 6 Al– 4 V particulate reinforced titanium matrix composites (PTMCs), high-speed grinding experiments were conducted using the single-layer <b>electroplated</b> cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheel and brazed CBN wheel, respectively. The comparative grinding performance was studied in terms of grinding force, grinding temperature, grinding-induced surface features and defects. The results display that the grinding forces and grinding temperature obtained with the brazed CBN wheel are always lower than those with the <b>electroplated</b> CBN wheel. Though the voids and microcracks are the dominant grinding-induced surface defects, the brazed CBN wheel produces less surface defects compared to the <b>electroplated</b> wheel according to the statistical analysis results. The maximum materials removal rate with the brazed CBN wheel {{is much higher than}} that with the <b>electroplated</b> one. All above indicate that the single-layer brazed CBN super-abrasive wheel is more suitable for high-speed grinding of PTMCs than the <b>electroplated</b> counterpart...|$|R

40|$|Nickel based {{coatings}} were {{deposited on}} copper substrates by two different sputtering techniques from a nickel alloy based target. The substrates used were commercially available copper based substrates for low duty electrical contacts. The coatings were analyzed and evaluated as copper diffusion barriers for electrical contact applications. In addition {{two types of}} commercially available <b>electroplated</b> nickel coatings (referred to as type A <b>electroplated</b> coatings and type B <b>electroplated</b> coatings) were characterized for comparison. The Technique I sputtered coatings were deposited using three different substrate bias voltages and two different working gas pressures. The Technique II coatings were deposited using two different substrate bias voltages and two different working gas pressures. All sputtered coatings were deposited at a temperature of 200 ° C. The quality of the barriers was investigated by analyzing their composition, microstructure, stress, mechanical properties, and surface roughness. The results show that sputtered coatings have polycrystalline structures while the two plated films had (200) orientation and (111) orientation. Both plated coatings contained impurities that originate from chemicals used in the plating baths. The surface of the sputtered coatings reflects the substrate surface, while the <b>electroplated</b> samples on the same substrate (type A coatings) show a smooth mirror like surface and the type B <b>electroplated</b> coatings show a rough surface. Technique II sputtered coatings showed the highest hardness {{in the amount of}} 13 GPa, followed by <b>electroplated</b> type A coatings with a hardness of about 9 GPa while the Technique I coatings showed hardness of 6 - 8 GPa. All sputtered coatings exhibited compressive stress while the <b>electroplated</b> type A coatings exhibited tensile stress of almost twice the magnitude. In this study it is shown that sputtered nickel based coatings sputtered nickel based coatings are a promising more environmental friendly alternative to <b>electroplated</b> nickel coatings...|$|R

The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium.
