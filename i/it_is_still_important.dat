5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important.</b> The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} may occur during the campaign, for example {{as a consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the middle or upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to side with the rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations. While religion no longer plays a central role (as in Medieval II: Total War), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in influencing diplomatic relations between nations.|$|E
25|$|Taro was {{consumed}} by the early Romans {{in much the same}} way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable colocasia. The Roman cookbook Apicius mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to note the Taro because when the Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Taro has remained popular in the Canary Islands. Recently there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.|$|E
50|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} site is Cempoala which {{during the height}} of the Totonacs, was the most <b>important</b> city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> when the Spanish arrived, but it became mostly abandoned afterwards.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} 9th century AD the Cyclades were harassed by Arab raiders, though how Milos fared {{at this time}} is unclear. Milos was {{mentioned}} in a Byzantine chrysobull of 1198, which shows <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to the Byzantines.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} Byzantine period, Edessa became {{the centre of}} {{intellectual}} life within the Syriac Orthodox Church. As such it also became the centre for the translation of Ancient Greek philosophy into Syriac, which provided a stepping stone for the subsequent translations into Arabic. When the Crusades arrived, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> enough to tempt a side-expedition after the Siege of Antioch.|$|R
25|$|Silver nitrate is {{currently}} unregulated in water sources by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, {{if more than}} 1 gram of silver is accumulated in the body, a condition called argyria may develop. Argyria is a permanent cosmetic condition in which the skin and internal organs turn a blue-gray color. The United States Environmental Protection Agency {{used to have a}} maximum contaminant limit for silver in water until 1990, when it was determined that argyria did not impact the function of any affected organs. Argyria is more often associated with the consumption of colloidal silver solutions rather than with silver nitrate, since it is only used at extremely low concentrations to disinfect the water. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to be wary before ingesting any sort of silver-ion solution.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{gas masks}} are quite safe {{and do not}} use asbestos, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to be careful when using a modern gas mask. Typically, masks using 40mm {{connections}} are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so new in-box [...] "modern type" [...] masks can be cracked and leak. Also, the U.S C2 canister (black) was shown to contain hexavalent chromium: the studies by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps showed that the levels in the filter were acceptable, but imply caution when using, {{as it is a}} carcinogen.|$|E

2500|$|Although periapical {{changes will}} be in {{response}} to pulpal changes {{the majority of the}} time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to determine the disease process sequence. [...] When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or furcation radiolucency. [...] This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and alveolar bone. [...] A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the clinician off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic. [...] Similarly, a periodontal abscess may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not. [...] Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or bone grafting techniques are planned.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{travel and}} the other methods of travel which have made global {{interaction}} easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the BCG vaccine was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and miliary TB in childhood. [...] But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are rifampicin and isoniazid. [...] There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB. [...] The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant TB {{is also known as}} [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis." [...] "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of [...] "second-line" [...] antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>important</b> to put in the effort to help and treat patients with [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] in poor countries.|$|E

In {{this day and age}} when everything is uncertain, we should all think about what to value in life and how to coexist with others." [...] On his narrative intentions Oshii comments: [...] "I had a bigger budget than for Ghost in the Shell. I also had more time to prepare it.

50|$|Finally, Mechanical Aptitude (MA) is a low-priority stat, and {{generally}} receives left-over points after the player has already reached their chosen levels of Tactics, Clout and Education.
