5|$|Peter is {{disappointed}} since Francis did {{not care}} about him – so he gives up drinking and does crack instead. Brian notices this, and tells Peter that crack {{is not a good}} substitute for drinking. As a result, Peter sees a <b>hypnotherapist,</b> who helps him discover that Francis was not his biological father. When Peter goes to his mom, Thelma Griffin, about it, she reveals that she had an affair with an Irish man named Mickey McFinnigan and that Mickey is Peter's biological father.|$|E
5|$|Scully's sister Melissa urges {{her to see}} a <b>hypnotherapist</b> {{to recover}} lost {{memories}} of her abduction. Scully heads there, but becomes scared and stops the session. Returning home, Scully finds Skinner leaving her apartment and driving off; he later denies being there. Mulder, recovered from the Blessing Way ritual, is told by Albert that he cannot bathe or change clothes for four days. Scully heads to Boston to attend Bill's funeral, where she introduces herself to Mulder's mother, Teena. At the cemetery, Scully is approached by a Syndicate member known as the Well-Manicured Man, who warns her that {{she is about to}} be killed, either by a pair of assassins or by someone she knows. Mulder goes to Massachusetts and questions Teena about an old photo of his father standing with {{the other members of the}} Syndicate in front of a mysterious building.|$|E

25|$|Erickson is {{most famous}} as a <b>hypnotherapist,</b> but his {{extensive}} research into and experience with hypnosis {{led him to}} develop an effective therapeutic technique. Many of these techniques are not explicitly hypnotic, but they are extensions of hypnotic strategies and language patterns. Erickson recognised that resistance to trance resembles resistance to change, and developed his therapeutic approach with that awareness.|$|E
25|$|Reddy {{announced}} her retirement from performing in 2002, giving her farewell performance with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. That same year, she moved from her longtime residence in Santa Monica, California {{back to her}} native Australia {{to spend time with}} her family, living first on Norfolk Island, before taking up residence in Sydney. She also earned a degree in clinical hypnotherapy and neuro-linguistic programming. She was a practising clinical <b>hypnotherapist</b> and Patron of the Australian Society of Clinical Hypnotherapists.|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff {{wrote that}} he {{supported}} himself during his travels with odd jobs and trading schemes (one of which he described as dyeing hedgerow birds yellow and selling them as canaries). On his reappearance, {{as far as the}} historical record is concerned, the ragged wanderer had transformed into a well-heeled businessman. His only autobiographical writing concerning this period is Herald of Coming Good, a work, if anything, even less reliable than Meetings. In it, he mentions acting as <b>hypnotherapist</b> specialising in the cure of addictions and using people as guinea pigs for his methods. It is also speculated that during his travels, he was engaged in a certain amount of political activity, as part of The Great Game.|$|E

5000|$|Major {{concerns}} are raised over hypnotherapy entering the CNHC. Notable {{among them is}} that hypnotherapy is a talking therapy such as counselling rather than a complementary therapy like reflexology. The CHNC also has been widely criticised for registering therapies and therapists {{without reference to the}} evidence base for their practice. In addition, the CNHC complaints procedure would allow for <b>hypnotherapists</b> to be complained about by other <b>hypnotherapists,</b> irrespective of whether the complaint relates to actual therapy with a client, and that this complaint could then be made public. Finally, many <b>hypnotherapists</b> question the validity of [...] "VSR" [...] arguing that if it's voluntary, it offers no public protection.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the strong}} {{association}} between awake bruxism and psychosocial factors (the relationship between sleep bruxism and psychosocial factors being unclear), {{the role of}} psychosocial interventions could be argued to be central to the management. The most simple form of treatment is therefore reassurance that the condition does not represent a serious disease, which may act to alleviate contributing stress. Other interventions include relaxation techniques, stress management, behavioural modification, habit reversal and hypnosis (self hypnosis or with a <b>hypnotherapist).</b> Cognitive behavioral therapy has been recommended by some for treatment of bruxism. In many cases awake bruxism can be reduced by using reminder techniques. Combined with a protocol sheet this can also help to evaluate in which situations bruxism is most prevalent.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and <b>hypnotherapist</b> Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

5000|$|Claims to be [...] "the largest" [...] {{professional}} hypnotherapy {{body can}} lead to perceived market leadership, increased status with <b>hypnotherapists</b> and even influence the future direction of hypnotherapy regulation.For example, the GHR {{claims to be the}} largest hypnotherapy organisation with 3,000+ registered <b>hypnotherapists</b> - however does that mean paying members or merely practitioners on its database?

2500|$|George Wilfred Proudfoot (19 December 1921 [...] 19 July 2013) was a British Conservative Party {{politician}} and former Member of Parliament (MP). He {{was also a}} prominent North Yorkshire businessman, well known for his ownership of the Proudfoot supermarket chain and Radio 270. In later life he embarked on a new career as a hypnotist and <b>hypnotherapist.</b> He died in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Erickson {{maintained}} {{that it was}} not possible consciously to instruct the unconscious mind, and that authoritarian suggestions were likely to be met with resistance. The unconscious mind responds to openings, opportunities, metaphors, symbols, and contradictions. Effective hypnotic suggestion, then, should be [...] "artfully vague", leaving space for the subject to fill in the gaps with their own unconscious understandings - even if they do not consciously grasp what is happening. The skilled <b>hypnotherapist</b> constructs these gaps of meaning in a way most suited to the individual subject - in a way which is most likely to produce the desired change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} {{received an}} important boost {{starting in the}} early 1950s through the work of anthropologist Gregory Bateson and colleagues – Jay Haley, Donald D. Jackson, John Weakland, William Fry, and later, Virginia Satir, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, Paul Watzlawick and others – at Palo Alto in the United States, who introduced ideas from cybernetics and general systems theory into social psychology and psychotherapy, focusing in particular {{on the role of}} communication (see Bateson Project). This approach eschewed the traditional focus on individual psychology and historical factors – that involve so-called linear causation and content – and emphasized instead feedback and homeostatic [...] mechanisms and “rules” in here-and-now interactions – so-called circular causation and process – that were thought to maintain or exacerbate problems, whatever the original cause(s). (See also systems psychology and systemic therapy.) [...] This group was also influenced significantly by the work of US psychiatrist, <b>hypnotherapist,</b> and brief therapist, Milton H. Erickson - especially his innovative use of strategies for change, such as paradoxical directives (see also Reverse psychology). The members of the Bateson Project (like the founders of a number of other schools of family therapy, including Carl Whitaker, Murray Bowen, and Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy) had a particular interest in the possible [...] causes and treatment of schizophrenia, especially in terms of the putative [...] "meaning" [...] and [...] "function" [...] of signs and symptoms within the family system. The research of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts Lyman Wynne and Theodore Lidz on communication deviance and roles (e.g., pseudo-mutuality, pseudo-hostility, schism and skew) in families of people with schizophrenia also became influential with systems-communications-oriented theorists and therapists. A related theme, applying to dysfunction and psychopathology more generally, was that of the [...] "identified patient" [...] or [...] "presenting problem" [...] as a manifestation of or surrogate for the family's, or even society's, problems. (See also double bind; family nexus.) ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{objective}} the BSCH {{is to establish}} standards of training and ethical practice {{regarding the use of}} hypnosis and hypnotherapy; within the United Kingdom there are (2010) currently no statutory regulations regarding hypnosis. The society was created in the early 1980s and was originally called the Association of Clinical <b>Hypnotherapists.</b> This name was subsequently changed to the British Society of Clinical <b>Hypnotherapists,</b> until finally becoming the British Society of Clinical Hypnosis in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The {{regulation}} of the hypnotherapy profession in the UK is at present {{the main focus of}} UKCHO, a non-profit umbrella body for hypnotherapy organisations. Founded in 1998 to provide a non-political arena to discuss and implement changes to the profession of hypnotherapy, UKCHO currently represents 9 of the UK's professional hypnotherapy organisations and has developed standards of training for <b>hypnotherapists,</b> along with codes of conduct and practice that all UKCHO registered <b>hypnotherapists</b> are governed by. As a step towards the {{regulation of}} the profession, UKCHO's website now includes a National Public Register of <b>Hypnotherapists</b> who have been registered by UKCHO's Member Organisations and are therefore subject to UKCHO's professional standards. Further steps to full {{regulation of the}} hypnotherapy profession will be taken in consultation with the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health.|$|R

40|$|An {{online survey}} was {{conducted}} to examine psychological therapists’ experiences of, and beliefs about, cases of recovered memory, satanic / ritualistic abuse, Multiple Personality Disorder / Dissociative Identity Disorder, and false memory. Chartered Clinical Psychologists (n= 183) and <b>Hypnotherapists</b> (n= 119) responded. In terms of their experiences, Chartered Clinical Psychologists reported seeing more cases of satanic / ritualistic abuse compared to <b>Hypnotherapists</b> who, in turn, reported encountering more cases of childhood sexual abuse recovered {{for the first time}} in therapy, and more cases of suspected false memory. Chartered Clinical Psychologists were more likely to rate the essential accuracy of reports of satanic / ritualistic abuse as higher than <b>Hypnotherapists.</b> Belief in the accuracy of satanic / ritualistic abuse and Multiple Personality Disorder / Dissociative Identity Disorder reports correlated negatively with the belief that false memories were possible...|$|R
