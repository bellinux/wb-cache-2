25|$|The pose of {{the woman}} (hand on heart and <b>eyes</b> <b>raised)</b> is similar to Ripa's image of Theology. The pose was {{uncommon}} in Dutch art, but Vermeer was considered an expert in Italian painting, in which the image was often used (especially those of Guido Reni , whose works were then owned in Holland). Wheelock believes the large book, which has a metal clasp, is a Bible, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art states on its website that the volume may be the Catholic Missale Romanum.|$|E
500|$|Momolo Mortara {{followed}} the Italian Army into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he {{was preceded by}} his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his <b>eyes,</b> <b>raised</b> his {{hand in front of}} him and shouted: [...] "Get back, Satan!" [...] When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: [...] "Before you get any closer to me, take off that assassin's uniform." [...] Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: [...] "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [...] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." [...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vision of}} Mary was {{described}} as being beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white cloak, hanging in full folds and fastened at the neck. The crown appeared of a golden brightness, of a deeper hue, than the striking whiteness of the robe she wore; the upper parts of the crown {{appeared to be a}} series of sparkles, or glittering crosses. She {{was described as}} [...] "deep in prayer", with her <b>eyes</b> <b>raised</b> to heaven, her hands raised to the shoulders or a little higher, the palms inclined slightly to the shoulders. Bridget Trench [...] "went in immediately to kiss, as I thought, the feet of the Blessed Virgin; but I felt nothing in the embrace but the wall, and I wondered why I could not feel with my hands the figures which I had so plainly and so distinctly seen".|$|E

40|$|Abstraction {{provides}} me {{with great}} freedom. Mixing abstraction and imagery introduces emotions and feelings. Color plays a vitally {{important role in}} my paintings.

60|$|Spite of {{the rich}} deep colour that nature had {{bestowed}} on the Indian beauty, the tell-tale blood deepened on her cheeks, until the blush gave new animation and intelligence to her jet-black <b>eyes.</b> <b>Raising</b> a finger in an attitude of warning, she dropped her voice, already so soft and sweet, nearly to a whisper, as she continued the discourse.|$|R
