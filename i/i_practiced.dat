I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of melancholy, I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.|$|E

Can practice research aim only at producing analysis and findings or does it have to produce changes in social work – and to whom? Practice research is and can be looked upon from different angles, from different positions and with different interests. To understand, qualify and develop practice research it is necessary to conceptualize and define – to build up a common understanding of practice research or at least to obtain a better understanding of what the differences are and what they contain. As an introductionary note, it has to be emphasized that there is an essential difference between the researcher and a person who works in a profession: the researcher views research as a goal in itself while the practitioner views research as means.

Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. <b>I</b> <b>practiced</b> around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.
