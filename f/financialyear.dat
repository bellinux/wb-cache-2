50|$|LPKF Laser & Electronics AG is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} mechanical engineeringcompany. It designs and manufactures laser systems. A typical application forthese systems is {{in the production of}} electronic components. Since thesecomponents need to be built into smaller and more compact devices - such assmartphones - the utilization of high-precision laser beams as tools isbecoming increasingly relevant.LPKF has pioneered the use of lasers in micro material processing. Since itsformation in 1976, the Company has created entirely new markets with itsinnovative ideas. Today, technology from LPKF is deployed in a wide range ofindustries - such as in the electronics sector, where LPKF systems are used todesign or separate circuit boards. The automotive industry uses LPKF lasers forparticulate-free welding of sensors or taillights. Solar cell manufacturers boost theefficiency of their modules by deploying LPKF laser scribers. Most recently, LPKFstarted offering a laser-based glass processing method for microelectronics.And a digital printing process for functional pastes has been added to theLPKF portfolio in 2016. In many areas, the superior precision offered by lasertechnology is replacing traditional techniques, thus paving the way for moreintelligent, digital production. LPKF has used its knowledge and experience in thefield of laser technology to acquire leadership in all of its markets. This is whythe Company invests around 10% of its revenue into research anddevelopment every single year.LPKF is headquartered in Garbsen near Hannover, Germany.
