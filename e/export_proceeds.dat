This gene is one of several genes located in the imprinted gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region have been associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer.

40|$|New Delhi {{will soon}} take a final {{call on the}} issue of setting up of a {{sovereign}} wealth fund (SWF). The idea of setting up an Indian SWF has been going around since 2007 when China established its major sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation (CIC), with an initial capital fund of $ 200 billion. However, this time the proposal has received strong support from India’s corporate leaders who recently suggested the establishment of a state-owned SWF primarily to secure access to natural resources and pursue strategic investment opportunities overseas. With the strong backing of corporate leaders, a SWF may soon be a reality and India will join other BRIC nations having such a fund. Although the initial capital of the proposed fund is still under discussion, it is unlikely to exceed $ 10 billion. Despite the excitement in official circles, the necessary preconditions for establishing a sovereign fund are missing in India. It appears that New Delhi is blindly following a “me-too ” approach rather than understanding the rationale behind setting up such funds. The main policy rationale behind setting up a SWF is not to secure access to natural resources or acquire strategic assets abroad, as perceived by New Delhi. Such funds are established to manage excessive foreign exchange reserves, commodity <b>exports,</b> the <b>proceeds</b> of privatisations and fiscal surpluses. Fo...|$|R

This can be attributed to two factors: (1) heavy dependence of <b>export</b> <b>proceeds</b> on a single export commodity (commodity concentration) and few export markets (geographical concentration); (2) disturbances in international prices and demand for some commodities. A realization of the government 2 ̆ 7 s continuing efforts to develop the production capacities and to improve the competitiveness of Saudi products in local and international markets reveals that diversifying the export base and targeting profit-potential markets could be conducted on the context of portfolio analysis. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate systematically how a well-diversified export portfolio of commodities/markets would minimize fluctuations in <b>export</b> <b>proceeds.</b> In order to apply the Markowitz-Tobin mean-variance portfolio selection model, the growth rates and the variance of export commodities/markets are treated as returns and risk in the conventional portfolio analysis. ^ An optimization problem to minimize instability in <b>export</b> <b>proceeds</b> subject to a given expected growth rate and some other constraints is solved. The problem set forth by the model is of a comparative static nature. It consists of deriving optimum export portfolios in which optimal shares of export commodities and markets are compared with actual shares. To achieve the goals of this study, low-, medium-, and high-risk strategies are demonstrated. Deciding what strategy is appropriate requires a comparison between the costs and the gains of diversification associated with each strategy. ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s findings reveal the dominance of some Arab countries in the composition of optimum export portfolios. That is, to reduce instability in <b>export</b> <b>proceeds,</b> exports to Syria, Lebanon and Yemen are recommended to be increased.

The sequences predict proteins with molecular masses of 13, 068, 26, 755, 9, 592, and 28, 933 Da, respectively. All four gene products were identified experimentally; consistent with their high hydrophobic residue content, they segregated with the membrane fraction. From N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, we conclude that fliO starts immediately after fliN rather than at a previously proposed site downstream. FliP existed in two forms, a 25 -kDa form and a 23 -kDa form. N-terminal amino acid analysis of the 23 -kDa form demonstrated that it had undergone cleavage of a signal peptide [...] a rare process for prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Site-directed mutation at the cleavage site resulted in impaired processing, which reduced, but did not eliminate, complementation of a fliP mutant in swarm plate assays. A cloned fragment encoding the mature form of the protein could also complement the fliP mutant but did so even more poorly. Finally, when the first transmembrane span of MotA (a cytoplasmic membrane protein that does not undergo signal peptide cleavage) was fused to the mature form of FliP, the fusion protein complemented very weakly. Higher levels of synthesis of the mutant proteins greatly improved function. We conclude that, for insertion of FliP into the membrane, cleavage is important kinetically but not absolutely required...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{therapeutic}} proteins {{are expressed}} in Escherichia coli and targeted to the periplasm {{in order to facilitate}} purification and enable disulfide bond formation. Export is normally achieved by the Sec pathway, which transports proteins through the plasma membrane in a reduced, unfolded state. The Tat pathway is a promising alternative means of export, because it preferentially exports correctly folded proteins; however, the reducing cytoplasm of standard strains has been predicted to preclude export by Tat of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in the native state because, in the reduced state, they are sensed as misfolded and rejected. Here, we have tested a series of disulfide-bond containing biopharmaceuticals for export by the Tat pathway in CyDisCo strains that do enable disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. We show that interferon α 2 b, human growth hormone (hGH) and two antibody fragments are exported with high efficiency; surprisingly, however, they are efficiently exported {{even in the absence of}} cytoplasmic disulfide formation. The exported proteins acquire disulfide bonds in the periplasm, indicating that the normal disulfide oxidation machinery is able to act on the proteins. Tat-dependent <b>export</b> of hGH <b>proceeds</b> even when the disulfide bonds are removed by substitution of the Cys residues involved, suggesting that these substrates adopt tertiary structures that are accepted as fully-folded by the Tat machinery. ...|$|R

Among the conclusions we highlight that there are several commonalities between the present and previous export booms, in the sense that: a) it reinforced the country?s diversified trade relations, with additional exports concentrated in non-traditional markets such as China, Russia, Africa, and South and Central American, non-Mercosur member countries; b) it did not change the relative share of manufactures in Brazil?s export basket, despite the excellent performance of agro-based exports since the early 1990 s; and c) both agricultural and manufacture exports have experienced an increasing product diversification.
