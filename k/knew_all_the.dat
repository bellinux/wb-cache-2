The effect was a dynamic style of architecture in which the forms seem to take on life of their own, moving, swaying and undulating. The name Baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged to {{continue}} her career, McVie recorded a solo album, Christine Perfect; following her success {{as a member of}} Fleetwood Mac, the album was reissued under the name The Legendary Christine Perfect Album. After marrying Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie, she joined Fleetwood Mac in 1970. She had already contributed backup vocals and painted the cover for Kiln House. The band had just lost founding member Peter Green, and its members were nervous about touring without him. McVie had been a huge fan of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac; and since she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> lyrics to their songs, she went along.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Arab-Israeli {{friction}} {{that led up to}} the Israeli war of Independence, the Porat Yosef Yeshivah was virtually turned into a fortress against frequent flashes of violence. When the Jewish quarter of the Old City fell to the invading Jordanian Army, the Jordanians set fire to the yeshivah and all surrounding houses, destroying all the books and manuscripts that Rabbi Kaduri could not smuggle to Beit El Yeshiva (Yeshivat HaMekubalim) in Jerusalem. He <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> writings of Rabbi Yitzhak Luria, the founder of modern Kabbalah by heart. After the passing of the leading kabbalist, Rabbi Efraim Hakohen, in 1989, the remaining kabbalists appointed Rabbi Kaduri as their head.|$|E

25|$|The {{expeditions to}} inland Brazil {{are divided into}} two types: the entradas and the bandeiras. The entradas were done {{in the name of}} the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main {{objective}} was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and chart unknown territory. The bandeiras, on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the São Paulo region (the Paulistas). The expeditions of the bandeirantes, as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The Paulistas, who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> old indigenous pathways (the peabirus) through the Brazilian inland and were acclimated to the harsh conditions of these journeys.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the money}} she gave up, her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, which was equal to 20 dollars a month. And her {{research}} and work place was very poor. However, she never gave up. After coming back to China, she began working as soon as possible. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS—finished making the first mono-crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of the working experience in Sylvania Company, she <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> processes in making the mono-crystalline silicon. However she could not get any equipment because of embargoes from other countries. So she changed the process and made the first mono-crystalline silicon in China in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon by itself. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace had been merchandized to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lanying Lin’s gallium arsenide reached the highest mobility {{at that time in}} the whole world.|$|E

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I am surprised how the margrave <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I feel all proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were the parent of a Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no way they could have known how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E

Hermione Hoby of The Guardian awarded the concert 5 stars, stating [...] "She sounds, moves and looks like a goddess {{and most of us}} 'bow down' accordingly". Kelli Kennedy writing for the Associated Press noted that Beyoncé [...] "slays at tour opening" [...] and further commented [...] "her commanding performance of [...] "Freedom" [...] served as reminder to the world that she 'breaks chains all by myself.

Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E
500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages." [...] That man is Frank B. Adams, known the world over as [...] "Yank" [...] Adams, at one time and even now the world's only finger billiardist who can make all the apparently impossible shots on the table without the aid of a cue. Adams is 76 years old, and after fifty years of exhibitions all over the [...] world has retired from active work to live in the Bronx and conduct a billiard academy of his own at Burnside and Creston avenues in New York with his business manager for the last ten years, Samuel Polakoff. Yank now lives at 635 West 136th street In New York. When I told Tom Foley, the daddy of all the roommkeepers, that Yank Adams was back in the business he laughed and said: [...] "I thought Yank had cashed in. But he's like all those billiard players. They never die." ...|$|E
