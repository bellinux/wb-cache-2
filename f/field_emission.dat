Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth.

40|$|It is {{important}} to minimize the <b>emissions</b> of electromagnetic <b>fields</b> {{to assure that the}} electrical equipment work properly. This thesis examines how to minimize electromagnetic fields with different cable types and placing of the cables. The cables are intended to be used in a hybrid heavy duty vehicle, for 600 V DC. Three different cable types was examined, one unshielded type, one shielded type and one type with two conductors with a common shield. The <b>emissions</b> of electric <b>field</b> from the cables were measured separately from the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>emissions.</b> The results of the measurements show that the electric <b>field</b> <b>emissions</b> are minimized by a shielded cable. The unshielded cables have a difference of 8 dBμV to the shielded cables at 0. 15 MHz, and at 0. 60 MHz is the difference increased to 18 dBμV. The magnetic <b>field</b> <b>emissions</b> are not affected by the cable type it is only affected by the placing of the cables. At 10 A is the magnetic field 28 μT when the cables are placed with 5 cm between them. When the cables have no distance between them the magnetic field is cancelled. Both the electric field and the magnetic field are minimized by a placing of the cables with no distance between them. If the cables are placed next to a grounded girder the electric <b>field</b> <b>emissions</b> is lowered with about 5 dBμV. If the girder is made of a material which conducts magnetic flux the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>emissions</b> is increased. The girder prevents the electromagnetic field to spread in four directions; it limits the emissions to three dimensions...|$|R

The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the work function at the tip apex.

This is the modern (post-1970s) {{international}} system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity ε0.

25|$|Oppenheimer had {{predicted}} that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this i(V) dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced tunneling of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal conduction band, with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of TEM, the associated technique of {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) was re-investigated and did not become developed until the 1970s, with Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago developing the <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> gun and adding a high quality objective lens to create the modern STEM. Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular dark-field imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates. In 2008, Jannick Meyer et al. described the direct visualization of light atoms such as carbon and even hydrogen using TEM and a clean single-layer graphene substrate.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{can also}} be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast. When using a <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed {{due to differences in}} phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction. Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex phase retrieval techniques.|$|E

25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because <b>field</b> <b>emission</b> guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures, which suggests {{they will have}} an important role in nanotechnology engineering. The highest tensile strength of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube has been tested to be 63GPa. Carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century, possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it. Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (>1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricated macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{is the study of}} the <b>field</b> {{electron}} <b>emission</b> (FEE) of diamond and related films synthesized by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The diamond and related films with different morphologies and compositions were prepared in a microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor and a hot filament CVD reactor. Various analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to characterize the surface morphology and chemical composition. The influence of surface morphology on the <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> property of diamond films was studied. The emission current of well-oriented microcrystalline diamond films is relatively small compared to that of randomly oriented microcrystalline diamond films. Meanwhile, the nanocrystalline diamond film has demonstrated a larger emission current than microcrystalline diamond films. The nanocone structure significantly improves the electron emission current of diamond films due to its strong field enhancement effect. The sp 2 phase concentration also has significant influence on the <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> property of diamond films. For the diamond films synthesized by gas mixture of hydrogen and methane, their <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> properties were enhanced with the increase of methane concentration. The <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> enhancement was attributed to the increase of sp 2 phase concentration, which increases the electrical conductivity of diamond films. For the diamond films synthesized through graphite etching, the growth rate and nucleation density of diamond films increase significantly with decreasing hydrogen flow rate. The <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> properties of the diamond films were also enhanced with the decrease of hydrogen flow rate. The <b>field</b> electron <b>emission</b> enhancement can be also attributed to the increase of the sp 2 phase concentration. In addition, the deviation of the experimental Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) plot from a straight line was observed for graphitic nanocone films. The deviation can be mainly attributed to the nonuniform field enhancement factor of the graphitic nanocones. In low macroscopic electric field regions, electrons are emitted mainly from nanocone or nanocones with the largest field enhancement factor, which corresponds to the smallest slope magnitude. With the increase of electric field, nanocones with small field enhancement factors also contribute to the emission current, which results in a reduced average field enhancement factor and therefore a large slope magnitude...|$|R

A nonoptimized antenna design for high power transponders {{may lead to a}} poor efficiency and high magnetic <b>field</b> <b>emissions.</b> Therefore, in this work, the energy transmission of inductive coupled systems is investigated, enabling an optimized system design. The RFID system is modeled by network elements in order to optimize the energy transmission. Next to a brief review of different methods for the antenna parameter determination, a new modification of the PEEC method is derived enabling an accelerated and accurate computation of the mutual coupling of the reader and the transponder antenna. Along with the simplification of the transformed transponder impedance and the investigation of the reader matching, consecutive design steps are deduced. The influence of the location-dependent antenna coupling on the energy transmission is characterized. Two case studies are carried out showing a successful transmission of 80 mW over a distance of up to 7. 6 cm by 275 mW reader output power.
