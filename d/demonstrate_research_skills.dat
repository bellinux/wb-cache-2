40|$|While faculty often express dismay {{at their}} students’ ability {{to locate and}} {{evaluate}} secondary sources, {{they may also be}} ambivalent about how to (and who should) teach the skills required to carry out quality undergraduate research. This project sought {{to assess the impact of}} programmatic changes and librarian course integration on students’ information literacy (IL) skills. Using an IL rubric to score student papers (n= 337) over three consecutive first-year student cohorts, our study shows that when faculty collaborate with librarians to foster IL competencies, the result is a statistically significant improvement in students’ <b>demonstrated</b> <b>research</b> <b>skills.</b> Our study also reveals a collaboration “sweet spot”: The greatest gains accrue when librarians provide moderate input into syllabus and assignment design, followed by one or two strategically placed hands-on library sessions. Successful collaboration thus need not entail completely overhauling content courses so as to make library instruction the centerpiece. Quite the opposite, librarians can help reduce the potential burden on faculty by supporting discipline- and course-specific research goals, as well as by sharing resources and best practices in IL pedagogy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Observations of {{high school}} student {{researchers}} indicated teenage frustration and apathy toward conducting quality research. The purpose of this action research was to evaluate an instructional tool designed to assist students in <b>demonstrating</b> exemplary <b>research</b> <b>skills.</b> Two hundred twenty students in ten classes participated in a lesson, which covered the use of research guide worksheets designed according to Eisenberg & Berkowitz’s Big Six skills. Instruction was followed by two hours of guided individual research. Student progress was measured through pre and post-tests, scoring of the worksheets, an attitudinal survey, and private interviews. With the use of guides students gathered more information through more sources. Although students did not like using the guides, they felt that the guides were helpful organizational tools and confidence builders. Guides will be revised {{based on the results}} of the study and will be incorporated into future research projects in all areas of the curriculum...|$|R
40|$|Master’s and {{doctoral}} students {{in particular are}} expected to <b>demonstrate</b> advanced <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> with regard to identifying, evaluating, recording and using information for <b>research,</b> especially their <b>skills</b> in analysing already published information which might be utilised to document the status quo of a particular aspect of a topic (sometimes called the literature study) [...] There are various ways and means to guide or coach advanced post-graduate students at masters {{and doctoral}} level. Once such approach is to work from within a virtually community of practice (VCoP). Because {{of the nature of}} learning content, additional benefits can be created. This paper will argue and demonstrate why a VCoP is the ideal environment to mentor doctoral students in certain aspects of their research (for example identifying a research problem, selecting investigative research questions, or writing a literature review). A theoretical framework as departure point will illustrate how knowledge transfer (or coaching) effectively takes place within a VCoP. The paper will then focus on information recording techniques as a case study. The latter {{is one of the most}} neglected areas in the information seeking process. The author will also demonstrate how mindmapping software can provide in an effective way to record or store information segments by means of multi-tier keywords.

40|$|This {{research}} project aimed generally {{to investigate the}} use of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to deliver legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> training at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). Legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> are an increasingly important part of students’ studies. It is vital that law graduates are equipped with the necessary <b>skills</b> to <b>research</b> a legal problem adequately to become a competent legal practitioner. As SOAS law students study not only English and EU law, but also the laws of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, they {{need to be able to}} develop <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> that enable them to find relevant regional material effectively, accurately and successfully. However, a number of problems have come to light at SOAS which have initiated a change in the way legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> training is currently delivered – including the issue of student retention, high numbers of international students, diversity of students’ backgrounds and skills, and their different information needs. Thus, an investigation was undertaken into how SOAS can use the capabilities of a VLE to help change the current approach to legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> training. A questionnaire was delivered to all law students currently studying at SOAS to discover their specific information needs relating to legal <b>research</b> <b>skills.</b> Additionally, an evaluation policy was constructed using previous research and the experience of other institutions, to evaluate two existing legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> programmes available in the UK and Australia. The results of this evaluation and questionnaire help to inform the construction of the framework. The results provided a general framework for the delivery of legal <b>research</b> <b>skills</b> training to undergraduate students at SOAS. By including the more generic skills as well as specific legal <b>research</b> <b>skills,</b> this framework has a wider application and can, therefore, be used, compared and adapted for further research by other institutions...|$|R
