50|$|Dempsey denied all changes, {{however, the}} Tribunal {{accepted}} {{the evidence of}} the clients over Dempsey’s, and in so doing found Dempsey guilty of four counts of professional misconduct and two counts of unsatisfactory professional conduct. The judgment was scathing of Dempsey. Discussing Dempsey’s claim that he had a meeting with the matrimonial client which was at odds with a letter he sent her and a diary note, Justice Atkinson remarked that:	Mr Dempsey’s letter of 2 October 2006 is entirely inconsistent with the meeting’s having taken place. He said he believed he dictated that letter on the afternoon of 28 September. Not only does it not refer to a meeting which on Mr Dempsey’s version had occurred only hours earlier on the day it was dictated, it concludes with the words, “If you have got any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or come in and see me. I have been trying to get you in to discuss this with you, but we have been missing each other.” Given the difficulty this placed him in, he then posited that perhaps he drafted the letter before he saw her and signed a letter which said they had not seen each other without really reading it. This was an adventitious explanation. This contemporaneous <b>document</b> <b>under</b> Mr Dempsey’s <b>hand</b> reveals the truth. There was no such meeting and Mr Dempsey’s protestations in evidence that he clearly remembers such a meeting were false. His evidence reveals why he said there was a meeting when there was not… He could not possibly justify taking the $30,000 unless he had told her about it and she had agreed to it.|$|R
