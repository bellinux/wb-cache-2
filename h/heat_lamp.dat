5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a <b>heat</b> <b>lamp.</b> Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E
50|$|Chicks {{require a}} warm {{environment}}. In a brooder, this warm environment is created artificially with a <b>heat</b> <b>lamp.</b> My Pet Chicken recommends a red <b>heat</b> <b>lamp,</b> because a white <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> {{can create a}} harsh and uncomfortable environment for the baby chicks. During {{the first week of}} the chicks' life, a temperature of 95 degrees is required. The temperature can be decreased by 5 degrees each week of the chicks life, until they reach week 6. At week 6, the birds should have enough feathers grown to be moved into their chicken coop. Checking on chicks often is important, as chicks that are too cold will huddle together to attempt to retain warmth, and chicks that are too hot will spread out in the brooder in attempts to cool down. Temperature can be adjusted accordingly by lowering and raising the <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> in the chick's brooder. Temperature can also be monitored by the use of a thermometer. Wooden chips are often used in the bottom of the brooder as a bedding.|$|E

50|$|Infrared <b>heating</b> uses {{infrared}} <b>lamps,</b> {{commonly called}} <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> to transmit infrared radiation {{to the body}} that is being heated. When bodies with a large surface area need to be <b>heated,</b> infrared <b>lamps</b> are often used in banks. Infrared <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> are commonly incandescent bulbs which are able to produce infrared radiation. Infrared lamps have many industrial applications including curing coatings and preparing plastic for forming, commercial applications such as cooking and browning food, and personal applications such as providing heat (especially in bathrooms and for pets).|$|R

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} needed for the lizard to {{properly}} synthesize vitamin D. In the wild, UVB rays are naturally provided by the sun, and in a captive environment, is needed to prevent the lizard from developing any calcium deficiency (Metabolic Bone Disease). Also, dust the lizard's prey with a calcium supplement specifically for reptiles {{as indicated by the}} manufacturer. Purchase an appropriate <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> and UVB bulb for your reptile. Keep a thermometer in the terrarium to monitor the temperature. The mid to upper 70s (23 - 26 Celsius) is fine and in the upper section of the enclosure, near the <b>heat</b> <b>lamp,</b> the temperature can range from the lower to mid 80s (27 - 30 Celsius).|$|E

50|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> is an {{incandescent}} light bulb that {{is used for the}} principal purpose of creating heat. The spectrum of black body radiation emitted by the lamp is shifted to produce more infrared light. Many heat lamps include a red filter to minimize the amount of visible light emitted. Heat lamps often include an internal reflector.|$|E

40|$|Electric <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> {{provide a}} versatile, {{inexpensive}} heat source for today's livestock production farming practices. Heat rays from infrared lamps {{pass through the}} air without heating it, as does energy from the sun. When these rays strike an animal, heat energy is absorbed. Using this radiant <b>heat</b> principle, <b>lamps</b> mounted at the proper height establish "comfort" zones where young animals can move about and seek the degree of warmth desired...|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} is {{a useful}} tool in visualizing and quantifying spatial distribution in radiant heat of incandescent <b>heat</b> <b>lamps.</b> Radial temperature profiles of six commercially available <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> (100 W to 250 W) were comparatively characterized. <b>Heat</b> <b>lamps</b> with the same power output do not necessarily produce the same temperature profiles on the heated surface because {{the shape of the}} temperature profiles was shown to be greatly affected by the lamp lens prescription. At a lamp height of 45. 7 cm (18 in.), the net usable area (NUA) for the piglets was 0. 102, 0. 155, 0. 146, 0. 275, 0. 139 and 0. 113 m 2 (1. 10, 1. 67, 1. 57, 2. 96, 1. 50, and 1. 22 ft 2), respectively, for 100 W Retrolite (100 CZ 20), 125 W Hogslat (125 HOG), 125 W SLI Lighting (125 SLI), 175 W Retrolite (175 CZ 20), 175 W Phillips (175 PLP), and 250 W SLI Lighting (250 SLI). The 175 CZ 20 had the largest NUA and was the most efficient lamp on the basis of NUA per rated Watt. Although the 250 SLI had the largest <b>lamp</b> <b>heated</b> area, it and the 175 PLP were the least efficient lamps due to the large hotspots they produced. Lamp height affects the size of heated area, hotspot area and NUA for most of the lamps tested. These results suggest that in a commercial swine farrowing system, the 175 CZ 20 has the most potential among the incandescent <b>heat</b> <b>lamps</b> tested for meeting the thermal needs of the piglets and improving energy efficiency of the localized supplemental heating...|$|R
5000|$|An {{infrared}} heater or <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> {{is a body}} with a higher temperature which transfers energy to a body with a lower temperature through electromagnetic radiation. Depending on {{the temperature of the}} emitting body, the wavelength of the peak of the infrared radiation ranges from [...] to 1 mm. No contact or medium between the two bodies is needed for the energy transfer. Infrared heaters can be operated in vacuum or atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{passes through}} rollers in the fuser assembly, where {{temperatures}} up to 200 C and pressure {{are used to}} permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) {{and the other is}} a rubber backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.|$|E
50|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of a soil sample may indicate {{the conditions under which}} the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, gravel and sands, sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, clays). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> is useful in separating particles.|$|E

50|$|This species {{generally}} {{requires a}} temperature gradient between 21-29 degrees Celsius (21-24 degrees during nighttime, and 26-29 degrees during the daytime), {{which can be}} provided through a <b>heat</b> <b>lamp</b> and an under-tank heater. Fresh water should be provided daily and faecal matter should be promptly removed to avoid bacterial infections. Heating rocks are not recommended, as in captivity, a snake will neglect to move from extremely hot surfaces, thus leading to either minor or severe burns. There exists no data whether this type of behaviour occurs in the wild or is restricted to captive settings. Any heated surface must always be tested before the reptile is exposed to it. The purchase of a thermometer and hygrometer are highly encouraged.|$|E
50|$|Baby yellow-bellied sliders may {{be kept in}} {{a fairly}} small tank (20 to 40 gallons), but as they age, after about three years,they will require much more space. One Adult may be housed in a 75 gal (or larger) aquarium. The turtles require enough water to turn around, with a depth of 16 - 18 in recommended. Water {{temperature}} should be kept between 72-80 °F (22-27 °C) and properly filtered. Keeping fish with turtles is usually avoided due to {{the risk that the}} turtle will eat the fish. Sliders need a basking area that is kept warm during the day and that will allow the turtle to move around, balance, and dry off completely. This area should average 89-95 °F (32-35 °C) and can be heated with a UV-A <b>heat</b> <b>lamp.</b> A second lamp that produces UV-B is absolutely essential for the turtle to metabolize calcium properly. Direct, unfiltered sunlight is preferable. The lamps should be switched on during daylight hours. Turtle tanks can be purchased at many pet goods retailers.|$|E
