Questions naturally arise concerning the efficacy of such testing with respect to both the manner of coupling of the fields to the helicopter systems {{as well as the}} levels required to achieve reasonable confidence in the coupling effects. This paper presents a comparison of the electric fields interior to an axially slotted circular cylinder and the fields in the slot aperture {{as a function of the}} distance from the source to the test item. Also, these measured interior and aperture fields are compared to two different mathematical / numerical models of the conducting cylinder with an axial slot running the length of the cylinder. Additional measurements are presented for the fields interior to a finite cylinder with conducting endcaps and a significantly reduced slot of finite length. Comparisons to one of the mathematical/numerical models for this finite length cylinder with finite length slot are presented also...|$|E
40|$|The intense {{electromagnetic}} environments (EMEs), such as {{the intentional}} electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic pulse, pose severe threats to the normal functions of electric and electronic systems. A system is usually composed of numbers of interdependently linked subsystems or equipments. The interactions {{of the system and}} the high-power EME involve large quantities of parameters and scenarios, so the complete tests or computations are usually difficult to fulfill, which leads to a hard mission to assess the system-level <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vulnerability.</b> This paper provides the thought of divide-and-rule to cope with this problem. First, it divides the system into relatively independent and manageable subsystems, and after respective tests and computations, the subsets of data are fused to characterize the whole system. The key point for this assessment methodology is to set up one model or framework to unify all the activities, which is completed here by the causal Bayesian networks (BNs). The system-level effects and the environment threats are characterized with the probability theory. The modeling and parameter determining techniques are presented. Since fault tree analysis (FTA) is also utilized in the electromagnetic risk assessment, the assessment procedures based on relatively BN and FTA are compared. The final results indicate that BN is capable of extending the modeling and analysis power of FT...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers {{increase}} {{the use of}} electrical and electronic components {{in all kinds of}} products to provide new functions, improve performance and reduce the operational and development costs. The counterpart is the introduction of new constraints such as the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vulnerability</b> where the equipment functioning can be disturbed by electromagnetic effect. The perturbation can happen in various conditions: (1) Inside an electrical harness between power supply wire and command wire; (2) Between electrical harnesses; (3) Or because of external sources (electrical equipment, engines, Wi-Fi etc.) or natural ones like lightening. This concerns machine design, robotic assembly lines, devices for commercial buildings and public facilities, embedded systems (aircraft, trains, boats, tramways, drones), and in general, all automatic devices and electrical systems. To reduce the time to market, manufacturers need tools able to: (1) Detect bad electromagnetic effects as soon as possible: before prototyping, during the design phase; (2) Avoid cable shielding when it is not necessary: lighter equipment, less manufacture operations (welding). An electromagnetic simulator, integrated into an electrical CAD software suite, used during the design phase, on a simple PC connected to HPC, would allow the manufacturers to adapt the design to electromagnetic constraints before building the first prototype. As of today, they generally identify the problems during testing phase, if not on the customer site during the installation with all consequences behind that...|$|E

The electromagnetic spectrum portion of the information environment {{is referred to as}} the electromagnetic environment (EME). The recognized need for military forces to have unimpeded access to and use of the <b>electromagnetic</b> environment creates <b>vulnerabilities</b> and opportunities for electronic warfare (EW) in support of military operations.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{efficient}} and secure implementations of lightweight symmetric cryptographic primitives for resource-constrained devices such as wireless sensors and actuators that are typically deployed in remote locations. In this setting, cryptographic algorithms must consume few computational resources and withstand a large variety of attacks, including side-channel attacks. The {{first part of this}} thesis is concerned with efficient software implementations of lightweight symmetric algorithms on 8, 16, and 32 -bit microcontrollers. A first contribution of this part is the development of FELICS, an open-source benchmarking framework that facilitates the extraction of comparative performance figures from implementations of lightweight ciphers. Using FELICS, we conducted a fair evaluation of the implementation properties of 19 lightweight block ciphers in the context of two different usage scenarios, which are representatives for common security services in the Internet of Things (IoT). This study gives new insights into the link between the structure of a cryptographic algorithm and the performance it can achieve on embedded microcontrollers. Then, we present the SPARX family of lightweight ciphers and describe the impact of software efficiency in the process of shaping three instances of the family. Finally, we evaluate the cost of the main building blocks of symmetric algorithms to determine which are the most efficient ones. The contributions of this part are particularly valuable for designers of lightweight ciphers, software and security engineers, as well as standardization organizations. In the second part of this work, we focus on side-channel attacks that exploit the power consumption or the electromagnetic emanations of embedded devices executing unprotected implementations of lightweight algorithms. First, we evaluate different selection functions in the context of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to infer which operations are easy to attack. Second, we show that most implementations of the AES present in popular open-source cryptographic libraries are vulnerable to side-channel attacks such as CPA, even in a network protocol scenario where the attacker has limited control of the input. Moreover, we describe an optimal algorithm for recovery of the master key using CPA attacks. Third, we perform the first <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vulnerability</b> analysis of Thread, a networking stack designed to facilitate secure communication between IoT devices. The third part of this thesis lies in the area of side-channel countermeasures against power and electromagnetic analysis attacks. We study efficient and secure expressions that compute simple bitwise functions on Boolean shares. To this end, we describe an algorithm for efficient search of expressions that have an optimal cost in number of elementary operations. Then, we introduce optimal expressions for first-order Boolean masking of bitwise AND and OR operations. Finally, we analyze the performance of three lightweight block ciphers protected using the optimal expressions...|$|E
