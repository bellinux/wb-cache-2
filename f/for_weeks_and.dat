5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E
5|$|When Suharto {{entered his}} seventh term as president, {{following}} an uncontested election on 10 March 1998, Indonesian students {{began a series}} of major demonstrations in protest of the New Order regime which continued <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> culminated in the shootings of four students by security forces at Trisakti University in May. The incident sparked major violence in several cities during 12–15 May. Property and businesses owned by Chinese Indonesians were targeted by mobs, and over 100 women were sexually assaulted; this aspect of the riots, though generally accepted as true, has been denied by several Indonesian groups. In the absence of security forces, large groups of men, women, and children looted and burned the numerous shopping malls in major cities. In Jakarta and Surakarta over 1,000 peopleboth Chinese and non-Chinesedied inside shopping malls. Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese fled the country following these events, and bankers estimated that US$20 billion of capital had left the country in 1997–1999 to overseas destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States.|$|E

25|$|FHM signs overlap {{significantly}} {{with those of}} migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time. These signs typically first manifest themselves in {{the first or second}} decade of life.|$|E

25|$|The Aleppo {{community}} {{guarded the}} Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together {{with three other}} Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the Central Synagogue of Aleppo, {{supposed to have been}} the Cave of Elijah. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, who asked that various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the responsa literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, Shalom Shachne Yellin sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten Bible. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ‘Ammudé Shesh by Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski, and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by Yosef Ofer in 1989.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} the story of the {{creation}} of the Onibaba involves the baby girl of a wealthy family in Kyoto. Although already five-years-old and otherwise healthy and happy, the child had not uttered a sound since birth. Worried and desperate, the family consulted doctor after doctor with no success until they came upon a fortune teller who told them that the cure was to feed the girl the fresh liver of a living fetus. This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman willing to give up her unborn child’s liver lasted <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman was wearing the omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E
25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> the fact that it does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
25|$|The young bishop Luka (Voino-Yasenetsky), {{a founder}} of the Tashkent {{university}} and its first professor of medicine, chief surgeon at the university and a brilliant sermonizer. He staid loyal to the Patriarch and he was first imprisoned in Tashkent in 1923, due to influence of the Renovationists who felt they could not compete with him. He was officially accused of treasonous ties to foreign agents in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and he was exiled to the distant northern-Siberian town of Eniseisk for three years. After he returned, he was arrested again in 1927 and exiled to Arkhangelsk without trial for another three years. He was loyal to Sergii. He was arrested again in 1937 and suffered his worst imprisonment in the subsequent years when he was tortured for two years (including beatings, interrogations that lasted <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>and</b> food deprivation) in fruitless NKVD attempts to have him sign confessions. When this failed, he was deported to northern Siberia. In 1941 after the war broke out, his unique expertise in treating infected wounds caused the state to bring him to Krasnoyarsk and make him chief sturgeon at the main military hospital. He was honoured at a ceremony in December 1945 with a medal for service he had given to war medicine. During the service he criticized the regime for locking him for so many years and preventing him from exercising his talents to save more. He became archbishop of Tambov after the war. He was given the Stalin Prize in 1946 for his new and enlarged addition of his book on infected wounds; he donated the prize money to war orphans. His case was also significant because of his survival.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E
