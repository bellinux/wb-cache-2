40|$|Development is the {{enlargement}} of people's choices. Optimal subsidy policy {{is intended to}} create the right incentives {{for each of the}} value chain participants. This paper contends that the <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy</b> offered by the Indian federal Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for solar thermal systems, through mainstream banking channels is superior in intent and outcome compared to the capital subsidy as currently offered for solar PV systems, routed through government controlled delivery channels. The <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy</b> enhances innovation, improves service delivery and expands the range of product available to consumers enjoying a wide range of endowments, thus leading to more inclusive development.

40|$|If the bidders in {{an auction}} have {{financial}} constraints, {{how should the}} seller design the auction to maximize his profit? An observed practice is that the seller offers a loan, or <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy,</b> to the highest bidder. The work by Che and Gale [3] has given a partial answer for second-price auctions, with default risk assumed. away. This paper provides a complete solution for first-price auctions, with default risk included. For each level of the <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy,</b> we solve the auction game and give a closed form solution for its symmetric equilibrium. From this we determine each bidder's behavior {{as a function of}} the interest charged by the seller. This behavior exhibits the following novel bifurcation: for low interest rates, poor firms bid high and rich firms bid low; for high interest rates, the reverse is true. At the "critical" rate, bids from poor and rich firms are identical. From the seller's point of view, we obtain a formula showing expected profit {{as a function of the}} <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy.</b> This allows computation of a best subsidy. We show that the best rate is always larger than the critical rate. These results are especially applicable to auctions of large projects, where bidders' financial constraints are significant.

The basic capitalization model is used as a starting point for the development of several models.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>interest</b> rate credit <b>subsidies</b> on {{economic}} development in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, occupational choice and financial frictions. There are two financial frictions: a cost to intermediate loans and a limited liability problem which maps into the degree of enforcement of credit contracts in the economy. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent’s type (ability and net wealth) and the credit market frictions. We then add a credit program in this economy that subsidizes the interest rate on loans. There is a fixed cost (which might be null) to apply for such loans {{in the form of}} bureaucracy and regulations. We show that for the United States, an <b>interest</b> rate credit <b>subsidy</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} output per capita, but it can have important negative effects on wages and government finances. For Brazil, a developing country in which financial repression is high and the government subsidies heavily loans, our counter-factual exercises show that if the country cuts all <b>interest</b> <b>subsidies,</b> there will no significant quantitative effect on output per capita, wages, inequality and government finances. However, when the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> is fixed at the level observed in Brazil, but access to the credit program is increased, then output and wages might both increase, as long as the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> does not not affect directly the spread on non-subsidized loans...|$|R

40|$|Our paper sets up {{a simple}} model to assess, {{to the best of}} our {{knowledge}} for the first time, the relative pros and cons of housing downpayment and <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> on the access to and the stability of the mortgage market. Our analysis unveils a number of relevant policy lessons for the design of housing subsidy programs, namely: (a) Under fiscal neutrality (same government outlay), both subsidies have the same positive effect on the ability and willingness to repay. But, for such neutrality to hold, the percentage <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> must be larger than the downpayment subsidy, which is rare to happen in practice; (b) The <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> raises the loan size a bank is willing to grant, but the downpayment subsidy does not, the reason being that the latter actually diminishes the need for bank financing for a given property value; (c) When targeting lower income households, the downpayment subsidy is superior to the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy,</b> as the former increases the loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, two key criteria for mortgage borrower eligibility. By the same token, the downpayment subsidy is more likely to have a stronger effect on low and medium value housing units; (d) Such progressivity comes at the cost of a higher probability of default, meaning that some trade-off between equity and financial stability may emerge; (e) Subsidies are likely to put upward pressure on housing prices. The downpayment subsidy has a direct effect (by injecting fiscal resources to cover part of the property price) and an indirect effect (by easing the access to the mortgage market); (f) The <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> only has the latter effect; and (g) Compared to the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy,</b> the downpayment support promotes a less aggressive competition in the real estate market...|$|R

It constitutes the first attempt to assess the incidence of tariffs imposed by the US on countries that span {{the entire range of}} per capita incomes. Average tariff rates are lower for the poorest and richest countries and higher for countries {{in the middle of the}} income distribution. This finding is not consistent with the widely held view that tariffs used by industrial nations bear more heavily on products of <b>export</b> <b>interest</b> to poorer developing countries than on imports from industrial nations. It is consistent with the tariff escalation pattern reported in earlier studies if advanced countries account for most products at the high end of the fabrication scale. Results show that poorest countries will find it difficult to escape tariffs by attaining higher levels of economic development.

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided in nine sections. A short {{introduction}} puts {{the subject matter}} in perspective {{in the context of}} the FTAA negotiations. Section 1 deals with obstacles to a successful conclusion of the FTAA both in Mercosur - especially in Brazil. The following section considers briefly how notions about reciprocity and balance of concessions have been applied in multilateral negotiations and how they may be adjusted in the case of negotiations involving free trade areas. The following two triads of sections refer to the United States (sections 3, 4 and 5) and Brazil (sections 6, 7 and 8). Sections 3 and 6 analyze in both economies how protectionist interests are distributed from the point of view of sectors affected and of their location (states and, for the United States, congressional districts). The relative importance of <b>export</b> <b>interests</b> by state is gauged in sections 4 and 7. The relative net balance of protectionist and <b>export</b> <b>interests</b> is evaluated in sections 5 and 8 under different assumptions in an effort to cope with the limitations of the measures used.

40|$|Government {{student loan}} schemes {{typically}} have implicit <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> which, while {{these are a}} cost to taxpayers, they {{have the benefit of}} diminishing repayment burdens for graduates. Our goal is to illustrate the extent of both <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> and repayment burdens with respect to Thailand's Student Loans Fund (SLF), using methods pioneered in measurement terms by (Ziderman, 1999) and (Ziderman, 2003). Our critical innovation is to calculate repayment burdens for graduates with widely differing earnings, and we find that these generally are relatively low because the SLF is heavily subsidized. Even so, for graduates with very low income the burdens can be high. Importantly we analyze and illustrate what the repayment streams would be if the SLF was redesigned to have no <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> and find that the burdens increase to extremely high levels for the lowest income graduates.
