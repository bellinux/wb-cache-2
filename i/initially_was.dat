Once in control of the camp, the Mongols slaughtered the Kievan army including Mstislav of Kiev and several other noble prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its strong}} {{relation}} with Indonesia, the Philippines <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> cold on the issue.

5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> indecisive {{about what}} to do with his life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of his status as a VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E

These began two days later and revealed so many problems with her engines and boilers that Chanzy was decommissioned for repairs on 6 December. Recommissioned on 1 May 1895 to test the repairs, she entered service on 20 July.|$|E
5|$|Conflicts between Ladislaus's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} developed into a civil war in 1264. Béla IV's troops, which were {{under the command of}} Ladislaus's aunt, Anna, captured the castle of Sárospatak, where Ladislaus and his mother were staying, and imprisoned them. Ladislaus <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> kept in the Turóc Castle, but two months later, he was sent to the court of Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow, who was Béla IV's son-in-law.

5|$|Created {{with the}} initial US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US25 {{replaced}} several previous state highway designations. Some of the preceding highways followed roadways created in the 19th and the early 20th centuries. It <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> only routed {{as far north as}} Port Huron; the northern extension to Port Austin happened in 1933. By the end of the 1950s, the entire route was paved. Starting in the early 1960s, segments of I-75 and I-94 were built, and US25 was shifted to follow them south of Detroit to Port Huron. A business loop was created when the main highway bypassed downtown Port Huron, and then in 1973, the entire designation was removed from the state. The final routing of the highway is still maintained by the state under eight different designations, some unsigned.|$|E

5|$|Damage in {{the state}} totaled to over $13billion (2004 USD). Charley <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> {{expected}} to hit further north in Tampa, and caught many Floridians off-guard due to a sudden change in the storm's track as it approached the state. Throughout the United States, Charley caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} with Germany in November 1918, {{the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though Baden <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction, Baden was ordered to replace it. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Baden arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 6th U.S. Infantry regiment, and <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> stationed in Indian Territory in the Red River Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself {{a place at the}} front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in Kentucky, he proved so adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post. By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in Puebla, Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General Winfield Scott.|$|E

According to Nintendo Power, Atlus did not reveal any details about the game's development, although {{it is known that}} it <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> planned to be titled Devil Busters. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei series, and the first entry to be released outside Japan.

5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E
5|$|The third design, by George Ivatt, <b>initially</b> <b>was</b> Type 'C1' {{and it was}} {{paired with}} the three {{locomotives}} Nos. 6253–6255. It was partially riveted and resembled a Type 'A' at its front end and a Type 'B' at the rear. The design was quickly followed by Type 'C2', which differed from the 'C1' in {{that it had a}} lower front edge and was fitted with Timken roller bearings. Only two 'C2's were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 6257.|$|E
