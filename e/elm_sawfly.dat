40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The zigzag <b>elm</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Aproceros leucopoda (Hymenoptera), {{originating}} from Asia is being {{considered as one}} of the major pests of elm trees (Ulmus spp.) within Europe where it was first recorded in 2003. Recent investigations document the fast spread of this invasive species in many European countries. In Slovakia, A. leucopoda was first recorded in 2009 but its occurrence here has not been reported since 2009. Herein, we summarize the data from the two consecutive years about the current distribution of A. leucopoda and its hosts in Slovakia, Central Europe, focusing on infestation of elm trees by this successful invader in different altitudes. Material and methods In 2014 and 2015 the investigations of A. leucopoda were conducted at 101 different plots across the country. At each plot, characteristic symptoms of leaf damage, occurrence of larvae, cocoons or adults were recorded along with the geographical coordinates and the altitude, and the host trees of A. leucopoda were identified at the species level. The distribution map of A. leucopoda was drawn using the field data. The infestation of elm trees along the altitudinal gradient was analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Dunn 2 Ì† 7 s test for multiple comparisons. Results and conclusions The zigzag <b>elm</b> <b>sawfly</b> A. leucopoda was observed at 31 plots (30. 7...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{invasive}} alien zigzag <b>elm</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Aproceros leucopoda (Hymenoptera: Argidae), {{native to}} East Asia, {{was identified as}} a new pest of elms (Ulmus spp.) in Europe in 2003. Following the first records in Poland and Hungary, it has been found in many other European countries. Plant taxa on which damage by larval feeding has been observed under natural conditions either in Asia or in Europe all belong to the genus Ulmus. Ulmus pumila (including var. arborea) seems to be a preferred host, but other species have also been reported as having suffered severe defoliation by the pest. One objective of our study was to complete information on the distribution of the sawfly species in Hungary. Moreover, we searched for Ulmus taxa which might be affected under natural conditions. Materials and methods: To provide data on distribution and susceptible elms, we carefully checked Ulmus taxa for the presence of any juvenile developmental stages of A. leucopoda and the characteristic feeding traces on leaves in 17 arboretums and botanical gardens throughout Hungary in 2011 and 2016. Results and conclusions: We have recorded A. leucopoda or only the clear symptoms of damage by it at all the locations visited and totally on 20 Ulmus taxa. We have identified 14 of these {{for the first time as}} being susceptible to the pest. We suggest that the suitability for egg laying and sensitivity to at least partial damage by A. leucopoda of the damaged taxa should be considered before planting them for any purposes...|$|E
