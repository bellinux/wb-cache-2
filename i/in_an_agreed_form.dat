40|$|During the {{development}} of complex assemblies such as aircraft the noise from installed components must be considered. For airborne sound sources this issue has been resolved to some extent by standard measurement procedures which allow equipment suppliers to transfer data to end users <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>form.</b> The same cannot be said for structure borne sound sources however because no widely accepted standard test methods currently exist. The main complicating factor is that the procedures used for airborne sound source characterisation are not suited to the evaluation of structure borne noise because both source strength and coupling to the assembly must be considered and, as a result, no easily interpretable characterisation quantity can be found that applies beyond some special circumstances. The in-situ measurement of blocked forces is a promising approach for reaching some consensus in this area but it does differ in many ways from the accepted norms of the standard procedure because it favours the use of narrowband data and the inclusion of phase. In this paper {{we look at the}} advantages and disadvantages of the blocked force approach together with the associated uncertainties and how they might be presented or quantified in a standardised method...|$|E
40|$|This review {{presents}} a concept, which assumes that thermal decomposition processes play <b>a</b> major role <b>in</b> defining {{the sensitivity of}} organic energetic materials to detonation initiation. As a science and engineering community we are still far away from having a comprehensive molecular detonation initiation theory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> widely <b>agreed</b> upon <b>form.</b> However, recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods allow for a constructive and rigorous approach to design and test the theory {{or at least some}} of its fundamental building blocks. In this review, we analyzed a set of select experimental and theoretical articles, which were augmented by our own first principles modeling and simulations, to reveal new trends in energetic materials and to refine known existing correlations between their structures, properties, and functions. Our consideration is intentionally limited to the processes of thermally stimulated chemical reactions at the earliest stage of decomposition of molecules and materials containing defects...|$|R

Epideictic rhetoric, concerned with the present, is an important and regular activity that occurs in interpersonal communication, thus heightening the potential for spiritual exchange. The term “spiritual” may mean a recognition of and connection to the Divine, God, or a Universal Energy that guides our actions and interactions with all things. It may also mean a connection forged purely in the linguistic sense, wherein our words and symbols bring us together and allow us to transcend difference through loving, empathic, and compassionate acts. Or, it may imply both, depending on the term’s meaning for any given person. In this dissertation, spirit and Spirit are used to embrace both understandings of the term. <b>As</b> conceived <b>in</b> this dissertation, rhetoric as celebration is an action and an experience—a conscious act involving form, identification and spirit—that happens interpersonally when we share our storied lives with one another. ^ To examine how rhetoric functions in this way, the decades-long written correspondence between Williams Carlos Williams and Kenneth Burke served as the case study for analyzing the rhetorical act of sharing stories between two persons. By participating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> other’s <b>form,</b> <b>agreeing</b> to be induced by and collaborating with the other’s story as it unfolds, we come to identify with each other <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> way that the spirit animating our humanity is revealed to us. Becoming consubstantial through rhetoric allows for the making of meaning where empathy is achieved. The Burke/Williams friendship captures this moment where they commune and become consubstantial, illustrating how rhetoric functions as celebration. The results of the analysis yielded a refinement and redefining of celebratory rhetoric in light of Burke’s theories of “form” and “identification” as they operate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> personal context and <b>in</b> concert with <b>a</b> recognition of and appreciation for the spirit that flows between persons and animates their communication. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of cancer or of any other disease, the physician or surgeon wishes to give the patient the most effective treatment. On some occasions cure is almost certain, e. g. following excision of a small rodent ulcer; on others treatment will be based upon a judgement designed to offer the greatest possibility of symptomatic relief and long term survival with minimal immediate and delayed toxicity. The mixture of perceived wisdom, medical prejudice and patient preference which forms the advice given and which leads to <b>an</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>form</b> of therapy arises in part from analysis of the medical literature, recognising that many questions remain unanswered.

40|$|Universal Grammar (UG) {{allows a}} {{multitude}} of devices that can be drawn on to express focus. The child's task is to reconcile the possible UG options with the positive data provided by the target language. In English, except for the cleft structure, focus is indicated by word stress. I argue that some children initially hypothesize that focus is signaled by syntactic movement. The empirical evidence {{in favor of this}} argument comes from a longitudinal diary data from one child, A. L., from age 1; 9 to 2; 4. In contexts in which the subject of the sentence receives either contrastive or emphatic focus, A. L. produces utterances like “You're do it,” or “I'm do it. ” The nominative pronoun and <b>an</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>form</b> of be are claimed to be moved to a position of focus in the phrase structure. Further, the first-person utterances like “I'm do it” are preceded by utterances with the form “My do it” in the same contexts. This leads to the proposal that my is a metathesized form of I'm, not a genitive pronoun as claimed <b>in</b> previous literature. <b>As</b> a consequence, subjects bearing genitive case are claimed not to exist in child English. 43 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Truths will {{be defined}} as an {{agreement}} on uncertainties, the consensus over matters of empirical and social nature such as mathematics, physics or economics. As illustrated by Dennis Lindley, ‘individuals tend to know things to be true and false but the extent of this truth and falsity would always remain unknown’. Leading individuals to a permanent state of stress, uncertainty becomes a risk for the social community. Problems could not be presumed to be solvable as any kind of solution would be perceived as uncertain. The struggle for solutions would develop {{into a state of}} insecurity and conflict where no individual could trust the answers given by any other member of the community. To prevent a ‘war of all against all’ that would cause anxiety and permanent conflict, it will become an essential duty for the social community to diminish uncertainty by imposing truths. With those, individuals can be reassured about the certainty of their knowledge and use truths as a resolution tool for any dispute that might occur within the social space. For the purpose of social peace, truths will therefore be every outcome of the process through which uncertainty is transformed into <b>an</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>form</b> of knowledge. “Gravity”, “Death” and “God” will all be considered truths as they represent a form of agreement over different domains of the human and social life. It is not the intention of this essay to examine each of the truths separately but rather, to analyse them all together in order to formulate a hypothesis for all empirical and social matters...|$|R
