Although noting that there were no clear figures available for the gender balance within the community, he cited practitioners who claim that there are more men active within Swedish Heathen organisations.

Camden's decline stemmed from the lack in jobs once these companies moved over seas.

These organizations are located in all Camden sub-sections and offer free services to all city residents in an attempt to combat poverty and aid low income families. The services offered range from preventative health care, homeless shelters, early childhood education, to home ownership and restoration services. Nonprofits in Camden strive to assist Camden residents in need of all ages, from children to the elderly. Each nonprofit organization in Camden <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> on the community with specific goals and services.

Camden's nonprofits also focus on development, prevention, and revitalization of the community.
