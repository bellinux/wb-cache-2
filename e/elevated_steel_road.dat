40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the seismic vulnerability of <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> storage tanks rested upon reinforced concrete columns through a probabilistic seismic assessment approach. In particular, an <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> storage tank which collapsed during the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake in Turkey is considered. In this respect, in order to evaluate the earthquake performance of the tank components during earthquakes, nonlinear time history analyses are conducted on a three-dimensional finite element stick model. Then, probabilistic seismic demand models incorporating uncertainty parameters for the tank components are established using two sets of ground motion records that represent the near-source and far-field characteristics of the earthquakes. Relevant fragility curves which present the most likely damage states of the tank components are derived using both cloud and incremental dynamic analysis methods. The efficiency and sufficiency of different ground motion intensity measures are also evaluated, leading {{to the conclusion that}} in analyzed case, the peak ground acceleration demonstrates the best performance among selected intensity measures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{multiple}} base motion {{effect on}} hydrodynamic pressure, acceleration of tank and fluid surface elevation problem in Elevated water tank {{is understood as}} a Fluid-Structure-Soil Interaction problem. Where, Soil-Structure interaction causes rocking motion and Fluid Structure interaction causes the hydrodynamic behaviour of water tank. According to the available literature, substantial amount of study {{has been done on}} behaviour of <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> water tank under pure rocking, but no study is done on water tanks with horizontal and vertical earthquake excitation, along with rocking motion. An experimental investigation for a 1 : 4 scale model of cylindrical <b>steel</b> <b>elevated</b> water tank has been carried out on shake table facility at CSIR-SERC, Chennai. Test program on <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> water tank consisted of combined horizontal, vertical and rocking motions, for a synthetic earthquake excitation for 0. 1 g and 0. 2 g accelerations, with increasing angle of rocking motion. The impulsive base shear and impulsive base moment values increase with increase in earthquake acceleration. Whereas, the convective base shear and base moment values increase for increase in earthquake acceleration, but decrease with increasing angular motion. Hence, there is no considerable effect of rocking motion on sloshing of water. The non-linearity in structure is observed, when the impulsive pressure of tank decreases with increase in tank acceleration. The pressure variation along tank height due to vertical excitation increased with increasing acceleration, and increased furthermore with added rocking. Using various codes available on water tanks, the recorded experimental results were used to calculate and compare the base shear, base moment, pressure variation in the tank...|$|R

40|$|Earthquake {{response}} of <b>elevated</b> liquid storage <b>steel</b> tanks isolated by the linear elastomeric bearings is investigated under real earthquake ground motion. Two types of isolated tank models are considered {{in which the}} bearings are placed at the base and top of the steel tower structure. The continuous liquid mass of the tank is modelled as lumped masses known as sloshing mass, impulsive mass and rigid mass. The corresponding stiffness constants associated with these lumped masses have been worked out depending upon {{the properties of the}} tank wall and liquid mass. The mass of steel tower structure is lumped equally at top and bottom. Since the damping matrix of the isolated tank system is non-classical in nature, the seismic response is obtained by the Newmark’s step-by-step method. The {{response of}} two types of tanks, namely slender and broad tanks, is obtained and a parametric study is carried out to study the effects of important system parameters on the effectiveness of seismic isolation. The various important parameters considered are the tank aspect ratio, the time period of tower structure, damping and the time period of isolation system. It has been shown that the earthquake response of the isolated tank is significantly reduced. Further, it is also observed that the isolation is more effective for the tank with stiff steel tower structure in comparison to flexible towers. In addition, a simplified analysis is also presented to evaluate the response of the <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> tanks using two-degrees-of-freedom model and two single-degree-of-freedom models. It is observed that the proposed analysis predicts the seismic response of <b>elevated</b> <b>steel</b> tanks accurately with significantly less computational efforts. © Elsevie...|$|R
