5|$|For {{a second}} DUI {{conviction}} in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs (e.g. weekends in jail).|$|E
500|$|Penalties for DUI vary by {{level of}} {{intoxication}} {{and number of}} previous convictions. A first offense DUI with a BAC level of less than 0.10% faces a fine of $250 to $400, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1000 per year for 3 years, 12 hours of alcohol education, a 3-month license suspension, and imprisonment for up to 30 days (rarely imposed). If the driver's BAC level is 0.10% or greater, the fine increases to $300 to $500, and the license suspension increase to 7 to 12 months. If the driver's BAC level is 0.15% or greater, the driver {{will be required to}} have an ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> installed in their car for 6 to 12 months after they have their license restored. [...] New Jersey does not have administrative license revocation, and thus a suspected drunk driver's license is not suspended until they are convicted.|$|E
50|$|An {{ignition}} <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> or breath alcohol ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> (IID and BAIID) is a breathalyzer for an individual's vehicle. It {{requires the}} driver to blow into a mouthpiece on the device before starting the vehicle. If the resultant breath-alcohol concentration analyzed result {{is greater than the}} programmed blood alcohol concentration (which varies between countries), the device prevents the engine from being started. The <b>interlock</b> <b>device</b> is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is directly connected to the engine’s ignition system.|$|E

40|$|OVERVIEW: A {{signaling}} system provides {{a form of}} control information that supports safe and stable railway transportation. Signaling systems include <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> (which control point machines and signals), ATP (automatic train protection) systems, etc. These systems require continual improvement to meet evolving needs of the future. Hitachi, Ltd. has developed various new {{signaling system}}s. The digital ATP system realizes high density operation for rolling stock and provides maximum riding comfort with continuous-curve brake control. Our proposed electronic <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> series has dual verification architecture, in which an <b>interlocking</b> <b>device</b> and electronic terminal are mounted on the same rack, to save on space and improve maintainability. The Shinkansen ATP and interlocking system is an integrated system which consists of <b>interlocking</b> <b>devices</b> and ATP logic devices. The system saves space {{in the area where}} the equipment is installed and reduces costs. The development of these new signaling systems will contribute to the improvement of railway services in the near future...|$|R
