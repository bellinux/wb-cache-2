5|$|A <b>flat-bottomed</b> design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and {{unloading}} of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Boeing {{selected}} the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were {{closer to the}} ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved {{from the bottom of}} the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive <b>flat-bottomed</b> shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.|$|E
5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic <b>flat-bottomed</b> puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the Livanjsko field, an elongated <b>flat-bottomed</b> valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct supply route between Drvar in the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, <b>flat-bottomed</b> valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E
5|$|The {{hull and}} single funnel {{amidships}} were both finished in black paint, {{with a single}} white stripe running {{the length of the}} hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was <b>flat-bottomed,</b> with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rain}} continued, Washington {{sent a letter}} instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge between Manhattan and {{what is now the}} Bronx, to send every <b>flat-bottomed</b> boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of {{infantry}} from New Jersey came to reinforce their position. At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn. The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.|$|E
5|$|Huskisson {{was loaded}} onto the <b>flat-bottomed</b> wagon of the Duke's train which had carried the band. The {{remaining}} three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by Northumbrian, {{set off for}} Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his head {{on his knees and}} tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record. The crowds lining the route, unaware of what had happened, cheered and waved as Northumbrian rushed past.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design <b>flat-bottomed,</b> unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|On Goodenough Island, between 8 and 14 March 1943, Australian patrols {{from the}} 47th Infantry Battalion found and killed 72 Japanese, {{captured}} 42 and found another nine dead on a raft. One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two <b>flat-bottomed</b> boats, in which were found some documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document {{turned out to}} be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units that had never before been reported. A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were <b>flat-bottomed</b> boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, Japanese troops and sailors were again shipwrecked on Goodenough Island. Responding to reports from ANGAU, the police and civilian informants, patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors. In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943, the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42, and found another nine dead on a raft. A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two <b>flat-bottomed</b> boats. In the boats they found documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document {{turned out to be a}} copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units never previously reported. Moreover, a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, <b>flat-bottomed</b> steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a <b>flat-bottomed</b> hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E
25|$|Pie pans are <b>flat-bottomed</b> flare-sided tins {{specifically}} designed for baking pies.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1304 {{the type of}} ship {{required}} by the Danish defence organization changed from galley to cog, a <b>flat-bottomed</b> sailing ship.|$|E
25|$|In 1927 {{he came to}} own the <b>flat-bottomed</b> scow schooner, City of Grand Haven, {{which was}} built by Duncan Robertson and was {{originally}} owned by Kirby, Furlong & Co.|$|E
25|$|Freestyle Playboat - the {{shortest}} possible, wide, planing-hull (<b>flat-bottomed)</b> boat for surfing and aerial tricks on standing waves and in hydraulic holes. Competitions are scored for difficulty of maneuver.|$|E
25|$|Spiders are skillets {{with three}} thin legs {{to keep them}} above an open fire. Ordinary <b>flat-bottomed</b> skillets are also {{sometimes}} called spiders, though the term has fallen out of general use.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} Danube Fleet of the Ottoman Navy at {{the time}} of the Great Turkish War in the late 17th century was 52 vessels (4 galliots, 28 frigates and 20 <b>flat-bottomed</b> river boats) manned by 4,070 crew.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, <b>flat-bottomed</b> cell design {{to allow it to}} sit on the ground and large (500mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer.|$|E
25|$|Drill bits with {{no point}} angle {{are used in}} {{situations}} where a blind, <b>flat-bottomed</b> hole is required. These bits {{are very sensitive to}} changes in lip angle, and even a slight change can result in an inappropriately fast cutting drill bit that will suffer premature wear.|$|E
25|$|In {{most of the}} world, <b>flat-bottomed</b> {{rail and}} {{baseplates}} became the standard. However, in Britain, bullhead rail-and-chairs remained in use {{until the middle of}} the twentieth century. They are now largely obsolete but can still be found on the London Underground, some sidings and at London Waterloo Platforms 1-4.|$|E
25|$|Access for {{mechanically}} powered boats {{is prohibited}} above 'La Mimosa' Pub (at the upstream end of Jesus Green) between 1 April and 30 September, when {{the middle and}} upper river are open only to manually propelled craft. The most common of these are the <b>flat-bottomed</b> punts.|$|E
25|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{watercraft}} were {{used on the}} Patowmack Canal and in the Potomac River. Gondolas were 60-by-10-foot log rafts usually sold at journey's end for their wood by their owners, who returned upstream on foot. Sharpers were <b>flat-bottomed</b> boats, 60 by 7 feet, usable only on high-water days, about 45 days per year.|$|E
25|$|The Post Office {{issued a}} 3-cent {{commemorative}} stamp, on December 10, 1951, at Brooklyn, New York, {{to commemorate the}} 175th anniversary of the Battle of Brooklyn. The stamp portrays the evacuation of General Washington's troops from Brooklyn {{at the site of}} the Fulton Ferry House, with an accurate depiction of the house and the <b>flat-bottomed</b> ferries used to cross the East River.|$|E
25|$|Elvington Halt. The {{overgrown}} platform face survives, of red stock bricks with edging in blue engineers'. Some sawn-off {{lengths of}} original EKLR bullhead rail {{are used as}} a vehicle barrier {{at the start of}} the access path in Elvington; the original rail used was <b>flat-bottomed</b> so these seem to belong to a re-laying of the line from Shepherdswell to the colliery from 1939.|$|E
25|$|A collier (cargo ship {{carrying}} coal) {{may hold}} 40,000 long tons of coal and takes {{several days to}} unload. Some colliers carry their own conveying equipment to unload their own bunkers; others depend on equipment at the plant. For transporting coal in calmer waters, such as rivers and lakes, <b>flat-bottomed</b> barges are often used. Barges are usually unpowered and must be moved by tugboats or towboats.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Indian texts {{called the}} Puranas {{describe}} {{the earth as}} a <b>flat-bottomed,</b> circular disk with concentric oceans and continents. This general scheme is present {{not only in the}} Hindu cosmologies but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. However, some Puranas include other models. For example, the fifth canto of the Bhagavata Purana, includes sections that describe the earth both as flat and spherical.|$|E
25|$|Bligh broke camp by 3 in {{the morning}} of the 11th and reached the beach at Saint Cast before 9 but the embarcation went very slowly. The {{transports}} stood well off shore and the <b>flat-bottomed</b> landing boats used to carry some 70 men each were initially employed loading supplies, artillery, livestock and horses. Hardly any soldiers had embarked when the French appeared and began a cannonade of the beach.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, <b>flat-bottomed</b> holes in wood, in any {{orientation}} {{with respect to the}} wood grain. Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E
25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a <b>flat-bottomed</b> hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E
25|$|The Bateaux-Lavoirs {{were large}} <b>flat-bottomed</b> barges, {{protected}} by wooden or straw roofs, which were moored at designated places along the Seine {{and used by}} laundresses to wash laundry in the river. The laundresses paid the owners a fee {{for the use of}} the boat. There were some eighty of them in 1714; groups of six, moored two by two, were anchored across from Notre Dame, near the Pont Saint-Michel, and near the rue de l'Hôtel-Colbert. They preferred to be on the right bank, so the sunshine could dry the laundry.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the rails}} used were <b>flat-bottomed,</b> 80lb per yard (90lb {{in areas where}} heavy wear was expected), spiked {{directly}} on to the sleepers of creosoted Baltic pine. Only the sharp curve at Shepherdswell had the rails bent to shape; elsewhere, short straight lengths were used on curves. Colonel Stephens obtained various job lots of rails from the salvage dump at Richborough Port, and these included 60lb rails which {{were used for the}} Wingham extension and the Richborough Port branch. The ballast used was colliery waste and ash. There was a universal speed restriction of 25mph.|$|E
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. For fastening <b>flat-bottomed</b> rails, an upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, <b>flat-bottomed</b> holes in wood, in any {{orientation}} {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E
