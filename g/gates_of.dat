These are, in counter-clockwise order: Fit Ber (also called Jan Tekle Ber) opening onto Adababay; Wember Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Judges); Tazkaro Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Funeral Commemoration), {{which had a}} bridge destroyed by fighting {{during the reign of}} Iyasu II; Azaj Tequre Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Azaj Tequre), which once was connected by a bridge to Adababay Tekle Haymanot church; Adenager Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Spinners), which was linked by a bridge to Qeddus Rafael church in the weaver's section of Gondar; Qwali Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's Attendants), next to the modern entrance to Elfin Giyorgis church inside the Enclosure; Imbilta Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Musicians); Elfign Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Privy Chamber), which gave access to the private apartments of the Fasil Ghebbi; Balderas Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Commander of the Cavalry); Ras Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Ras), also known as Qwarenyoch Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Qwara people); Ergeb Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Pigeons), also known as Kechin Ashawa Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Gifts); Inqoye Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Princess Inqoye, the mother of Empress Mentewab; and Gimjabet Mariyam Ber (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury of Mary), which leads to the churchyard of Gimjabet Mariyam church.|$|R

The <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Joigny or Porte de Joigny was rebuilt in the 16th century; the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sens, or Porte de Sens, predates it by {{three hundred years}} and is similar in appearance.|$|R
5|$|Van Millingen {{identifies}} this gate {{with the}} early Byzantine Gate of Melantias (Πόρτα Μελαντιάδος), but more recent scholars have proposed {{the identification of the}} latter with one of the <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> the city's original Constantinian Wall (see above).|$|E

5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.|$|E
500|$|There {{are seven}} {{historic}} gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Ashkelon), Bab al-Darum (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Sea), Bab Marnas (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Town), Bab al-Khalil (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Tell al-Muntar). Some {{of the older}} buildings use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market {{as well as the}} Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara ("the Samaritan's Bathhouse.") ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the Abbasids, Homs was known for its seven gates. They were Bab al-Souq (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Market), Bab Tadmur (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Palmyra), Bab al-Dreib (or Bab al-Deir), Bab al-Sebaa (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Lions), Bab al-Turkman (<b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Turkmen), Bab al-Masdoud (Closed Door), and Bab Hud (The <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Hud). Only two gates—Bab Tadmor and Bab al-Dreib—remain today. The oldest of Homs' mosques and churches are located in the Old City.|$|R
50|$|In 1517, the Ottoman Turks {{conquered the}} Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and Syria, {{during the reign}} of Selim I. As territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Hijaz, {{including}} Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca, passed into Ottoman possession. The Ottomans rebuilt the weak walls of Jeddah in 1525 following their victory over the Lopo Soares de Albergaria's Armada in the Red Sea. The new Turkish wall included six watchtowers and six city gates. They were constructed to defend against the Portuguese attack. <b>Of</b> the six <b>gates,</b> the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Mecca was the eastern gate and the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Magharibah, facing the port, was the western <b>gate.</b> The <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sharif faced south. The other gates were the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Bunt, <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Sham (also called <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Sharaf) and <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Medina, facing north. The Turks also built The Qishla of Jeddah, a small castle for the city soldiers. In the 19th century these seven gates were minimized into four giant gates with four towers. These giant gates were the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sham to the north, the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Mecca to the east, the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Sharif to the south, and the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Al-Magharibah on the sea side.|$|R
5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it is known that Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors, particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> some houses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a useful}} {{deterrent}} against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched through the <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> Shanhai Pass and replaced {{the most ardent}} of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.|$|E
5|$|Although {{busy with}} The <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.|$|E

5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador noted a {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper at the <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Dawn.

5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav, the victory at the <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Trajan {{extended}} the Bulgarian successes achieved since 976.

His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> the forts of Esztergom, Győr, Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) and Veszprém in order to threaten {{all of those who}} were conspiring against the young monarch.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the site}} <b>of</b> the main <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> the Viceroy's Office. During the period of Taiping Rebellion, it became the site <b>of</b> the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> True God's Glorious Light, the main <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> the Heavenly King's Palace, which was {{destroyed}} soon after the imperial troops captured the palace. In 1870, the gate was rebuilt as the main <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> the viceroy's office, and demolished when the NRA captured Nanjing in 1927.|$|R
50|$|No {{building}} {{within the}} palace survives today.

5|$|Phraates I is {{recorded}} as expanding Parthia's control past the <b>Gates</b> <b>of</b> Alexander and occupied Apamea Ragiana, {{the locations of}} which are unknown.

5|$|Renoart of Nephin pillaged the {{countryside}} and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle at the <b>gates</b> <b>of</b> the town.

500|$|The {{last known}} gate is the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Melantias ( [...] , Porta tēs Melantiados), whose {{location}} is also debated. Van Millingen considered {{it to be}} a <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> the Theodosian Wall (the Pege Gate), while more recently, Janin and Mango have refuted this, suggesting that it was located on the Constantinian Wall. Again however, while Mango identifies it with the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Prodromos, Janin considers the name to have been a corruption of the ta Meltiadou quarter, and places the gate {{to the west of the}} Mocius cistern. Other authors identified it with the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Adrianople (A. M. Schneider) or with the <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> Rhesios (A. J. Mordtmann).|$|R
50|$|This gate {{also was}} known in {{different}} periods, as Arc of the Ears, Bib-Arrambla <b>gate,</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Hands, <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Pesos, <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Horse, or <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> the Sandland, this latter in times of Moorish occupation, area known by that name due the sand lands nearly Darro River, which vied horse racing. In Muslim era it was known as door Bab-Al-Rambla, there has derived the present name of the plaza.
