2500|$|Previously, Bankhead had {{controlled}} the production by not {{showing up for}} rehearsal. Now, Myerberg could simply put Scott in Bankhead's place. Scott has acknowledged that Myerberg used her to keep Bankhead under control and that Bankhead was furious about the situation. Describing her own experience with Bankhead, Scott recalled, [...] "She never spoke to me, except to bark out commands. Finally, one day, I'd had enough. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say 'please,' and after that she did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll get her," [...] replied Wade, triumphantly. [...] "Collie's {{with him}} now. I sent her. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> tell Wils how {{you tried to}} force her--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was busy}} with the dog," [...] Lady Lydiard answered. [...] "Isabel Miller was of no use in the boudoir, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> seal it for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} bent an eye of lack-lustre {{compassion}} on the girl, who replied, [...] "Oh, yes. I know that; it's what <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>I</b> didn't want it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{may make}} Darpent deserve a fresh creation, then,' he answered, smiling sadly. 'It will {{be best to}} wait a little, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> see how matters turn out at home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I stayed {{talking with}} her for about half an hour; then I left her, as she seemed ready to go <b>to</b> bed; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> maid <b>to</b> listen at the door in about an hour's time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She's got it across,' Bat whispered. 'I've {{never seen}} her like this. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> light up the star, but I was wrong, and she knew it. She's an artist.' ...|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} at me, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> shut her left eye, {{but to be}} very {{particular}} not to turn around again without lowering her pistol.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Albert's wife {{wants to}} call the baby after Brusiloff,' she said, 'but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{wait and see what}} becomes of him first. Them Russians has such a habit of petering out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I at once fetched the chloroform, the inhaler, {{and a pair}} of forceps {{which looked}} well suited for the purpose, and {{probably}} were intended for it. <b>I</b> then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lie down on the angareb, which I placed close to the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've desired Hetty to {{remember}} as she's got to dance wi' you, sir," [...] said the good innocent woman; [...] "for she's so thoughtless, she'd be like {{enough to go}} an' engage herself for ivery dance. So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> promise too many." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very fond;--ha, ha! Corporal, you wag you--and so she IS very fond. Yesterday, {{after the}} knife-and-beer scene--no wonder I threw the liquor in her face: {{it was so}} dev'lish flat that no gentleman could drink it: and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> never <b>to</b> draw it till dinner-time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{shall have}} her own way,--as she ought. What that way is I do not know. I have not even asked about it. She asked me, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hope you}} will change your mind some day, but yon must do {{something}} this afternoon. You had better take a walk with Susan and baby; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go by the meadows to Horton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will wait}} and wait, mother, for she always keeps her word, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> hold on till I came," [...] {{explained}} Mac, with {{visions of a}} shivering little figure watching on the windy hill-top.|$|E
60|$|I signed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on. If I had {{answered}} in words, <b>I</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave the room.|$|R
50|$|She {{liked the}} {{paintings}} too. But when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wanted <b>to</b> paint <b>her</b> as {{she appeared in}} SwanLake, she sadly shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm quite willing! I think a good {{downfall}} plump {{would be}} the most wholesome thing that could happen to her; and besides, <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take the man for her almoner and counsellor! I may have pointed to the gulf, but I never bade Curtia leap into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A week! And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{expect me}} Monday afternoon. A week {{without a word}} or a sign of any kind! Well, I might as well take passage in the Aroostook, {{and go back to}} Boston again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lina looked. It has not. I {{should have}} {{expected}} as much. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> note that point very unobtrusively, {{so as to}} avoid giving the police the clue. She saw the machine in the outer hall as usual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{not here}} when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stay," [...] {{retorted}} Marilla. [...] "I reckon she'll {{find it hard}} to explain THAT to my satisfaction. Of course I knew you'd take her part, Matthew. But I'm bringing her up, not you." ...|$|E
60|$|Afterwards Freydisa {{asked me}} what was the dream of which I had spoken, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> it <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> every word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandfather, {{this letter}} is from my aunt. She wishes me to go and live with her and prepare for the stage. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wished <b>to</b> do so. I am going." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea being, of course, that as at {{that time}} I {{was more or less}} {{dependent}} on Uncle Willoughby I couldn't very well marry without his approval. And though I knew he wouldn't have any objection to Florence, having known her father since they were at Oxford together, I hadn't wanted to take any chances; so <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make an effort to fascinate the old boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah, bah! There ain't no danger, gentlefolks," [...] said Mr. Krook, looking {{slowly and}} sharply {{from one to}} another until he had looked at all of us; [...] "she'd never offer at the birds when I was here unless <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I promised {{and vowed}} {{many things in}} your name to that {{secretary}} person, the female one--not Mennick--if she would help us. Nothing doing. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> let us have Ogden as soon as possible, C.O.D., and she withered me with a glance and went.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} maid-servant {{had shut}} the door, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> inform her master that I wanted {{to say a word}} to him in private. She showed me into the parlor behind the shop, and there was Mr. Yatman all alone, reading the newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell whether}} she's sick or not. I went <b>to</b> see about <b>her</b> and she motioned me away, and fairly screamed when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she ought <b>to</b> keep {{out in the}} air. Well, I must be going up again myself, or--" ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the first}} {{occasion}} in Beaucourt's experience of his married life, his wife wrote to him instead of speaking to him, {{although they were}} both in {{the house at the}} time. It was a little note only containing these words: [...] "I thought you would like to say good-by to Mrs. Evelin. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> expect you in the library, and I will take care that you are not disturbed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, {{for your}} sake," [...] said George, busily tying his dollar round Tom's neck; [...] "but there, now, button your coat tight over it, and keep it, and remember, {{every time you}} see it, that I'll come down after you, and bring you back. Aunt Chloe and I {{have been talking about}} it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> fear; I'll see to it, and I'll tease father's life out, if he don't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{hearing the}} lady's {{narrative}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try change of air, which she declined as cowardly. So, {{as she would}} stay on at Mr. Buckley's, I suggested that an electric alarm communicating with Miss Buckley's room should be rigged up, and this was done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ma'am, I guess he's right; she was {{too proud}} to bear that long. It's like her to kill herself. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to,</b> {{if there was no}} other way; an' she always minded me, Lucy did. My poor girl! Oh, it warn't right! No, by God, it warn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said there}} was a little girl living with him. He used to send her out to beg. He got it into his head that she had set me against him, and he started to beat her. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> run away, and then he {{attacked}} me and got arrested." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{she seemed}} <b>to</b> be so {{perfectly}} sensible of my condition, that I had nothing <b>to</b> ask of <b>her</b> but this, that as <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> had money sufficient, {{but not a}} great quantity, she would order it so that I might be at as little superfluous charge as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She heard me, and ran in. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> {{come near}} us till he was dead. He {{came in and}} first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck {{at me with a}} whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his skill for his life.' ...|$|R
5000|$|He added, [...] "After A {{wrote the}} post drunk, she checked it again {{a few hours}} later and said that she thought she made a mistake. Since she wrote it in a {{personal}} space, I didn't think there would be any problems. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> think about it, and hung up. I don't want to sue an old friend. If the writings are true, I'd be embarrassed, but I didn't live my life like that. But it's true that MR.MR's image was hurt by this. So I decided to leave MR.MR." ...|$|R
