Seaman Alphonso McPherson <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

25|$|Connecticut {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} the Pennsylvania portion (Westmoreland County) of its sea-to-sea land grant following the Yankee-Pennamite Wars and the intercession of the federal government. Nevertheless, the state <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> its claim on the lands between the 41st and 42nd-and-2-minutes parallels that lay west of the Pennsylvania border.|$|E

[...] He <b>held</b> her <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> {{his breast}} {{and began to}} walk away with her. His throbbing, muscular power seemed {{completely}} to envelop her. He was just walking away with her down the road, clinging <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> her, enveloping her.|$|R
25|$|The {{importance}} of the minhag ("prevailing local custom") is also a point of dispute between Karo and Isserles: while Karo <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> original authorities and material reasons, Isserles considered the minhag {{as an object of}} great importance, and not to be omitted in a codex. This point, especially, induced Isserles to write his glosses to the Shulchan Aruch, that the customs (minhagim) of the Ashkenazim might be recognized, and not be set aside through Karo's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists mostly {{dealt with}} topics other than {{original}} sin. The doctrine {{of original sin}} was first developed in 2nd-century Bishop of Lyon Irenaeus's struggle against Gnosticism. The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> belief that man, though fallen, is free. It was in the West that precise definition of the doctrine arose.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao {{followed}} this advice and <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> his ground. In the ninth month, Xun Yu {{pointed out that}} Yuan Shao had been storing supplies at a depot {{in the village of}} Gushi (故市; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan), guarded by Han Meng. Cao Cao sent out small cavalry units led by Xu Huang and Shi Huan (史渙) to attack this position. They succeeded, routing Han Meng, disrupting Yuan Shao's supply lines, and burning his grain carts. Yuan Shao was forced to call for relief supplies in response to this raid.|$|E
60|$|The eventful day {{of trial}} came. The public were gathered, {{impatient}} and scornful as the pig-headed public are apt to be. In the open area a long cylindrical balloon, in shape like a Bologna sausage, swayed above the machine, from which, like some enormous bird caught in a net, it tried to free itself. A heavy rope <b>held</b> it <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the ground.|$|R
500|$|On 21 February 1915 Endurance, still <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> drifted <b>to</b> {{her most}} southerly latitude, 76°58′S. Thereafter she began {{moving with the}} pack in a northerly direction. [...] On 24 February Shackleton {{realised}} {{that they would be}} held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship’s routine abandoned. [...] The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or [...] "dogloos", and the ship’s interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.|$|R
6000|$|He was not mistaken; for, when spring budded, {{his dream}} came true, {{and in the}} little sewing-girl, who bound him with a silken thread so soft and strong it never broke, he found an anchor that <b>held</b> him <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> {{happiness}} and home. To Letty something wonderful happened at last. The prince came when most she needed him; and, though even when the beggar's rags fell off his only crown was the old hat, his royal robes red flannel and fustian, his sceptre a sledge-hammer, she knew and loved him, for ...|$|R
25|$|Whigs favored {{economic}} expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats {{were opposed to}} all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote the general welfare. The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and of moral and economic coercion, <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the menace}} of Rupert's cavalry, {{to which he}} had nothing to oppose, Essex withdrew to Bedfordshire in July. He made no attempt to {{intercept}} the march of the Queen's convoys, permitting the Oxford army, which he should have <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> <b>to</b> intervene effectually in the Midlands, the west, and the south-west. Waller might well complain that Essex, who still held Reading and the Chilterns, had given him neither active nor passive support in the critical days, preceding Roundway Down. Still, only a few voices were raised to demand his removal, and he was shortly to have an opportunity of proving his skill and devotion in a great campaign and a great battle.|$|E
25|$|Following her husband's death, Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad {{similar to}} those of a nun. These vows {{included}} celibacy, as well as complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual director. Konrad's treatment of Elizabeth was extremely harsh, and he held her to standards of behavior which were almost impossible to meet. Among the punishments he is alleged to have ordered were physical beatings; he also ordered her to send away her three children. Her pledge to celibacy proved a hindrance to her family's political ambitions. Elizabeth was more or less held hostage at Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle, Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, in an effort to force her to remarry. Elizabeth, however, <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> her vow, even threatening to cut off her own nose so that no man would find her attractive enough to marry.|$|E
60|$|Now the priestess was {{standing}} in front of the beast-god, apparently quite without fear, though her two attendants had fallen back. Ragnall sprang forward as though to drag her away, but a dozen men leapt on to him and <b>held</b> him <b>fast,</b> either <b>to</b> save his life or for some secret reason of their own which I never learned.|$|R
6000|$|He made a {{sound that}} was almost a groan, and dropped on his knees. Feeling herself <b>held</b> <b>fast,</b> she tried <b>to</b> push his {{forehead}} back from her waist. It was fiery hot; and she heard him mutter: [...] "Have mercy! Love me a little!" [...] But the clutch of his hands, never still on the thin silk of her dress, turned her faint. She tried to writhe away, but could not; stood still again, and at last found her voice.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the storm}} it ignited, former President Carter <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> on Thursday <b>to</b> his {{accusation}} that Israel oppresses the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza {{and seeks to}} colonize the land. Speaking at The George Washington University to a polite but mostly critical student audience, Carter offered no second thoughts on his book [...] "Palestine Peace Not Apartheid". ... He {{said he was not}} accusing Israel of racism nor referring to its treatment of Arabs within the country. [...] "I defined apartheid very carefully" [...] as [...] "the forced segregation by one people of another" [...] on their own land, he said.|$|R
25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on {{the small of his back}} and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In essence Spencer's {{philosophical}} {{vision was}} formed {{by a combination of}} deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father {{and other members of the}} Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Thrasybulus was {{a capable}} general, {{particularly}} successful in naval warfare, and a competent speaker, but was frequently overshadowed or pushed aside by more charismatic or spectacularly successful leaders. [...] Buck has compared him to Winston Churchill, another advocate of imperial policies who <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> his beliefs after {{the tide of}} history had turned against him, and who rose to his peak of prominence at his country's darkest hour. [...] Throughout his two decades of prominence, whether {{in or out of}} leadership, Thrasybulus remained a steady advocate of traditional Athenian imperial democracy, and he died fighting for the same cause he was advocating on his first appearance in 411.|$|E
50|$|Forty {{years before}} the Battle of Valmy, can one {{therefore}} already see the assertion of a national identity facing the threat of cultural imperialism? In fact {{the concept of a}} nation proposed here only represented the Parisian microcosm, that is to say the court's good graces, thus the good will of the monarch. On the other hand, Italian opera showed an aesthetic form in itself which was no longer only Italian but European, or at least international, since numerous composers of the genre were not Italians. The Germans like Melchior Grimm and Baron d'Holbach were among the most fervent adherents of Italian opera. Fr. Castel's statements <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> because, <b>to</b> the eighteenth century royal court, only France could claim to be the dominant nation in Europe. And the most bellicose or defensive statements emanated from the supporters of the French genre.|$|R
50|$|An {{exposition}} and refutation of {{the main}} doctrines of Christianity. This treatise was written in Catalan in 1398. The Catalan original is no longer extant; but a Hebrew translation by Joseph ibn Shem-Tov, with the title ("Refutation of the Cardinal Principles of the Christians"), has been preserved. The work was composed at the solicitation of Spanish noblemen. Crescas' object in writing what is virtually an apologetic treatise on Judaism was to present the reasons which <b>held</b> the Jews <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> their ancestral faith.|$|R
60|$|Cornelia {{had always}} brought him on as vigorously as she could; and Paul {{had had a}} hard life of it. But {{over and above the}} getting through his tasks, he had long had another purpose always present to him, and to which he still <b>held</b> <b>fast.</b> It was, <b>to</b> be a gentle, useful, quiet little fellow, always striving to secure the love and {{attachment}} of the rest; and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs, or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window, he was oftener found, too, among the other boys, modestly rendering them some little voluntary service. Thus it came to pass, that even among those rigid and absorbed young anchorites, who mortified themselves beneath the roof of Doctor Blimber, Paul was an object of general interest; a fragile little plaything that they all liked, and that no one would have thought of treating roughly. But he could not change his nature, or rewrite the analysis; and so they all agreed that Dombey was old-fashioned.|$|R
500|$|While the Democratic-Republicans had {{supported}} states' rights, {{in the wake}} of the War of 1812 many members urged a stronger central government. A majority in Congress wanted to see the federal government help to fund internal improvements such as ports and roadways. Tyler <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> his strict constructionist beliefs, rejecting such proposals on both constitutional and personal grounds. He believed each state should construct necessary projects within its borders using locally generated funds. Virginia was not [...] "in so poor a condition as to require a charitable donation from Congress," [...] he contended. He was chosen to participate in an audit of the Second Bank of the United States in 1818 as part of a five-man committee, and was appalled by corruption he perceived within the bank. He argued for the revocation of the bank charter, although Congress rejected any such proposal. His first clash with General Andrew Jackson followed Jackson's 1818 invasion of Florida during the First Seminole War. While praising Jackson's character, Tyler condemned him as overzealous for the execution of two British subjects. Tyler was elected for a full term without opposition in early 1819.|$|E
2500|$|Vikernes' {{trial began}} on 2 May 1994; he was {{represented}} by the lawyer Stein-Erik Mattsson. Many {{other members of the}} scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were put on trial around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. According to Lords of Chaos, [...] "Vikernes is disgusted by the fact that, while he <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> a code of silence, others confessed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few new priests {{were trained}} in the 1790-1814 period, and many left the church. The result was {{that the number of}} parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly. [...] Entire regions, {{especially}} around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand, some traditional regions <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the faith, led by local nobles and historic families.|$|E

2500|$|During his tenure, {{his primary}} thrust (and {{that of the}} seminary) was an {{authoritative}} view of the Bible. This view was held {{in contrast to the}} emotionalism of the revival movements, the rationalism of higher criticism, and the heterodox teachings of various New religious movements that were emerging. [...] The seminary <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> the Reformed confessional tradition [...] that is, it faithfully followed the Westminster Confession of Faith.|$|E
2500|$|Moses exhorted the Israelites to heed God's laws, not to add {{anything}} to them, {{and not to}} take anything away from them, {{so that they might}} live to enter and occupy the land that God was giving them. Moses noted that in the sin of Baal-peor, God wiped out every person who followed Baal-peor, while preserving alive those who <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> God.

2500|$|In Hermann Hesse's novel Steppenwolf (1927) the {{isolated}} and tormented protagonist – a namesake {{of the wolf}} – consoles himself at one point by recalling a scene that the author might have beheld during his travels: [...] "(...) that slender cypress on the hill over Gubbio that, though split and riven by a fall of stone, yet <b>held</b> <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> life and put forth with its last resources a new sparse tuft at the top".|$|E

60|$|Slashing {{through the}} laces I dragged off one boot. Its heel was heavy and might serve for a mallet, {{and holding the}} blade of my knife on the top strand close against a post, I smote it furiously. The wire was not nicked half through when it burst beneath the pressure, and a barb on its flying end scored my face so that the blood trickled into my mouth and eyes; but the next wire was of treble twist, and as I struck and choked I regretted the {{thoroughness}} with which we had built the fence. The knife chipped under the blows I rained upon it, and when I shortened the blade its end snapped off. In a fit of desperation I seized the lacerating wires with my naked fingers and tore at them frenziedly, but what {{the pressure on the}} other side failed to accomplish the strength of twenty men might not do, so when in a few seconds reason returned to me I picked up what remained of the knife and set to work again. There was still no sign of Thorn, and as the wires did not slacken it was plain that Steel had failed to loose the straining screws without convenient tools. Three slender cords of steel alone pent in the stock that were to set me free of debt, but I had no implements with which to break them, so they also <b>held</b> me <b>fast</b> <b>to</b> be dragged down helpless to beggary.|$|R
