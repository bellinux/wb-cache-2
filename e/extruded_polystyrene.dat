Because of the extrusion manufacturing process, XPS does not require facers to maintain its thermal or physical property performance.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the {{ignition}} capability of welding slag to <b>polystyrene</b> <b>extruded</b> board of B 2 grade, the ignition process was simulated by changing the splash direction of welding slag, the initial distance between the extruded board surface and triangular iron, {{as well as the}} shape of extruded board. The results show that the ignition capability of horizontal and vertical welding slag at the distance of less than 6 cm are similar, while at the distance of 6 cm, the ignition capability of vertical welding slag is higher than that of horizontal welding slag. The shape of the extruded board (blocks or chippings) has little influence on the ignition capability of vertical welding slag within the range of 6 cm. It is believed that the conclusions of this study can provide some references for fire investigation related to the ignition capability of welding slag to <b>polystyrene</b> <b>extruded</b> board...|$|R

40|$|Blends of CO 2 ̆ 082 and n-pentane were <b>extruded</b> in <b>polystyrene.</b> Rheological {{characterization}} of the system using the on-line slit die showed that n-pentane is a more effective plasticizer than CO 2 ̆ 082 on an equivalent molar basis. This {{is consistent with previous}} findings indicating that larger gas molecules create more internal spacing at the molecular level. Solubility and homogeneity of the blends was also probed using ultrasonic monitoring. It was observed that degassing pressure in CO 2 ̆ 082 /n-pentane blends was CO 2 ̆ 082 -dependant only. This feature enables to increase the global gas loading in a foaming system in order to improve the expansion ratio without compromising on the gas pressure exiting the die, which may cause extrusion defects. Moreover, adding a lower diffusing agent such as n-pentane is expected to decrease the overall diffusion rate of the blend. Foam characterization results revealed that incorporating n-pentane to CO 2 ̆ 082 lowered the density further while producing foam samples comtaining virtually no open-cells as compared to its pure CO 2 ̆ 082 counterpart.

40|$|Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), {{as one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{brominated}} flame retardants (BFRs), is of great concern globally because of its persistence in the environment and negative impacts on humans and animals. HBCDD has been mainly used in flame-retarded expanded (EPS) and <b>extruded</b> (XPS) <b>polystyrene</b> foams for insulation in the construction industry. Most of these products will become a part of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste at the end of their life cycle (30 - 50 years) which is typically disposed of into landfills or incineration. However, the recycling of this material takes quite a low share compared with landfill and incineration. Consequently, high environmental risks will exist in these disposal approaches due to the HBCDD in C&D waste. Currently, XPS or EPS products containing HBCDD in the construction industry have not reached the end of their life cycle in most countries. Relatively little attention has been paid to this emergency issue by either the government or public. Furthermore, C&D waste is most likely disposed of by direct dumping, simple stacking, or open burning in developing countries. Therefore, this paper highlights the global environmental risks of HBCDD from C&D waste. Areas of research for key problems of HBCDD contained in C&D waste are suggested to help control and finally eliminate the impact...|$|R

40|$|Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) is a {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} (BFR) and major additive to polystyrene foam thermal insulation that has recently been listed as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention. During a 2013 / 2014 field analytical survey, we measured HBCDD content ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 4 % by weight in 98 polystyrene samples. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses indicated that expandable (EPS) and <b>extruded</b> (XPS) <b>polystyrene</b> foams significantly differed in the α/γ HBCDD isomer ratio, with a majority of α and γ isomers in XPS and EPS, respectively. Interestingly, this technique indicated that some recent materials did not contain HBCDD, but demonstrated bromine content when analysed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Further investigation by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was able to discriminate between the BFRs present. In addition to confirming the absence or presence of HBCDD in polystyrene samples, high-field NMR spectroscopy provided evidence {{of the use of}} brominated butadiene styrene (BBS) as copolymer in the production of polystyrene. Use of this alternative flame retardant is expected to cause fewer health and environmental concerns. Our results highlight a trend towards the use of copolymerized BFRs as an alternative to HBCDD in polystyrene foam boards. In addition to providing a rapid NMR method to identify polymeric BFR, our analytical approach is a simple method to discriminate between flame-retardants in polystyrene foam insulating materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{compressed}} closed-cell {{polymer foam}} was modelled using a BBC lattice model of tetrakaidecahedral cells, loaded in the [001] direction. The contributions of cell face tensions and edge bending were analysed, {{assuming that the}} faces act as membranes, for a linearly-elastic, or a yielding material. The moduli and tensile yield stresses of highly oriented polymer films were measured to provide data for modelling, {{and the amount of}} polymer in the foam cell faces found to be high. Tensile face strains are predicted to reach 40 % of the foam compressive strain. The predicted Youngs moduli are slightly low, because compressive face stresses are ignored, but Poissons ratio is correctly predicted. The compressive foam yield stress is predicted to depend on tensile yielding of the cell faces. Predicted values are close to experimental values for polyethylene foams, but half those of <b>polystyrene</b> <b>extruded</b> foams. The latter foam may collapse in compression when face yielding commences, rather than by the collapse mechanism of the model...|$|R
40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the main}} fig fruits {{producers}} in the World. The protection of the fig fruit quality in the chains from harvesting to marketing is very important. Vibration often causes some damages to perishable fruits in transportation and reduces their quality. The fruit injury due to vibration is related to the transportation characteristics of vehicles, packaging boxes and the conditions of the roads. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of packaging box by different materials to decrease the damages of vertical vibration on the quality of three fresh fig varieties (Yediveren, Sarilop and Bursa Black) during transportation. The experiments were carried out in two stages. In the first stage; the frequency and acceleration values of truck were determined during the real transportation. In the second stage, these values were applied on the simulator (shaker) to examine the effect of vibration on fresh figs packaged with three different boxes. The results showed that the cardboard packaging box was not proper for transporting of the fresh fig fruits in all road conditions. The mass loss of fresh fig fruits packed with cardboard box were found to be 2. 5 times more than <b>extruded</b> and expanded <b>polystyrene</b> boxes at 16 Hz frequency and 2. 54 m s- 2 acceleration.

40|$|Various super-insulated {{retrofit}} strategies {{with high}} R-value wall assemblies {{have been proposed}} and investigated in North America since the energy crisis in the early 70 s. Even today, research and development activities in high thermal performance building envelopes have been very popular due to increased concerns on issues related to installed costs, environmental impacts (sustainable or green construction), saving additional building energy consumption (zero net energy building), and higher thermal and occupant comfort expectations. In {{order to reduce the}} heating and cooling demand in structures, it is often more cost effective to retrofit existing building envelopes with the addition of improved fenestration. This paper explores the optimum location of replacement windows in retrofit applications with thicker building wall systems due to the addition of insulation to existing walls. Replacement windows may be installed at different depths in the wall aperture (e. g., close to the interior, in the middle, or close to the exterior of the window opening). This work discusses the best thermally performing locations to install the replacement windows in two cases of high R-value wall retrofits: those using vacuum insulation panels and those using the thick layer of conventional plastic foam insulation (e. g., <b>extruded</b> or expanded <b>polystyrene).</b> Finite difference and finite element computer modeling is utilized to analyze the thermal zone of influence around the window openings and to determine the most energy-efficient position to install the window. In order to differentiate between the different window installation systems, the linear thermal transmittance of the windowwall connection, as determined by ISO 10211 (2007 b) is also calculated and presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an improved numerical simulation study of an isothermal chamber recently constructed at Zografou Campus of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) for {{the testing of}} special equipment used for transporting perishable foodstuffs {{in accordance with the}} United Nations ATP agreement. Using a transient finite difference model, a simulation is developed for a modern ATP test chamber and a typical specimen refrigerated vehicle to be tested. The simulation results are compared to experimental measurements taken under real conditions by a data acquisition system and a refrigerated semitrailer as specimen. Proportional-integral control is employed for the regulation of the cooling and heating system. The impact of various parameters on the time required to reach the set-point temperature (is,,) is investigated and the energy consumption is simulated for a period of 22 h. In particular, the impact of specimen insulation thickness and the thickness of the chamber insulation floor are considered in detail. The total energy consumption increases by approximately 16 % when the concrete floor layer thickness is increased from 8 to 16 cm for typical initial conditions and desired chamber and specimen temperatures of 32. 5 and 7. 5 degreesC, respectively. Using a floor insulation of 6 cm <b>extruded</b> heavy strain-resistant <b>polystyrene</b> reduces the energy consumption by at least 13 %. Specimen insulation thickness increase from U-value of 0. 35 Wm(- 2) K to 0. 75 W m(- 2) K result to an increase in energy consumption by a percentage of 28 %. Thermal capacity, temperature of car body and specimen dimensions are also treated as variables that affect the total duration of an ATP test and its total energy consumption.
