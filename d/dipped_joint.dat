30|$|Improving freight {{axle load}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} method to improve railway freight capability; based on the imported technologies of railway freight bogie, the 27  t axle load side-frame cross-bracing bogie and sub-frame radial bogie are developed in China. In order to analyze and compare dynamic interactions of the two newly developed heavy-haul freight bogies, we establish a vehicle–track coupling dynamic model and use numerical calculation methods for computer simulation. The dynamic performances of the two bogies are simulated separately at various conditions. The results show that at the <b>dipped</b> <b>joint</b> and straight line running conditions, the wheel–rail dynamic interactions of both bogies are basically the same, but at the curve negotiation condition, the wear and the lateral force of the side-frame cross-bracing bogie are much higher than that of the sub-frame radial bogie, and the advantages become more obvious when the curve radius is smaller. The results also indicate that the sub-frame radial bogie has better low-wheel–rail interaction characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Cracks in railway {{prestressed}} concrete sleepers are often {{caused by the}} infrequent but high magnitude impact forces. These impact forces are attributed to the wheel or rail abnormalities, e. g. wheel flat, corrugation, <b>dipped</b> <b>joint,</b> etc. The emphasis {{of this paper is}} placed on the corresponding fractures of railway {{prestressed concrete}} sleepers in track systems under the probabilistic impact loadings. The statistical data of impact loadings in Central Queensland have been obtained through the collaborative project under the research framework of the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Railway Engineering and Technologies. It is found that for the heavy haul railway network, the track structures, especially the concrete sleepers, may experience the impact loading from 400 kN up to 800 kN. The corresponding probabilities of such load occurrences are ranging from one in twenty years to one in thousands of years. It is very important for the design and maintenance perspectives to investigate the impact behaviour of concrete sleepers under the impact loadings. This paper presents the impact fractures of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under the single impact loading associated with the probability of occurrence in the soft track environment. Visual interfacial cracks have been evaluated for the crack length and width along the sleepers in relation to the probability of load occurrence...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{mallet finger}} that is treated with {{isolated}} splinting of the distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint</b> {{can be moved}} freely proximal to the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint,</b> we sought to determine whether such motion might cause a tendon gap that could explain the extensor lag that often follows treatment. Experiments were performed on 32 cadaveric fingers with open mallet finger lesions, immobilizing either the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> alone or both the <b>DIP</b> and PIP <b>joints,</b> while repeatedly flexing and extending the more proximal finger and wrist joints. For each experiment, {{the gap in the}} extensor tendon was measured.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> OA {{is common}} but has few cost-effective, {{evidence-based}} interventions. Pain and deformity [radial or ulnar deviation {{of the joint}} or loss of full extension (extension lag) ] frequently lead to functional and cosmetic issues. We investigated whether splinting the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> would improve pain, function and deformity. METHODS: A prospective, radiologist-blinded, non-randomized, internally controlled trial of custom splinting of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> was carried out. Twenty-six subjects with painful, deforming <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> hand OA gave written, informed consent. One intervention joint and one control joint were nominated. A custom gutter splint was worn nightly for 3 months on the intervention joint, with clinical and radiological assessment at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Differences in the change were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The median average pain at baseline was similar in the intervention (6 / 10) and control joints (5 / 10). Average pain (primary outcome measure) and worst pain in the intervention joint were significantly lower at 3 months compared with baseline (P = 0. 002, P = 0. 02).

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{understanding}} of finger functionality {{associated with the}} specific muscle is mostly based on the functional anatomy, and the exact motion effect associated with an individual muscle is still unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine phalangeal joints motion of the index finger generated by each extrinsic muscle. Methods Ten (6 female and 4 male) fresh-frozen cadaveric hands (age 55. 2 ± 5. 6 years) were minimally dissected to establish baseball sutures at the musculotendinous junctions of the index finger extrinsic muscles. Each tendon was loaded to 10 % of its force potential and the motion generated at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joints</b> was simultaneously recorded using a marker-based motion capture system. Results The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) generated average flexion of 19. 7, 41. 8, and 29. 4 degrees at the MCP, PIP, and <b>DIP</b> <b>joints,</b> respectively. The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) generated average flexion of 24. 8 and 47. 9 degrees at the MCP and PIP joints, respectively, and no motion at the <b>DIP</b> <b>joints.</b> The extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and extensor indicis proprius (EIP) generated average extension of 18. 3, 15. 2, 4. 0 degrees and 15. 4, 13. 2, 3. 7 degrees at the MCP, PIP and <b>DIP</b> <b>joints,</b> respectively. The FDP generated simultaneous motion at the PIP and <b>DIP</b> <b>joints.</b> However, the motion generated by the FDP and FDS, at the MCP joint lagged the motion generated at the PIP joint. The EDC and EIP generated simultaneous motion at the MCP and PIP joints.

40|$|The role of {{enthesitis}} in {{the pathogenesis}} of psoriatic arthritis has been increasingly recognised in the last twenty years. High resolution imaging techniques and histology {{have shown that the}} distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint</b> extensor tendon is directly anchored to the nail. More recently, it has become apparent that a significant proportion of asymptomatic psoriasis patients have subclinical enthesitis at sites such as the Achilles tendon. This thesis explored the hypothesis that nail disease without clinical arthritis was associated with <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> enthesopathy and that nail disease equated with remote systemic enthesopathy. Imaging studies utilising magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> confirmed the relationship between enthesitis and nail disease in psoriatic arthritis, and found subtle enthesitis and osteitis in psoriasis patients. High resolution ultrasound that has an intrinsically greater resolution than MRI showed extensor tendon enthesopathy of the DIP to be common in psoriasis patients with nail disease, but not those without nail disease. It was also shown that nail disease in psoriasis patients without arthritis was associated with sonographically-determined remote enthesopathy in the lower limbs. In a small pilot study (N= 9), despite clinical improvements MRI showed ongoing inflammation in and around the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> after six months treatment with a TNF inhibitor.

40|$|Arthrodesis of {{the distal}} {{interphalangeal}} (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint</b> is a reliable means of achieving pain relief in a symptomatic <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> afflicted {{by a variety}} of degenerative, inflammatory, or posttraumatic conditions. Successful arthrodesis is more reproducible when rigid compression of the joint is achieved. The emergence of an increasing number of commercially available headless or variable pitch compression screws reflects the growing trend among hand surgeons to utilize rigid stabilization of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> so that motion at more proximal levels can be initiated immediately without affecting arthrodesis rates. Successful closed percutaneous DIP arthrodesis can be achieved in a patient with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, passively correctable deformity, and patients at increased risk for perioperative soft tissue complications associated with open arthrodesis.

40|$|To reduce {{pressure}} in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> a communication should be created from the digital sheath to the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> This allows increased synovial fluid to flow out of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> into the digital sheath. As a synovial fistula it should be durable in decreasing the {{pressure in}} the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to show the anatomical relationship of the structures in question as well as a comparison of the possible surgical methods. Surgical access, effectiveness and complications will be discussed. This study is based on anatomical studies of 41 leg cadavers and 3 different surgical methods. The 41 front leg cadavers for the experiment were from horses that had to be euthanised at the Equine Department of the Veterinary Hospital of the Free University of Berlin or from a local abbatoir. The cadaver included all breeds other than ponies, any gender, age and bodyweight. They were all front legs, resected in the carpal area. In the anatomical study access through the disto palmar pouch of the digital sheath could be tested. The aim is an opening of 2. 5 cm by 1. 2 cm as a result of the surgical separation of connective and elastic tissues in between both structures. All three surgical methods are minimal invasive and achieve the desired reduction of {{pressure in the}} <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> A bi manual method controlled by tendinovaginoskopy proved to be very safe. Difficulties were due to tight spaces within the digital sheath. The method with fluoroscopy had the advantage of a single access site only, but time and technical expenses werent in relation to that. The third method without any visual control was the easiest and without the need of technical equipment but needed a detailed knowledge of the anatomical structures and surgical experience in this approach. The choice of instruments for the tissue separation depends on the surgical methods and the long term reactions to HF surgery. HF surgical instruments should not be used without visual control. Further evaluation is needed to see if there is an advantage to coagulating incisions regarding their durability. A control study with in vivo pressure applied to the distal phalanx proved effectiveness of the surgical principle. Due to the described possible complications this surgical procedure should be used only in chronic and therapy resistant cases.

Methods: Pilot prospective single-centre study of eight ultrasonography parameters in B mode and power Doppler concerning the distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint,</b> the matrix, the bed and nail plate. Intraobserver and inter-observer reliability was evaluated for the seven quantitative parameters (ICC and kappa). Correlations between ultrasonography and clinical variables were searched to assess external validity. Feasibility was assessed by the time to carry out the examination and the percentage of missing data. Results: Twenty-seven patients with psoriatic arthritis (age 55. 0 +/- 16. 2 years, disease duration 13. 4 +/- 9. 4 years) were included. Of these, 67 % presented nail involvement on ultrasonography vs 37 % on physical examination (P 0. 75) for the seven quantitative parameters, except for synovitis of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> in B mode. The synovitis of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> revealed by ultrasonography correlated with the total number of clinical synovitis and Doppler US of the nail (matrix and bed). Doppler US of the matrix correlated with VAS pain but not with the ASDAS-CRP or with clinical enthesitis. No significant correlation was found with US nail thickness. Conclusion: The feasibility and reliability of ultrasonography of the nail in psoriatic arthritis appear to be satisfactory. Among the eight parameters evaluated, power Doppler of the matrix which correlated with local inflammation (<b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> and bed) and with VAS pain could become an interesting outcome measure, provided that it is also sensitive to change.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{designed}} to prove {{the value of the}} direct manometry in the navicular bursa. The objective was to use this technique as a further help in diagnosing navicular bursitis. The proper technique for puncturing the navicular bursa was worked outin the first instance. The easiest method was the puncture from the palmar aspect of the foot. The needle is inserted approximately 5 mm above the coronary band between the heel bulbs and is directed forward towards a point located approximately 2 cm distal to the coronary band at the dorsal hoof wall. The tip of the needle lays within the navicular bursa when hard resistance is encountered. Radiography to control the position of the needle is obsolete, because the pressure measured gives a hint regarding the orientation of the needle. To determine the physiological pressure in the navicular bursa eight clinical and radiological sound horses were examined during the main studies. Altogether the pressure was taken 11 times. There pressures up to 6 mmHg measured; further examinations revealed pressure values of more than 6 mm Hg, which could be considered to be pathological. The pressure in the navicular bursa was taken in 25 patients with symptoms of navicular lameness after diagnostic anaesthesia and radiological examination. In 22 cases the pressure in the distal interphlangeal joint was taken additionally. The evaluation of the pressure rates in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> based on the results from SCHÖTT (1989) and HÖPPNER (1993). It was then attempted to connect the results of the pressure measurement in the navicular bursa with the duration and degree of lameness, the results of diagnostic anaesthesia and radiological findings. In addition pressure rates of the bursa were compared to those of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> Neither the duration or degree of lameness nor radiological results gave a hint to an affection of the navicular bursa. The comparison of the results of diagnostic anaesthesia showed that patients with a positive response to anaesthesia of the pulvinus branch (n = 3) had an increased pressure in the navicular bursa. However, because of the few horses tested a general statemant can not be drawn. During simoultaneous manometry both in the navicular bursa and the distal interphalangeal joint (n = 22) it became obvious that in most cases the intrasynovial pressure increased in only one of these structures. Seven out of 11 patients with an increased pressure in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> showed a normal pressure in the navicular bursa, five out of six horses with a suspicious pressure in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> five had an increased pressure in the bursa and three out of five patients with a normal pressure in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> had an increased pressure in the bursa. These findings show, that in most cases of this study either the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> or the navicular bursa is affected. Only in a few cases both structures were involved. No complications were observed after direct manometry in the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> In two cases lameness increased the day after manometry of the navicular bursa. Soundness returned within 24 hours after application of a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug. All in all the direct manometry in the navicular bursa {{has proved to be a}} simple method with few complications to specify the cause of lameness and for diagnosis of navicular syndrome. After the diagnosis is confirmed a specific local treatment is possible. This lowers the risks of repeated puncture of the navicular bursa, such as infection or trauma of the deep digital flexor tendon...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the intra-articular pressure in horses with chronic distal forelimb lameness. Fifty-six distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joints</b> of the forelimbs of 36 horses were clinically and radiographically investigated in addition to measuring intra-articular pressure. Forty coffin joints of sound horses were used as controls. The peak pressure was registered for each articulation. The mean and Standard deviation pressure measured in sound horses bearing weight on both limbs was 36. 8 ± 16. 0 mm Hg and 69. 6 ± 23. 7 mm Hg when the contra-lateral was raised. In diseased horses the mean and standard deviation pressure measured in the two positions was 66. 5 ± 7. 6 mmHg and 132. 8 ± 43. 3 mm Hg respectively. These results indicate that pressure values of the coffin joint are higher in horses with a painful condition of the distal portion of the forefoot in comparison to normal horses. No correlation was found between articular pressure and the pattern of radiographical changes of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> or distal sesamoid bone. No weight, breed or attitude differences were detected among sound horses and no complications have been reported after pressure measurements. Pressure measurement may be considered as a useful aid to localize pathologic conditions involving the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> or the navicular bone...|$|R

Localization of radiologically detectable pathologies was classified into five anatomical regions: distal radiocarpal/radioulnar, midcarpal, carpometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal, and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal <b>DIP</b> <b>joints.</b> The reader concentrated on describing and counting the relevant lesions, e.g., non-relevant lesions like subtlely rippled articular surfaces were not reported.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{synovial}} fluid concentrations and pharmacokinetics of amikacin in the equine limb distal to the carpus following intraosseous and intravenous regional perfusion. The front limbs of 6 horses were randomly assigned to either intraosseous or intravenous perfusion. A tourniquet was placed distal to each carpus and the limb perfused with 500 mg of amikacin. Systemic blood samples and synovial fluid samples were collected over 70 min from the distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint,</b> metacarpophalangeal joint, and digital flexor sheath. The tourniquet was removed following the 30 min sample collection. The mean peak amikacin concentration for the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> was significantly higher with intravenous perfusion. There were no significant differences in time to peak concentration or elimination half-life between methods at each synovial structure. Each technique produced mean peak concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 times that of recommended peak serum concentrations for therapeutic efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Clinical {{observation}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of a distinct anatomic septum from the extensor tendon to the skin at the distal phalanx that appears to limit the proximal spread of infection from the dorsum of the distal phalanx. This study employed histology and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify this anatomic structure {{at the level of the}} distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joint.</b> Methods We used high-resolution (16. 4 -T) MRI to image and section 10 cadaveric fingers (9 female, 1 male) from both left and right hands. Once imaged, we made histologic sections using hematoxylin and eosin, or Van Gieson 2 ̆ 7 s stain, and examined them microscopically for concordant findings. Results In all 10 scans, the proposed septum was visualized using MRI with histologic confirmation. It was observed to extend from the skin creases overlying the dorsal aspect of the DIP,joint to the extensor tendon. It is composed of collagen bundles arranged in a variable network that adhere extensor tendon to skin at the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> Conclusions Clinical observations proposed the existence of a distinct septum between extensor tendon and skin at the level of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint.</b> We confirmed this structure to be a collagen septum by MRI and histology. This previously undescribed structure is called the dorsal septum. (J Hand Surg 2009; 34 A: 467 - 473.

40|$|A new splint is {{described}} {{for the treatment}} of mallet finger deformity. The splint is in two separate parts which maintain extension of the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> and flexion of the PIP joint respectively. The results of treatment in 25 patients are presented, and are superior in our hands to those resulting from other methods of splintage. The period of treatment is s~o~t~r~ The deformity resulting from rupture or avulsion of the extensor insertion at the distal interphalangeal joint has two components: loss of active extension at the <b>DIP</b> <b>joint,</b> and tightening of the extensor insertion at the PIP joint, leading to swan-neck deformity when laxity of the volar plate allows it to develop. Most splints in current use hold the distal joint in extension and leave the proximal joint free. Previous attempts to combine this with splintage of the PIP joint have employed rigid immobilisation, with the risk of producing a flexion contracture. To avoid this, we have designed a dynami...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the spectral Doppler (SDoppler) to quantify inflammatory activity and to detect nail echotextural differences in patients with psoriatic arthritis and onychomycosis. MethodsTwo patients, one with psoriatic arthritis but with no joint pain nor nail clinical change and the other with onychomycosis and rheumatoid arthritis were included. The gray scale ultrasound study, showed changes in the regular presence of echotexture at the nail insertion, thickening of the nail bed and loss of trilaminar nail pattern. The spectral Dopplerresistance index (RI), detects the inflammatory process in nail entheses. ResultsSeven distal interphalangeal (<b>DIP)</b> <b>joints</b> in both patients were evaluated in two planes, getting nine RI. In the patient with psoriatic arthritis the author found: loss of normal trilaminar nail plate aspect, and nail beds and <b>DIP</b> <b>joint</b> capsules preserved. The spectral Doppler showed RI 1, with mean±SD= 1. 71 ± 0. 98. ConclusionThe use of ultrasound can detect changes in the nail beds in these diseases. Future studies will further characterize these changes...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2003 Georgia Water Resources Conference, held April 23 - 24, 2003, at the University of Georgia. The city of Lawrenceville, Georgia, pumps {{ground water}} mainly from wells {{completed}} {{in a system}} of productive fractures formed parallel to foliation and compositional layering in layered crystalline rocks. Much less production is obtained from planar, more steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>joints</b> intersecting boreholes. The combination of subhorizontal sets of foliation fractures and a well-developed network of steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>joints</b> that connect these fractures to regolith source water creates a fracture system that can sustain large well yields ranging from 100 to 400 gallons per minute (gal/min). Joints and joint sets generally are low yielding and produce water ranging from 1 to 5 gal/min, and in few cases as high as 30 to 35 gal/min where the joint opening is created from dissolution of a pre-existing mineral infilling. Fractures formed from weathering along foliation planes yield water ranging from 1 to 15 gal/min for individual foliation partings and ranging from 50 to 100 gal/min for larger openings. The model presented in this paper indicates that a “weathering wedge” or a zone of weathered rock either originates from the outcrop area or develops from steeply <b>dipping</b> <b>joint</b> systems transmitting water into the bedrock, or a combination of these two. Once a ground-water flow path is established, progressive differential weathering along foliation planes and layering forms zones of increased bedrock permeability. Where foliation fracture systems dominate the flow system, this model could be used to better understand ground-water availability and recharge to bedrock...|$|R
