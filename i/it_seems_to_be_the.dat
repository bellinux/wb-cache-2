Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." [...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll is the sound of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, The Waterboys—have since tried to get back to that place." ...|$|E

The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, Laarbi Maateis, is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism. He also said the prosecution were not understandable [...] "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best for the city." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Aristotle, {{although}} most [...] "belligerent nations" [...] were {{strongly influenced by}} their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (Politics II 1269b). H. D. Rankin in Celts and the Classical World notes that [...] "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does Ammianus (30.9). <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> general opinion of antiquity." [...] In book XIII of his Deipnosophists, the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian Athenaeus, repeating assertions made by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC (Bibliotheca historica 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that [...] "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions {{is likely to be}} Poseidonius and speculates that these authors may be recording male [...] "bonding rituals".|$|E
2500|$|Hegel {{made the}} {{distinction}} between civil society and state in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term [...] "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" [...] though it is now referred to as Zivilgesellschaft in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the dialectical relationship that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community {{of the state and}} the micro-community of the family. Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the political left and right. On the left, it became the foundation for Karl Marx's civil society as an economic base; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between political society and civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville. In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of [...] "lesser" [...] and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.|$|E
