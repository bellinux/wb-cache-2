For each UDP association with endpoints separated by a TLP server, the TLP server performs user-level or host-level authentication, packet filtering, packet relaying, optional network address translation, session logging, timing-out of idle association, and other security-related functions. The core of the TLP is a two-step TLP binding procedure that makes a UDP association stateful between a TLP client and a TLP server. This binding procedure supports Active UDP Open, Passive UDP Open, and Source-Specific UDP Open, which a local program may perform on a UDP socket.

5000|$|In early 1942, {{tests on}} a new and improved, {{completely}} glazed cockpit for the Do 217 series had been underway at the Hamburger Schiffbauanstalt (Hamburg Shipbuilding Institute). E-2s were fitted with a new streamlined [...] "stepless cockpit" [...] following its conceptual debut in January 1938 for the He 111P, as this design philosophy became the standard for almost all German bombers later in World War II, which eliminated the separate windscreen panels for the pilot of earlier versions of the Do 217. The lower nose of the K-version also retained the Bola inverted-casemate gondola for a rearwards-aimed ventral defensive armament emplacement, with its forward end fully incorporated with the new nose glazing design. The testing for this new well-framed cockpit glazing format for the later models of the Do 217, was carried out at the Shipbuilding Institute in Hamburg. The design of the cockpit was {{put to the test}} using water pressure to simulate a speed of 700 km/h. Only a few of the glass panels failed, caused by <b>inadequate</b> <b>mounting.</b> The cabin design passed the tests easily. Initial flights took place on 31 March 1942 after teething problems had been resolved. The Do 217 K V1 flew with BMW 801A-1s from Löwenthal and Erprobungsstelle Rechlin. This was followed by the ten-airframe pre-production batch, Do 217 K-01 to K-010. Mass production of the Do 217 K-1 began at the Dornier factory at Wismar.|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} how cognitive processing of emotionally valenced information may be a vulnerability factor to depression, and to develop a cognitive model of recurrent depression. Several more specific aims were formulated and investigated. To reach the aims of the study, an extensive theoretical review of the research literature on cognitive processes of depression was carried out. Also, we compared never depressed (ND; n = 46), previously depressed (PD; n = 42) and clinically depressed (CD; n = 61) individuals on several questionnaires and experimental tasks including dysphoric symptoms (BDI; Beck et al., 1979), dysfunctional attitudes (DAS; Weissman & Beck, 1978), preferences for positive and negative tape-recorded self-statements (Crowson & Cromwell, 1995), choice preference and reaction time to emotionally valenced words (DOAT; Gotlib, McLachlan, & Katz, 1988; Kakolewski, Crowson, Sewell, & Cromwell, 1999; McCabe & Gotlib, 1995), and free recall, recognition and fabrication of positive and negative self-statements (Wang & Holte, 1995). The main results of the study was: (1) the development of a Cognitive battle model to explain mechanisms involved in recurrent depression; (2) results which seem to indicate that dysfunctional attitudes, in mildly to moderately clinically depressed individuals, may have the potential to decrease the effortful processing of positive stimuli; and, (3) results which indicate that decreased approach motivation to positive stimuli may be a vulnerability factor to depression. Future research should be aimed to examine the relationship between parenting (e. g. <b>insecure</b> attachment; <b>inadequate</b> affect regulation), frontal lobe development (i. e., hemispheric asymmetry), cognitive vulnerability factors (e. g. uncertainty; rumination), and decreased approach motivation to positive stimuli...|$|R

In Indian cities many {{people live in}} marginal areas, with <b>insecure</b> housing, and <b>inadequate</b> provision of most public services, such as water and sanitation, electricity, garbage collection and policing. The research project will explore how "failures" in service delivery relate to interactions between individuals, their networks and state actors. Slumdwellers develop strategies to improve their lot, developed from learning from daily struggles, within a local social and political system shaped by unequal relations of power and status. The project will involve surveys of households in a few low income communities in greater Delhi, extensive interviews {{of the range of}} other actors involved (community leaders, politicians, fixers, local "big men", managers and frontline workers in state agencies) and archival work. It will initially involve in-depth work in four communities formed largely from past migrations from rural India. This is expected to be complemented by smaller surveys in several other communities in greater Delhi to place the in-depth work in broader context. The research will provide a deep analysis of the nature and formation of citizenship in marginal areas, and develop practical policy proposals for both state actors and civil society activists...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on a survey of {{households}} undertaken {{in the last quarter of}} 2001 for ILO as part of the project entitled People's Security Survey (PSS). The main objective of PSS was to try to capture people's perceptions and normative values of "livelihood" security. The PSS consists of a research framework developed by ILO focusing on poverty, labor market experience, and access to social protection policies and institutions of representation. The main instrument employed here was an extensive questionnaire originally administered on a sample of 1609 households from both urban and rural areas. For the purposes of the present work, we have removed the rural households in the sample to give the study a wholly urban focus. The present work is thus based on the findings of the survey of 1202 urban households. The towns in which the survey was undertaken were Addis Ababa, Debre Zeit, Mojo and Nazareth. The findings of the study reveal a population that is fearful and anxious about its basic subsistence, which is dependent on low and <b>insecure</b> income, <b>inadequate</b> social services, a shrinking labor market, and which is faced with gloomy prospects. It was evident that the great majority of households are weighed down by livelihood insecurity, with the threat of iv impoverishment and loss of means for basic sustenance hanging over them as a matter of course. The study reveals a great deal ofpessimism on the part of many: pessimism about one's basic security, about employment opportunities, and the chances for self-improvement. Most households are doubtful if there will be economic growth, or if the problem of poverty will be successfully tackled. Respondents were ashed to give their opinion about government programs to reduce poverty on the one hand, and to promote economic growth on the other. Obviously success in reducing poverty and boosting economic growth will have a positive impact on employment and business activity, and respondents were aware that the two issues are closely linked with their own livelihood. A good majority thought that the government's efforts on both counts were unsuccessful: the figures were 64 percent and 59 percent respectively. Only about 28 percent thought the programs were successful...|$|R

KEY MESSAGES ፚ Currently half of the global population lives in urban areas. ፚ A third live in urban slums. ፚ Slums are densely populated areas characterised by poor quality of housing, <b>insecure</b> tenure and <b>inadequate</b> access water, sanitation and electricity. ፚ Squatters are people who occupy vacant lands or unoccupied buildings without any legal right to the land/building. Squatter settlements refer to areas where people are squatting. ፚ Currently half of the world’s refugee population lives in urban areas: the number of IDPs who live in cities has similarly increased. ፚ IDPs and refugees who settle in slums face challenges accessing land and often become squatters. ፚ IDPs and refugees living in urban areas are as entitled to adequate housing as IDPs and refugees living in camps. ፚ Forced eviction (i. e. the removal of people from their homes or land against their will and without respecting rules such as prior consultation, prior notice and provision of alternative accommodation) is a violation of the human right to adequate housing. It is thus prohibited except when carried out in accordance with international human rights law. modul...|$|R
40|$|The British Army’s regular Mounted Infantry {{was arguably}} {{one of the}} most {{important}} innovations of the late Victorian and Edwardian armies. This thesis explores the regular Mounted Infantry model from its origins in extemporised infantry detachments overseas to its formal organisation as non-cavalry mounted troops before the First World War and juxtaposes its organisation and changing roles with its fractious relationship with the cavalry. Using four campaigns as case studies, the thesis provides a comparative assessment of the Mounted Infantry’s military effectiveness that culminated in it becoming the successful archetype for the British soldier in South Africa in the years 1901 - 02. The Mounted Infantry’s uniqueness compared to other nations’ armies is considered and the thesis identifies how other armies satisfied the requirement for mobile firepower. The Mounted Infantry was abolished in 1913 prior to the First World War. The reasons influencing this decision are analysed and indicate that the Mounted Infantry’s abolition owed more to politics than lack of military utility. The thesis concludes that rather than an impecunious alternative to an <b>inadequate</b> cavalry, the <b>Mounted</b> Infantry paradigm satisfied a particular need borne out of colonial campaigning...|$|R
40|$|As humans {{continue}} to modify natural habitats in Africa, particularly outside of protected areas, {{the survival of}} many chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations is dependant {{on their ability to}} adapt to human-dominated landscapes, and the willingness of local people to share their environment and resources with these large mammals. Unless hunted, chimpanzees may persist in anthropogenically-modified habitats including forest–farm mosaics, but competition and conflict can characterise their relationship with people. Conservation strategies are needed to facilitate successful coexistence. However, few studies have examined human–ape sympatry in detail. This thesis explores the ecological and behavioural adaptation of a previously unstudied chimpanzee community to an increasingly ‘agriculturalised’ landscape at Bulindi, Uganda. These chimpanzees live in exceptionally close proximity to farmers that exert unsustainable pressure on small unprotected forests. Research was conducted during 21 months between February 2006 and January 2008. Quantitative ecological methods were used to characterise the apes’ habitat and measure seasonal food availability. Indirect methods (e. g. faecal analysis and nest mapping) were employed to investigate chimpanzee diet and range use, supplemented by opportunistic behavioural observations. Riverine forests at Bulindi are rich in chimpanzee foods, but are rapidly being destroyed by people. Important foods in the apes’ diet include both wild and cultivated items; chimpanzees increased consumption of cultivars during the low forest fruiting season. Unique among studied populations in Uganda, Bulindi chimpanzees use tools to dig up subterranean bee nests for honey. Interviews were conducted to survey residents’ attitudes towards chimpanzees and forests. Chimpanzee behaviour is widely perceived by residents to have undergone recent negative changes, including increased crop-raiding and ranging into village areas, which correspond to major land-use changes (i. e. commercial logging and agricultural intensification). Further, adult males exhibit frequent human-directed aggression, apparently in response to harassment and intensifying competition with humans. Most residents fear chimpanzees. Because of poverty, <b>insecure</b> land tenure, <b>inadequate</b> law and policy enforcement, and corruption, local people currently have little incentive to maintain forest on their land. The study concludes that, under present conditions, chimpanzees will not survive at Bulindi or in similar unprotected forest–farm landscapes regionally without immediate, effective intervention. Recommendations for the conservation and management of chimpanzees in human-dominated landscapes are provided. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Childbirth holds {{short and}} {{long-term}} physical and psychological effects for women. Yet, numerous investigations into childbirth have overlooked the delicate interrelated psychological and emotional interplay that women experience, in favour of the physical, such as the outcomes of birth, maternal mortality, and the physical skills of healthcare providers. Although quantitative measures derived from these are important to establish and evaluate maternal health, they are not adequate to explain {{the complexity of the}} human experience of childbirth. Without this understanding there is inadequate guidance about how to proceed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targeting maternal health. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore childbirth experiences of women giving birth in Zambia, in order to better understand how they experience and give meaning to the phenomenon. The study was guided by an interpretive phenomenology approach. This type of phenomenology was found to be appropriate because the study sought to understand childbirth within the context of everyday lives of women birthing in Zambia. Purposive sampling was utilised to recruit 50 women aged between 16 and 38 years. The women had birthing experiences that occurred between 2005 and 2011. The birthing experiences were from all the ten provinces of Zambia. Data were collected through in-depth unstructured interviews, which were tape recorded. Data analysis was guided by van Manen’s six steps of analysis. Seven themes namely: 1) Conforming to societal norms, 2) Clash between traditional and contemporary childbirth practices, 3) Being in a dilemma, 4) Loss of dignity, 5) Feeling <b>insecure,</b> 6) <b>Inadequate</b> service provision, and 7) Being there for the woman, emerged from the analysis. Each theme had several sub-themes that provided a clearer picture of how participants experienced the phenomenon. The embodied experiences of participants illuminated the complex context of childbirth, whereby, the phenomenon was experienced in private, behind the closed door of secrecy that encompassed difficulties and issues such as, lack of choice, sub-standard care, discrimination, fear and conflicting information. The findings revealed that there was a need for an attitudinal change in maternity care professionals towards a more caring approach, as well as a parallel need to build agency and autonomy in women. For women, the change needs to be addressed at an individual and societal level, beginning with simple things, such as assertiveness training through to educational opportunities, so that they develop economic independence. Macro-reforms (top-down change) need to be combined with micro-reforms (bottom-up change) to challenge existing discriminatory, oppressive and patriarchal attitudes and practices that impact on women’s birth experiences. Women’s voices need to be heard. Understanding maternal outcomes at a micro level can help inform decisions and influence policy at the larger macro levels of institutions and government. Overlooking this intrinsic level represented an important barrier to utilisation of skilled birth care and constituted a common cause of suffering and human rights violations for birthing women. The key implications for practice pointed to a need for all maternity care stakeholders in Zambia to have an understanding of how women birthing in Zambia experience and give meaning to the childbirth phenomenon. This could start by re-examining current approaches to improving reproductive health, and addressing the contextual factors and community based issues that have been brought to light in this study. In the absence of such an understanding it is difficult to map out interventions that do not infringe on women’s beliefs and practices...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the occurrence of T-cell spontaneous apoptosis (A(spont)) and its modulation in vitro by the interleukin- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) gamma-chain (gammac) -signaling cytokine IL- 15 in patients transplanted with autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for hematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were examined on days 30 - 60, 60 - 90, and 90 - 120 after PBPC infusion. Dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, a hallmark of T-cell apoptosis, has been detected using the fluorescent probe 3, 3 '-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, after short-term T-cell culture in the absence or presence of exogenous cytokines. Expression of Bcl- 2 family members has been studied by flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. T-cell proliferative responses to recall antigens have been estimated in autologous mixed leukocyte cultures. RESULTS: A(spont) was seen in 45 % +/- 6 % of CD 4 (+) and 55 % +/- 6 % of CD 8 (+) T cells cultured in the absence of cytokines. Of interest, IL- 15 and, to a lesser extent, its structural cousin IL- 2 counteracted T-cell A(spont) by inhibiting the processing of caspase- 3 and up-regulating Bcl- 2 mRNA and protein levels. Cell division tracking confirmed that IL- 15 did not rescue T cells from A(spont) by promoting proliferation but rather acted as a genuine survival factor. Addition of a gammac-blocking antibody to cytokine-conditioned cultures abrogated both apoptosis inhibition and Bcl- 2 induction by IL- 15, suggesting involvement of the IL- 2 Rgammac signal transduction pathway. Whereas cytokine-unprimed posttransplant T cells <b>mounted</b> <b>inadequate</b> responses to recall antigens, T cells conditioned with IL- 15 expanded vigorously, indicating restoration of antigen-specific proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: T cells recovering after autologous PBPC transplantation are highly susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. This phenomenon can be counteracted by the gammac-signaling cytokine IL- 15. These findings suggest that IL- 15 might be a promising immunomodulating agent to improve postgrafting T-cell function...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that patterns of engagement and disengagement between {{the mother and}} her infant and child influence relational strengths and disturbances in adolescence and later life. This study investigated how adolescents perceive their parents and how their perceptions relate to Depression and symptoms of eating disorders. Participants {{were part of a}} longitudinal study of a school-based sample of adolescent development and depression at Pace University. Those included in this study completed the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Inventory of Parental Representations (IPR). ^ Multiple regression analysis determined whether adolescents with more negative parental representations experienced more depression and symptoms of eating disorders and whether adolescents who perceive their parents more positively were less depressed and less vulnerable to eating disorders. It was hypothesized that among females there would be an increase in the relationship between negative parental perceptions, depression, and eating disorder symptomatology compared to males. It was further hypothesized that a regression analyses would show a significant increase in negative paternal versus maternal perceptions as eating disorder symptomatology increases. ^ It was found that females reported having significantly higher levels of concern regarding dieting and a profound preoccupation with weight compared to males. Compared to the males, adolescent females reported having significantly higher levels of dissatisfaction with their bodies, a higher sense of alienation and a general reluctance to form close relationships. It was also found that females reported significantly more higher depression symptomatology than males. A strong relationship between depression and eating disorder subscales was suggested. It was found females who perceive their mothers as hostile compared to males, are more depressed. Also, the more females perceived their mothers as being passive and inept, when compared to males, the more depressed they would feel. The more females perceived their fathers as being passive and inept, when compared to males, the more depressed they would feel. Hence, the more females perceived their mothers as being possessive, when compared to males, the more difficulty they had identifying emotions and sensations, such as hunger. ^ The relationship between IPR negative Maternal Disappointed and EDI Ineffectiveness was stronger for females versus males the more females perceived their mothers as being demanding/disappointing, when compared to males, the more they <b>inadequate,</b> <b>insecure,</b> and worthlessness they feel. This study found that there was a statistically significant gender effect for mothers and fathers who were perceived to need Protection and Repair and EDI Bulimia and interoceptive awareness subscale. ^ Unanticipated was the finding that there were no statistically significant gender effects on the IPR negative (five) paternal subscales and EDI (eight) subscales. Interventions and applications with regard to school and clinical psychology are discussed with regard to gender, adolescent perceptions of parents, and psychopathology. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, many {{countries}} in Latin America and the Carib-bean that previously were plagued by high inflation, a large debt burden, and low growth have transformed themselves into stable, capital-receiv-ing, and growing economies. They achieved this by implementing high-quality policies that not only brought economic stability but also allowed {{the private sector to}} begin to be the principal source of growth. In effect, the private sector in the region has been unshackled, and it is this process that is outlined here. This study examines evidence from a number of recent reports of the private sector in Latin America and the Caribbean and finds that the economic transformation that has taken place is not a simple story but the product of complex interactions among macroeconomic stabilization, in-centive reforms, and institutional adaptation. No one element would have produced the results that have been achieved. For example, fiscal stability and better incentive structures give the correct signals for a shift of re-sources to more productive uses, but they do not address the barriers that hinder resource movement. Likewise, the traditional package of adjust-ment measures may be necessary to lay the foundation for rapid growth, but it is not sufficient to elicit a strong response from the private sector. Moreover, if the benefits of adjustment are perceived to be <b>inadequate,</b> public pressure <b>mounts</b> for reversal of both fiscally responsible policies and improved incentive structures. There is a “second generation” of issues that strongly influence development of the private sector. Among these are the need {{to reduce the amount of}} discretion in policy regimes; the burden of regulation on busi-nesses; the need for incentive reforms in new areas such as competition policy; the inability of the financial system to secure collateral; the cost of uncertainty of contracts under current legal systems; and issues related to the security of property rights. Specifically, a number of factors raise the risk and cost of business transactions and weaken the response to new incentives and macroeconomic reform. In addition to reviewing a number of recent studies of the private sector in Latin America, this study also reports on the results of interviews with officials of a large number of firms in five countries. It was written with the objective of making lessons from the work being done in the World Bank available to a wider audience, including policymakers, aca-demics, journalists, and all who are interested in developing countries in general and in Latin America and the Caribbean in particular. ...|$|R
