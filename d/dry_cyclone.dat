As common cyclone separators (<b>dry</b> <b>cyclone</b> separators) unable to collect fine particles efficiently, the liquid droplets are injected into cyclone chamber, to improve separation efficiently of cyclone separators. The major focus {{is the study of}} the effect of liquid droplet injection, on the collection of particles with diameter smaller than 10 microns. The problem of isothermal flow-field in cyclone separators is formulated in terms of the Eulerian partial differential equations of the gas phase conservation of mass and momentum An algebraic Reynolds stress model (ASM), is also used to involve turbulence efefcts. A Lagrangian approach is employed to predict the trajectories of discrete phase (particles and droplets) in cyclone chamber. The effect of velocity fluctuations on separation efficiency is studied by use of instantaneous fluctuating velocities instead of the mean velocities. The solid particles and liquid droplets are introduced in a converged flow solution. The injected droplets collect particles by use of one or more several collection mechanisms. In cyclone separators, Impaction is the principle collection mechanism. The detailed effects o...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{mesoscale}} numerical simulations {{were performed}} over Niger {{in order to}} investigate dry cyclogenesis in the West African intertropical discontinuity (ITD) during the summer, when it is located over the Sahel. The implications of dry cyclogenesis on dust emission and transport over West Africa are also addressed using the model results, together with spaceborne observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The study focuses {{on the case of}} 7 - 8 July 2006, during the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Special Observing Period 2 a 1. Model results show the formation of three dry cyclones in the ITD during a 24 -h period. Simulations are used to investigate the formation and the development of one of these cyclones over Niger in the lee of the Hoggar-Aïr Mountains. They show the development of the vortex to be associated with (1) strong horizontal shear and low-level convergence existing along the monsoon shearline and (2) enhanced northeasterly winds associated with orographic blocking of air masses from the Mediterranean Sea. The <b>dry</b> <b>cyclone</b> was apparent between 0700 and 1300 UTC in the simulation, and it was approximately 400 km wide and 1500 m deep. Potential vorticity in the center of vortex reached nearly 6 PVU {{at the end of the}} cyclogenesis period (1000 UTC). The role of the orography on cyclogenesis along the ITD was evaluated through model simulations without orography. The comparison of the characteristics of the vortex in the simulations with and without orography suggests that the orography plays a secondary but still important role in the formation of the cyclone. Orography and related flow splitting tend to create low-level jets in the lee of the Hoggar and Aïr mountains which, in turn, create conditions favorable for the onset of a better defined and more intense vortex in the ITD region. Moreover, orography blocking appears to favor the occurrence of a longer-lived cyclone. Furthermore, model results suggested that strong surface winds (∼ 11 m s− 1) enhanced by the intensification of the vortex led to the emission of dust mass fluxes as large as 3 μg m− 2 s− 1. The mobilized dust was mixed upward to a height of 4 - 5 km to be made available for long-range transport. This study suggests that the occurrence of dry vortices in the ITD region may contribute significantly to the total dust activity over West Africa during summer. The distribution of dust over the Sahara-Sahel may be affected over areas and at time scales much larger than those associated with the cyclone itself...|$|E

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{considerations}} that might cause lower efficiency in the dust collection system on boilers. One {{of the reasons is}} the deterioration of a dust collection system. Even properly designed systems from reputable suppliers may show a decrease in performance characteristics due to wear and poor maintenance. In principle, the dust collector is like any other equipment, requiring regular maintenance, servicing, evaluation and testing to ensure its operation is efficient and optimal. Poor awareness among the millers who only focus on maximizing mill productivity and who try to minimize the cost of production, instead of investing in high-efficiency pollution control system and good maintenance practice to protect the environment, is a major concern. The reason might be that there is no return or profit from the investment; it is merely a requirement of the Clean Air Regulation of 1978. Because of this, many mills simply use low-cost dust collectors just to fulfil the basic requirement of having a solid fuel boiler. Furthermore, improper design of dust collection systems, including poor quality control of material, can shorten the lifespan or increase the deterioration rate of a dust collection system, or it might even escalate the problem. For example, putting a wet scrubber instead of <b>dry</b> mechanical <b>cyclone</b> after a biomass boiler might create further problem since wastewater needs an extra wastewater treatment system to prevent water pollution problems.|$|R

The two global models generally capture the seasonal and regional {{variations of the}} ozone tendencies. The largest discrepancies between the ozone tendencies from the box model and those from the global models {{are found in the}} lower troposphere of the eastern North Atlantic during the ACSOE campaign and are attributed to differences between chemical schemes and too strong NOx concentrations in the global models.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fine {{particle}} processing {{has long}} been a challenge in the minerals processing industry. Ores often have to be ground to less than 100 μm in size in order to liberate the valuable components. Even in the coal industry, where there is minimal comminution, a considerable fraction of the run-of-mine coal is less than 100 μm in size. Hence, {{it can be difficult to}} efficiently recover these fine particles using existing beneficiation methods, such as flotation. In the past few decades, there has been on-going effort focussed on developing methods to separate finer particles in an efficient way, with an increasing interest in approaches that involve dry particles. This Thesis is concerned with the potential for achieving selective separations through contacting particles with water drops. More specifically, the objective was to achieve selective capture of the hydrophilic particles via the water phase, leaving the hydrophobic particles in a dry state. Two different approaches were investigated through the establishment of novel experimental systems. The first approach involved a system consisting of falling water drops passing through a gas-suspension of particles. Conceptually, this approach is the opposite of conventional flotation. A gaseous dispersion of particles was used instead of a water based dispersion of particles, and a system of falling water drops was used instead of a system of rising air bubbles. Thus the particles travelled horizontally with the airflow, colliding with drops via the gas side of the gas-liquid interface of the falling drops. The hydrophobic particles either adhered at the surface or were deflected, while the hydrophilic particles were engulfed completely, settling through to the base of the drop. Ideally the hydrophobic particles passed through the collection zone, reporting in a dry form. Thus, in the context of the coal industry, a high calorific dry product should be generated. Due to the low viscosity of air compared to water, the collision efficiency of the particles with the water drops should increase significantly compared to conventional flotation. Thus viscous forces become far less significant, allowing the inertial forces to dominate, even for ultrafine particles. Energy consumption should then be much lower. A new laboratory-scale experimental system was then designed and set up to further investigate this approach. The development of this facility represented a major outcome of the study, the goal being to control the steady flow of the particles and the drops to achieve reproducible and meaningful data sets. A number of design modifications were needed to achieve these requirements. The experimental system consisted of a feed column, water distribution chamber mounted over a collision chamber, underflow collection system, and <b>dry</b> particle <b>cyclone</b> stage. The airflow was driven by an air suction pump. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles covering a broad size range (8 - 116 μm) and spherical and irregular shapes were used in the experimental program to investigate the selective collection efficiency of this system. Results, expressed in terms of the recovery to underflow, were found to be highly reproducible, to within 3 %. A simple mathematical model was also developed to describe the interception of the particles with the water drops. Particles were assumed to be collected if there was any overlap in the trajectories of the particles and the drops. In one version, the particle velocity was assumed to be much higher than the falling speed of the drops, while in a second version the particle velocity was assumed to be much smaller than the drop speed. These models were then validated using the Discrete Element Method, demonstrating the accuracy of the model in these two extremes. Moreover, the DEM approach allowed intermediate, less extreme, conditions to be examined. Thus the modelling approach provided an appreciation of the principle parameters governing the interception, most notably the water flux, droplet diameter, and active length of the collection zone. Clearly, the model did not consider the subtle effects associated with the particle-drop adhesion, dynamic wetting, disengagement from the fluid streamlines, and particle shape effects. These more subtle effects were manifested through the experimental work. The recovery of the particles in the underflow was calculated relative to the total feed that passed through the experimental system. There was a linear dependence between the particle recovery in the underflow and the water flux, with a slope dependent on the relative selectivity between the different particle species. The analysis was examined using a water flux of up to 0. 0167 m 3 /(m 2 s). The results agreed well with the analytical and DEM models within the aforementioned water flux range. With the second approach, electrostatic formation of liquid marbles was investigated as an alternative mechanism for collecting hydrophilic glass ballotini particles into a water drop. In these experiments curious electrostatic phenomena were observed, resulting in the formation of particle agglomerates. Fine hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles on a charged substrate were seen to intermittently jump across a gap of several millimetres to penetrate the surface of a hanging water drop. The substrate was wrapped in Teflon (PTFE) tape, which provided an ideal substrate for frictional charging. Within around 300 milliseconds, the drop filled up like a 'sack of marbles'. Charge and volume data analysis of these experiments revealed that there is a tendency of the particles to jump to the drop intermittently in sudden 'cascades' or 'avalanches', rather than through gradual and incremental transfer as the substrate was moved toward the hanging drop. Although the distance between the substrate and the drop was important in affecting particle lift, the substrate speed had relatively little effect on the onset of the particle ‘avalanche’. This interesting phenomenon was also observed using different organic liquids such as glycerine and hexane. Overall, it was apparent that a limited selectivity between hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles can be achieved through direct interaction between a gaseous dispersion of the particles and a system of water drops. However, the level of selectivity was deemed to be insufficient for justifying the development of a successful industrial separation. The data sets generated from this work can be useful in any follow-up work in improving our understanding of the precise particle-drop interception, and final interaction. Electrostatic forces were clearly powerful across significant distances, and offered the potential for developing innovative methods for processing fine, dry particles. This approach may also prove useful in the formation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquid marbles...|$|R
