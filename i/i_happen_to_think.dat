500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E

I'm afraid I couldn't swear I was awake all the time; but I don't {{put it down}} to magic trees--only to a private hobby of going to bed at night. But look here, Mr. Paynter; there's another and better argument against any outsider from the village or countryside having committed the crime. Granted he might have slipped past us somehow, and gone for the Squire. But why should he go {{for him in the}} wood? How did he know he was in the wood? You remember how suddenly the poor old boy bolted into it, on what a momentary impulse. It's the last place where one would normally look for such a man, {{in the middle of the}} night. No, it's an ugly thing to say, but we, the group round that garden table, were the only people who knew.

"Just then <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of my oranges; so I asked mother {{if she was}} not thirsty, and {{she said}} she was a little thirsty, but she did not see how she could get any drink until the morning, for the houses were all shut up, and the people were in bed and asleep. So I told her that I had an orange for her and for father. She said she was very glad indeed.|$|R
60|$|I {{pondered the}} question. The blaze {{was a long}} way off, and I {{concluded}} I could risk camping on the spot, provided I did not make a fire. Accordingly I dismounted, and was searching for a suitable place when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the campfire might not be Dick's, after all.

5000|$|The Junie B. Jones series {{came in at}} #71 on the American Library Association's list of the Top 100 Banned or Challenged Books from 2000-2009. Reasons cited {{are poor}} social values taught by the books and Junie B. Jones not being {{considered}} {{a good role model}} due to her mouthiness and bad spelling and grammar. While Junie B. Jones writer Barbara Park appreciated being on banned lists with writers she respected (like Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison), she stopped reading information about her books because the comments were [...] "too hurtful". Park once wrote that some people [...] "believe that the value of a children's book can be measured only in terms of the moral lessons it tries to impose or the perfect role models it offers. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a book is of extraordinary value if it gives the reader nothing more than a smile or two.

5000|$|Frisbie started {{performing}} in the 1980s, {{when he was}} the owner of the Alley Cat Saloon in Champaign, Illinois, a focal point of the old live music scene at the University of Illinois campus. After selling his nightclub and returning to Chicago, he worked his way up the comedy ladder in clubs like Zanies and the original Chicago Improv. He is often compared to Rodney Dangerfield of which he has said, [...] "I hope they're talking about the energy, not physical appearance -- <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I look like Robert Redford." ...|$|E

"In {{the middle}} of the night <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> wake, then <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Rounders, then <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a story Baxter had told me, and then I burst out into a loud laugh. Fortunately Anita did not awake; she merely talked in her sleep, and turned over. The story Baxter had told me was this: In the past winter I had given a grand dinner, and Rounders was one of the guests. Isadore's {{specialty}} was ices, pastry, salads, and all sorts of delicate preparations, and he had excelled himself on this occasion, especially in the matter of sweets. At an unhappy moment Rounders had said to his neighbor that if she could taste the sort of thing she was eating as his cook made it she would know what it really ought to be. An obliging butler carried this remark to Monsieur Isadore as he was sipping his wine in his dressing-gown and slippers. The interesting part of this anecdote was Baxter's description of Isadore's rage. The furious cook took a cab and drove directly to Baxter's hotel. The wording of Monsieur Isadore's volcanic remarks I cannot state, but he butchered, cut up, roasted, carved, peppered, and salted Rounders's moral and social character in such a masterly way that Baxter laughed himself hoarse. The fiery cook would have left my service then and there if Baxter had not assured him that if the gilded reptile ever dined with him again Isadore should be informed beforehand, that he might have nothing to do with anything that went on the table. In consequence of this promise, Monsieur Isadore, having withdrawn a deposit of several thousand dollars from one of the trust companies with which Rounders was connected, consented to remain in my household.|$|R

I don't think that, even when the loss of you hurt most, I ever blamed you for going away. You had made me see myself as I was, and I knew that you had done the right thing.

You {{put it in a}} sentence that first day here, when you said that I had been kind--sometimes--when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it. That summed me up.

60|$|I fear {{it was not}} a very ardent flame, however, for Gus did {{not write}} every week, and I did not care a bit; nevertheless, I kept his picture and gave it a sentimental sigh when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, while he sent {{messages}} now and then, and devoted himself to his studies like an ambitious boy as he was. I hardly expected to see him again, but soon after the year was out, to my great surprise, he called. I was so fluttered by the appearance of his card that I rather lost my head, and did such a silly thing that it makes me laugh even now. He liked chestnut hair, and, pulling out my combs, I rushed down, theatrically dishevelled, hoping to impress my lover with my ardour and my charms.|$|R

50|$|Played by Kevin Nealon, he was {{originally}} an advertising executive (named Phil Maloney) who used subliminal messages to influence people. His appearances on Update utilized the subliminal technique (i.e. saying things rapidly and under his breath, in between sentences) to reveal {{what he is}} really thinking. For example, in an editorial on the 1994 caning of Michael Fay, he stated that:"...the boy admitted to spray painting cars but he's only eighteen and young people often do stupid and impulsive things they later regret (Shannen Doherty). <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> pause that everyone's entitled to one mistake (Euro Disney).

40|$|When {{the veteran}} ABC {{broadcaster}} Maxine McKew announced her pending retirement last week, the temptation {{was to see}} it as a reaction to the direction of the national broadcaster, particularly the new managing director Mark Scott, and the recently announced new editorial polices. McKew was quick to scotch both views. Scott, she said, was 'on the right track if anything,' she said. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she may be right, and this is despite the fact that elsewhere I have slammed Scott and the new editorial polices. So what is Scott doing right? The signs are he is giving due weight to the biggest challenge facing the ABC, and the main threat to its survival.

Her timid remoteness had its charm, and he fell to thinking, with amusement, how she who was so subordinate to him was, in the dimly known sphere {{in which he had}} been groping to find her, probably a person of authority and consequence. It satisfied a certain domineering quality in him to have reduced her to this humble attitude, while it increased the protecting tenderness he was beginning to have for her. His mind went off further upon this matter of one's different attitudes toward different persons; he thought of men, and women too, before whom he should instantly feel like a boy, if he could be confronted with them, even in his present lordliness of mood. In a fashion of his when he convicted himself of anything, he laughed aloud. Lydia shrank a little from him, in question. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] he said.
