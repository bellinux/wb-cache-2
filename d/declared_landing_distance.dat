40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{multidisciplinary}} optimization of a generic two dimensional three element high-lift configuration. The objective of this work is to conduct a proof-of concept optimization and to find an optimized high-lift system with a feasible flap mechanism and enhanced aerodynamic performance which is reflected in a decreased take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> During the multidisciplinary optimization following disciplines are analyzed: Kinematics, Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics. The proof-of-concept optimization is performed successfully and reveals a configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, reduced take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> while the kinematic and aerodynamic constraints are satisfied. The overall take-off distance is reduced due to the augmentation of the maximum lift coefficient for the take-off configuration {{which leads to a}} significant shorter ground roll <b>distance.</b> At <b>landing</b> the moderate reduction in the overall <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> is related to the enhanced maximum lift coefficient, which lowers the approach and touch-down speed. According to the data sets of the optimization it seems that the take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> that form the objective function are not in conflict in this scenario. The optimization results indicate that the aerodynamic performance is more sensitive to parameters that define the slat setting and the magnitude of the flap deployment than to parameters that define the geometry of the flap mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the phases}} of flight {{operations}} pilots feel much pressure in landing segment. There {{is a number}} of factors affecting landing safety while pilots reduce aircraft speeds and make a touchdown and stop completely. If runway length is sufficient for landing, there maybe is no problem. But it is not the case all the time. So it is necessary to confirm whether landing performance is within limits or not. Required <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> is actual <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> demonstrated by flight test pilot plus allowances for average airline pilots. FAR(Federal Aviation Regulations) AFM certification is based upon manual landing for dry and wet runway. Other runway conditions are not the certification basis. JAR dictates even contaminated/slippery runway is included by prescribed allowances. Automatic landing is not certification basis, so actual <b>landing</b> <b>distances</b> are provided. In this paper I would like to analyze distance allowances included in each type of runway condition. In addition there is no regulation about allowances for specific runway condition, I would suggest adequat...|$|R
40|$|Landing {{excursion}} accidents {{have become}} a major concern over recent decades regarding airline and airport safety. Available runway friction has {{a significant impact on}} aircraft landing performance. This is especially noted when aircraft are landing on wet or otherwise contaminated runways due to the reduced braking action, which has been well documented since the dawn of the jet aircraft age. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool to help make recommendations for airports that are subjected to diverse weather conditions. In order to model an aircraft’s real landing performance, a mechanistic-empirical aircraft deceleration equation was developed. This equation contains all of the major forces that contribute to aircraft braking, and is calibrated and validated using digital flight data from dry runway aircraft landings. Digital flight data from a Boeing 737 - 700, runway pavement condition monitoring data, and weather data was collected. Finally, a Boeing 737 - 700 case study was conducted. As a result, it is able to back calculate the braking friction coefficient from the developed equation and evaluate the impact of wet and contaminated runways on aircraft braking performance. A study of a Boeing 737 - 700 aircraft landing performance on runways under different conditions was conducted. A mechanistic-empirical <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> model is established based on the mechanistic-empirical deceleration equation, in order to accurately calculate the required <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> When developing the <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> model, the following characteristics are considered: pilot settings (TLA, spoiler position, and flap position configurations), aircraft operational characteristics (touchdown speed and weight), the runway friction condition, and aircraft braking system characteristics. A Boeing 737 - 700 real data case study was conducted and a comparison was made with the Boeing 737 Quick Reference Handbook reference <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> The results indicate the model offers an accurate prediction of aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> Finally, future applications of this thesis are introduced. The potential of the development of a runway assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework was proposed. Opportunities of applying this thesis in on-board <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> calculation, quick exit taxiway design and airport operation optimization, and fuel consumption reduction were presented. Moreover, the development of the Braking Availability Tester was discussed...|$|R
