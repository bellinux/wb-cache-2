5|$|A {{large number}} of <b>genera</b> of macroinvertebrates have been {{discovered}} in and around Nescopeck Creek. These consist of one genus of segmented worm, one genus of sowbugs, 11 <b>genera</b> of mayflies, 8 <b>genera</b> of stone flies, 11 <b>genera</b> of caddisflies, 6 <b>genera</b> of dragonflies, 2 <b>genera</b> of helgrammites, 10 <b>genera</b> of beetles, and one genus of fly.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics often vary by habitat, between shade-dwelling <b>genera</b> (such as Prosartes, Tricyrtis, Cardiocrinum, Clintonia, Medeola, Prosartes, and Scoliopus) and sun loving <b>genera.</b> Shade-dwelling <b>genera</b> {{usually have}} broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation, and fleshy fruits (berries) with animal-dispersed seeds, rhizomes, and small, {{inconspicuous}} flowers while <b>genera</b> native to sunny habitats usually have narrow, parallel-veined leaves, capsular fruits with wind-dispersed seeds, bulbs, and large, visually conspicuous flowers. (See also Evolution).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 57 <b>genera</b> of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, {{as many of the}} <b>genera</b> have not been the subject of recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. <b>Genera</b> from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|Arixeniina {{represents}} two <b>genera,</b> Arixenia and Xeniaria, with a {{total of}} five species in them. As with Hemimerina, they are blind and wingless, with filiform segmented cerci. Hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites, preferring the fur of African rodents in either Cricetomys or Beamys <b>genera.</b> Hemimerina also has two <b>genera,</b> Hemimerus and Araeomerus, {{with a total}} of 11 species.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur <b>genera</b> have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} <b>genera</b> preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur <b>genera</b> existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|During the Cretaceous period, a few {{species of}} {{primitive}} ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce {{in comparison to}} the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation {{at the beginning of the}} Paleogene period. By the Oligocene and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20â€“40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 <b>genera</b> survive to the present. <b>Genera</b> surviving today comprise 56% of the <b>genera</b> in Baltic amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the <b>genera</b> in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).|$|E

5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species as separate <b>genera,</b> as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related <b>genera</b> such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen <b>genera</b> to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six <b>genera</b> being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's <b>genera</b> into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the <b>genera</b> with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Rogerson {{presented}} a detailed {{history of the}} Hypocreales and reviewed changes in the circumscription of the order up to that time. His publication included keys to the <b>genera</b> of both the Hypocreales and Clavicipitales, followed by a list of <b>genera,</b> each with the literature citation of the original descriptions and type species. He included 115 <b>genera</b> in the Hypocreales.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{advances}} in DNA analysis allowed {{a more detailed}} study of the fisher's evolutionary history. It was determined that the fisher and the Martes <b>genera</b> were descended from a common ancestor but the fisher was distinct enough {{to put it in}} its own <b>genera.</b> It was decided to create the Pekania <b>genera</b> and reclassify the fisher as Pekania pennanti.|$|E
5|$|In its taxonomic history, Harrya chromapes {{has been}} shuffled to several {{different}} <b>genera,</b> including Boletus, Leccinum, and Tylopilus, {{and is known}} in field guides {{as a member of}} one of these <b>genera.</b> In 2012, it was transferred to the newly created genus Harrya when it was established that morphological and molecular evidence demonstrated its distinctness from the <b>genera</b> in which it had formerly been placed.|$|E
5|$|In volume 1 of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus (1758) {{described}} seventeen {{species of}} ants, {{all of which}} he placed in the single genus Formica. Within a few decades additional <b>genera</b> had been recognized, and this trend continued in the ensuing years, together {{with the development of}} a more complex hierarchical classification in which <b>genera</b> were apportioned among subfamilies and tribes. The ant species described by Linnaeus are now dispersed in eleven different <b>genera,</b> belonging to four subfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} of nuclear DNA supports {{a close relationship}} between Eliurus, Voalavo, and two other nesomyine <b>genera,</b> Gymnuromys and Brachytarsomys. These <b>genera</b> are more distantly related to the other nesomyine <b>genera</b> and even more distantly to the other subfamilies of the family Nesomyidae, which occur in mainland Africa.|$|E
5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several <b>genera</b> of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' {{at the tip}} of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two <b>genera</b> of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|E
5|$|Numerous macroinvertebrate {{species have}} been {{observed}} in Spring Brook. A total of 18 <b>genera</b> are from the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. A short distance upstream of the Watres Reservoir, the most common <b>genera</b> taxa were the family Chironomidae and the <b>genera</b> Drunella, Ephemerella, and Hydropsyche. Of a 200-individual sample, 34, 28, 25, and 20 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Slightly less common are the <b>genera</b> Epeorus, Hexatoma, Leuctra, and Lepidostoma. Of the 200-individual sample, 15, 13, 11, and 10 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Still less common are the <b>genera</b> Baetis, Paraleptophlebia, Acroneuria, Stenonema, Nigronia, Agapetus, DoIophilodes, and Optioservus. In the 200-individual sample, 8, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, and 2 individuals of each taxon have been observed, respectively. Only one individual each of the <b>genera</b> Isonychia, Amphinemura, Cheumatopsyche, Rhycophila, Neophylax, Psephenus, Boyeria, Tabanus, and Cambarus were observed.|$|E
5|$|Numerous macroinvertebrate {{species have}} been {{observed}} in Stafford Meadow Brook, including 18 taxa in the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. In a 210-individual sample, the most common taxa were the genus Hydropsyche (62 individuals), the family Chironomidae (27 individuals), and the <b>genera</b> Amphinemura (23 individuals), Lectura (14 individuals), Hexatoma (11 individuals), and Lanthus (10 individuals). Less common were the <b>genera</b> Baetis and Ephemerella (9 individuals each), Acroneuria (6 individuals), Cheumatopsyche and Rhyacophila (4 individuals each), and Simulium (3 individuals). There were four <b>genera</b> with two individuals each and 13 <b>genera</b> and one order with one individual each.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant <b>genera</b> {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small <b>genera,</b> while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous <b>genera.</b> Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many <b>genera.</b> Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small <b>genera</b> were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger <b>genera,</b> such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster <b>genera</b> such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
5|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the mushroom-forming <b>genera</b> (marked with * below) can be less obvious or absent in tropical species. Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both <b>genera</b> {{have yet to be}} identified. Most field guides treat the two <b>genera</b> together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|The Thamnophilidae {{contains}} {{several large}} or very large <b>genera</b> and numerous small or monotypic ones. Several, which {{are difficult to}} assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds. The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in Myrmotherula and Myrmeciza, need to be assigned to other <b>genera.</b> Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such {{a large number of}} often poorly known species, the assignment of some <b>genera</b> is still awaiting confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series) in the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed {{the retention of}} large <b>genera</b> that would otherwise have become unwieldy. E. J. H. Corner believed that studying large <b>genera</b> might enable greater insights into evolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical <b>genera</b> such as Ficus.|$|E
5|$|The largest <b>genera</b> are Gagea (200), Fritillaria (130), Lilium (110), and Tulipa (75 species), {{all within}} the Lilieae tribe. Various {{authorities}} (e.g. ITIS 16, GRIN 27, WCSP, NCBI, DELTA) differ {{on the exact}} number of <b>genera</b> included in Liliaceae s.s., but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen <b>genera,</b> depending on whether or not Amana is included in Tulipa and Lloydia in Gagea. For instance Amana is still listed separately in WCSP.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of dinosaurs}} is a {{comprehensive}} listing of all <b>genera</b> that have ever {{been included in the}} superorder Dinosauria, excluding class Aves (birds, both living and those known only from fossils) and purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted <b>genera,</b> but also <b>genera</b> that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomen dubium), or were not formally published (nomen nudum), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and <b>genera</b> that are no longer considered dinosaurs. Many listed names have been reclassified as everything from birds to crocodilians to petrified wood. The list contains 1513 names, of which approximately 1190 are considered either valid dinosaur <b>genera</b> or nomina dubia.|$|E
5|$|Tribe Cacatuini: Four <b>genera</b> of white, {{pink and}} grey species.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauridae is uncontroversially {{divided into}} two subfamilies. Albertosaurinae {{comprises}} the North American <b>genera</b> Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus, while Tyrannosaurinae includes Daspletosaurus, Teratophoneus, Bistahieversor, Tarbosaurus, Nanuqsaurus, Zhuchengtyrannus, and Tyrannosaurus itself. Some authors include the species Gorgosaurus libratus in the genus Albertosaurus and Tarbosaurus bataar in the genus Tyrannosaurus, while others prefer to retain Gorgosaurus and Tarbosaurus as separate <b>genera.</b> Albertosaurines are characterized by more slender builds, lower skulls, and proportionately longer tibiae than tyrannosaurines. In tyrannosaurines, the sagittal crest on the parietals continues forward onto the frontals. Some authors, such as George Olshevsky and Tracy Ford, have created finer subdivisions or tribes for various combinations of tyrannosaurs within the subfamilies. However, these have not been phylogenetically defined, and usually consisted of <b>genera</b> that are now considered synonymous with other <b>genera</b> or species.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia {{has been}} found to be closely related to the <b>genera</b> Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, {{together}} forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these <b>genera</b> are contested. Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both <b>genera</b> forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at al.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 <b>genera)</b> are endemic. The few families and <b>genera</b> of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E
5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary <b>genera,</b> {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the <b>genera</b> Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, {{including}} {{some members of}} the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) <b>genera,</b> but not enterococci.|$|E
5|$|Aiphanes {{is placed}} in the {{subfamily}} Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with the <b>genera</b> Desmoncus, Bactris, Acrocomia and Astrocaryum.|$|E
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both <b>genera</b> had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized dentition and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both <b>genera</b> also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|As a group, the Sclerodermatineae {{have a broad}} distribution, {{and some}} <b>genera</b> (Pisolithus and Scleroderma) have been found on all continents except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen <b>genera</b> today, and attempts were made to separate it into different <b>genera.</b> This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other <b>genera,</b> several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five <b>genera</b> based on differences in the male flowers. Since the <b>genera</b> can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different <b>genera</b> has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur <b>genera</b> to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early <b>genera</b> of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
5|$|Biochrons for aetosaur <b>genera</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for dating strata in the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States. Up to 13 <b>genera</b> of aetosaurs are known from the Chinle Group, with most occurring in multiple localities and over short time spans. In 1996, paleontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Andrew B. Heckert recognized five biochrons based on the presence of aetosaurs throughout the Chinle Group. The number of biochrons grew to 11 in a 2007 study by Heckert and Lucas along with Adrian P. Hunt and Justin A. Spielmann. These biochrons occurred from the Otischalkian LVF to the Apachean LVF and included <b>genera</b> such as Longosuchus, Tecovasuchus, and Typothorax.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 <b>genera</b> and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 <b>genera.</b> The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
