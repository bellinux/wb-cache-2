5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks may <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> home ranges, and, {{since the}} males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{election}} Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.|$|E
5|$|A Bronze Age {{cemetery}} and {{the remains of}} an Iron Age settlement have been discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E

5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E
5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence {{as well as a}} perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> the possibility of a second film.|$|E

5|$|Dust and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale {{for all of the}} dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> the disk in its current state over its estimated age.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E

5|$|Shelley wrote eleven poems for Jane {{during that}} time. She {{served as the}} primary {{inspiration}} for the last poems that he wrote before his death. This did not bother Edward; he was proud that his wife inspired such poetry. Some biographers of Shelley <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> that Shelley's feelings for Jane were strictly platonic, although different scholars have observed themes of frustrated sexual desires in Shelley's poetry during this period. Other critics have noted that Shelley's poems during this period struggle to define his feelings.|$|E
5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to <b>have</b> <b>maintained</b> a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E
