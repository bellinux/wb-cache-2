Aidoo returned in mid-October and played in a 72–0 blowout against the Toronto Varsity Blues, but he received only three carries. He also played on special teams.

Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones on the advice of club doctors, who later discovered the severity of the <b>injury.</b> Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the <b>injury,</b> he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E

5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the <b>injury</b> fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the <b>injury</b> report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an <b>injury,</b> the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the <b>injury</b> on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the <b>injury.</b> Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Floating knee <b>injuries</b> {{are usually}} {{associated}} with other significant <b>injuries.</b> Do these <b>injuries</b> have implications on {{the management of the}} floating knee and the final outcome of patients? Our study aims to assess the implications of associated <b>injuries</b> in the management and final outcome of floating knee. Methods 29 patients with floating knees were assessed in our institution. A retrospective analysis of medical records and radiographs were done and all associated <b>injuries</b> were identified. The impact of associated <b>injuries</b> on delay in initial surgical management, delay in rehabilitation & final outcome of the floating knee were assessed. Results 38 associated <b>injuries</b> were noted. 7 were associated with ipsilateral knee <b>injuries.</b> Lower limb <b>injuries</b> were most commonly associated with the floating knee. Patients with some associated <b>injuries</b> had a delay in surgical management and others a delay in post-operative rehabilitation. Knee ligament and vascular <b>injuries</b> were associated with poor outcome. Conclusion The associated <b>injuries</b> were quite frequent with the floating knee. Some of the associated <b>injuries</b> caused a delay in surgical management and post-operative rehabilitation. In assessment of the final outcome, patients with associated knee and vascular <b>injuries</b> had a poor prognosis. Majority of the patients with associated <b>injuries</b> had a good or excellent outcome. </p...|$|R
5|$|Another <b>injury</b> problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} <b>injury</b> sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season.

However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, an <b>injury</b> to Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates {{there was one}} minute remaining. The <b>injury</b> itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds of <b>injury</b> time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of <b>injury</b> time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{overview}} of the incidence and (volleyball-specific) risk factors of musculoskeletal <b>injuries</b> among volleyball players, nor any insight into the effect of preventive measures on the incidence of <b>injuries</b> in volleyball. This study aimed to review systematically the scientific evidence on the incidence, prevalence, aetiology and preventive measures of volleyball <b>injuries.</b> To this end, a highly sensitive search strategy was built based on two groups of keywords (and their synonyms). Two electronic databases were searched, namely Medline (biomedical literature) via Pubmed, and SPORTDiscus (sports and sports medicine literature) via EBSCOhost. The results showed that ankle, knee and shoulder <b>injuries</b> {{are the most common}} <b>injuries</b> sustained while playing volleyball. Results are presented separately for acute and overuse <b>injuries,</b> as well as for contact and non-contact <b>injuries.</b> Measures to prevent musculoskeletal <b>injuries,</b> anterior knee <b>injuries</b> and ankle <b>injuries</b> were identified in the scientific literature.

Our systematic review showed that musculoskeletal <b>injuries</b> are common among volleyball players, while effective preventive measures remain scarce. Further epidemiological studies should focus on other specific <b>injuries</b> besides knee and ankle <b>injuries,</b> and should also report their prevalence and not only the incidence.

5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain <b>injury,</b> for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, <b>injury</b> to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of <b>injury,</b> the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup <b>injury.</b> Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of <b>injury,</b> a variety of events in the minutes to days following the <b>injury</b> may result in secondary <b>injury.</b> These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
