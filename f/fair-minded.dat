5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that <b>fair-minded</b> jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no <b>fair-minded</b> man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because <b>fair-minded</b> jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E

The goal was not to prove the holocaust, but to show that any reasonable and <b>fair-minded</b> historian would not doubt it, and that Irving must therefore not be reasonable or <b>fair-minded.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} Bao looked after his parents at home, Liu Yun (刘赟), Magistrate of Luzhou who was renowned as an {{excellent}} poetic and <b>fair-minded</b> officer, usually visited Bao. Because the two got along well, Bao obtained great influence from Liu Yun {{in respect of}} the love for people.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reasonable}} suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and <b>fair-minded</b> person sitting {{in court and}} knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.|$|E
25|$|In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), {{counsel for}} the {{applicants}} alleged that the judge was guilty of actual bias and requested that she recuse herself. The judge rejected the application as she found the supporting grounds flimsy, and felt that a <b>fair-minded</b> and reasonable observer would hardly conclude {{that she would not}} be able to make an objective and impartial decision of the matters placed before her as another judge would.|$|E
25|$|The SCJA {{does not}} contain any {{provisions}} {{similar to the ones}} referred to above that apply to Supreme Court judges. Nonetheless, at common law a judge can be disqualified from hearing or deciding a case {{if he or she is}} actually biased against a party, or appears to biased. The test for apparent bias is whether a reasonable and <b>fair-minded</b> person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken by {{scholars}} {{that there is no}} practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985) that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion of bias on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood of bias on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility of bias and this is not very different from establishing that a <b>fair-minded</b> member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant was not possible.|$|E

McBride suggested that the character represents the great Partisan leaders who led thousands in Italy throughout World War II: [...] "He's a deeply thoughtful young man. After witnessing several atrocities, he basically snaps and becomes {{one of the most}} ruthless and most clever and most sought-after Partisans. Although he's ruthless against his enemies, he's always a <b>fair-minded</b> person, deeply kind, fighting for his country—not fighting to kill Germans, fighting to kill the enemy. He's a leader with a heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars are, however, {{careful to}} note that except for Benjamin Franklin's works and Joel Barlow's pamphlets, Johnson did not print {{anything}} truly revolutionary. He refused to publish Paine's Rights of Man and William Blake's The French Revolution, for example. It {{is almost impossible to}} determine Johnson's own personal political beliefs from the historical record. Marilyn Gaull argues that [...] "if Johnson were radical, indeed if he had any political affiliation ... it was accidental". Gaull describes Johnson's [...] "liberalism" [...] as that [...] "of [...] generous, open, <b>fair-minded,</b> unbiased defender of causes lost and won". His real contribution, she contends, was [...] "as a disseminator of contemporary knowledge, especially science, medicine, and pedagogical practice" [...] and as an advocate for a popular style. He encouraged all of his writers to use [...] "plain syntax and colloquial diction" [...] so that [...] "self-educated readers" [...] could understand his publications. Johnson's association with writers such as Godwin has previously been used to emphasize his radicalism, but Braithwaite points out that Godwin only became a part of Johnson's Circle late in the 1790s; Johnson's closest friends—Priestley, Fuseli, and Bonnycastle—were much more politically moderate. Johnson was not a populist or democratic bookseller: he catered to the self-educating middle class.|$|E
500|$|Morris' biographer E.P. Thompson {{described}} him as having a [...] "robust bearing, and a slight roll in his walk", alongside a [...] "rough beard" [...] and [...] "disordered hair". The author Henry James described Morris as [...] "short, burly, corpulent, very careless and unfinished in his dress... He has a loud voice and a nervous restless manner and a perfectly unaffected and businesslike address. His talk indeed is wonderfully to the point and remarkable for clear good sense." [...] Morris' first biographer Mackail {{described him}} as being both [...] "a typical Englishman" [...] and [...] "a typical Londoner of the middle class" [...] albeit one who was transformed into [...] "something quite individual" [...] through the [...] "force of his genius". MacCarthy described Morris' lifestyle as being [...] "late Victorian, mildly bohemian, but bourgeois", with Mackail commenting that he exhibited many of the traits of the bourgeois Victorian class: [...] "industrious, honest, <b>fair-minded</b> up their lights, but unexpansive and unsympathetic". Although he generally disliked children, Morris also exhibited {{a strong sense of}} responsibility toward his family. Mackail nevertheless thought he [...] "was interested in things much more than in people" [...] and that while he did have [...] "lasting friendships" [...] and [...] "deep affections", he did not allow people to [...] "penetrate to the central part of him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The key to {{understanding}} Smith," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian {{view of the world}} both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." [...] Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be [...] "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with [...] "tak on the mantle of historic Britain" [...] in the imperial power's absence. [...] "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," [...] Boynton reflected, [...] "and how this small community of decent, <b>fair-minded</b> whites had been betrayed by, well, just about everybody he could think of... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered [...] "unfair and inaccurate": [...] "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication." ...|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a <b>fair-minded</b> and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|In Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992), the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} when {{determining}} whether apparent bias exists, a [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] test should be applied, that is, [...] "would a reasonable and <b>fair-minded</b> person sitting {{in court and}} knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible"? The reasonable suspicion test originated in Australia, where it {{is known as the}} [...] "reasonable apprehension" [...] test. The current position in Australia may be best summed up thus: [...] " [...] judge is disqualified if a <b>fair-minded</b> lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide". This is essentially the same position in Singapore, as Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997), which applied the Australian cases Bainton v. Rajski (1992) and Re JRL, ex parte CJL (1986), indicates.|$|E

[...] Their {{personal}} stories and their love for our homeland will continue to inspire me as I look ahead and consider future opportunities for public service. [...] I remain steadfast in the desire to serve both my country and the State of Texas to help bring new, responsible, and <b>fair-minded</b> leadership to our government.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Menon {{argued that}} the real {{likelihood}} test requires there be a sufficient degree of bias, but this is [...] "utterly imprecise" [...] and [...] "inherently, indeed impossibly, subjective". In contrast, the reasonable suspicion test avoids this problem as it directs the court's mind not towards the degree of possibility of bias but towards the suspicions the court thinks a <b>fair-minded</b> member of the public could reasonably entertain on the facts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} {{personality}} {{is based on}} the essential insight that all people are similar in some ways, yet different in others. [...] There have been many different definitions of personality proposed. However, many contemporary psychologists agree on the following defias differentiating the HEXACO model from other personality frameworks. Specifically, the H factor is described as sincere, honest, faithful/loyal, modest/unassuming, <b>fair-minded,</b> VERSUS sly, deceitful, greedy, pretentious, hypocritical, boastful, and pompous. The H factor has been linked to criminal, materialistic, power-seeking, and unethical tendencies.|$|E
2500|$|His {{opponents have}} {{attacked}} Hayek {{as a leading}} promoter of neoliberalism. A British journalist, Samuel Brittan, concluded in 2010, [...] "Hayek's book [...] is still probably the most comprehensive statement of the underlying ideas of the moderate free market philosophy espoused by neoliberals." [...] Brittan adds that although Raymond Plant (2009) comes {{out in the end}} against Hayek's doctrines, Plant gives The Constitution of Liberty a [...] "more thorough and <b>fair-minded</b> analysis than it has received even from its professed adherents".|$|E
2500|$|The {{allegations}} of actual bias in Chee Sok Chin were {{deemed to be}} [...] "entirely frivolous and ludicrous", in that [...] "a <b>fair-minded</b> and reasonable observer would hardly on those flimsy grounds" [...] conclude that Justice Ang [...] "would {{not be able to}} make an objective and impartial decision of the matters" [...] before her as another impartial judge would. Citing Tang Liang Hong v. Lee Kuan Yew (1997), an apparent bias case, the judge said that claims of actual bias need to be based on facts which are [...] "substantially true and accurate".|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in Porter v. Magill (2001), the House of Lords reconsidered {{its earlier}} {{decision}} in Gough {{in the light}} of Locabail and Re Medicaments. It approved the two-stage test established in Locabail as modified by Re Medicaments, holding that there is apparent bias when [...] "the <b>fair-minded</b> and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased". It omitted from the test the reference to [...] "real danger" [...] as it was not mentioned in European Court of Human Rights cases and [...] "no longer serve a useful purpose here".|$|E

I would ask any <b>fair-minded</b> mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) – from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book! ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the federal {{government}} established land grant legislation to provide funding for higher education across the United States.

Some states classified their black state colleges as land grant institutions. Former Congressman John Roy Lynch wrote, [...] "there are very many liberal, <b>fair-minded</b> and influential Democrats in the State [...] who are strongly in favor of having the State provide for the liberal education of both races." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Director of New England Conservatory. Known in the Boston arts circle as talented, personable, and energetic, he was crucial in transforming NEC into a respectable school of music. Chadwick implemented features that resembled {{those of the}} German conservatories of his experience. He established a variety of performing ensembles, and students were required to take more music theory and history classes. He also invited members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra as private teachers to the students, along with being an inspiring teacher himself. His students described him as [...] "demanding, though <b>fair-minded</b> and witty". Among his pupils were Horatio Parker, William Grant Still, Arthur Whiting, Wallace Goodrich, Frederick S. Converse, Florence Price, and Henry Hadley.|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{returned}} to the NLRB in 1963. He was appointed Associate Executive Secretary, and served in that role until 1968. He was promoted to Deputy Executive Secretary and served in that capacity until 1972. Truesdale had a positive opinion of Edward B. Miller, the Nixon-appointed chair of the NLRB chair from 1970 to 1974. [...] "He {{did not come to}} the board to execute a management agenda," [...] Truesdale said in 2006. [...] "He was a very <b>fair-minded</b> person; he worked well with his colleagues." [...] He received his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1972.

2500|$|After {{concluding}} {{that there were}} in fact {{differences between the two}} tests, Judicial Commissioner Menon went on to consider which was the applicable test in Singapore. He held that the reasonable suspicion test was preferable to the real likelihood test, and so chose to follow the line of Singapore cases before Shankar that endorsed the use of the reasonable suspicion test. The Court of Appeal had established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992) that the applicable test in Singapore for apparent bias was the reasonable suspicion test. The judges held that the question to be asked under the test was: [...] "Would a reasonable and <b>fair-minded</b> person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the applicant was not possible?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Menon {{added that}} the real {{likelihood}} test poses an [...] "inherent difficulty" [...] because it is [...] "utterly imprecise". This is because the standard of proof, being a question with respect to [...] "possibility", is lower than that on a balance of probabilities which requires the court to be satisfied that [...] "more likely than not" [...] there was bias. Although in Gough Lord Goff of Chieveley stated that the test is satisfied {{if there is a}} sufficient degree of possibility of bias, what is [...] "sufficient" [...] is often subjective. The reasonable suspicion test, however, avoids this problem because the court is not inquiring into the degree of possibility of bias but toward the impression which a <b>fair-minded</b> member of the public could reasonably form on the facts presented.|$|E
2500|$|Menon {{found that}} the {{resolution}} of the complaint did not hinge on the risk of any impressions made on a <b>fair-minded</b> observer, but on the risk that by descending into the arena the judge may have impaired his or her ability to evaluate and weigh the arguments from both parties, thus causing the trial to be unfair. The judicial function entails judges asking whatever questions are necessary to ensure a thorough understanding of the facts and arguments in order to arrive at a just conclusion. Throughout this process, they must maintain judicial calm and detachment, without assuming the role of counsel. A judge could not take actions [...] "aimed at securing evidence to justify a finding of guilt"; to do so would be to adopt an inquisitorial role, which was at odds with the adversarial process favoured by the common law.|$|E
2500|$|The judge deems that [...] "in {{the course}} of his {{prolonged}} cross-examination, Evans justified {{each and every one of}} the criticisms on which the Defendants have chosen to rely." [...] On the issue of Auschwitz, the judge states [...] "My conclusion is that the various categories of evidence do 'converge' in the manner suggested by the Defendants... Having considered the various arguments advanced by Irving to assail the effect of the convergent evidence relied upon by the Defendants, it is my conclusion that no objective, <b>fair-minded</b> historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews," [...] and [...] "it follows that it is my conclusion that Irving's denials of these propositions were contrary to the evidence." [...] Furthermore, [...] "the allegation that Irving is a racist is also established." ...|$|E

[...] In a tribute published in The Straits Times on 27 July 2010, Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security S. Jayakumar said that Tiwari [...] "was much respected, not just by {{his colleagues in the}} Singapore public service, but in Asean and internationally.

Stagg objected when Reese endorsed, with Smallenberger in agreement, a slate of candidates for party position on {{both the state and}} parish committees. Stagg, backed by Beaird, the then chairman of the Caddo Parish Republican Executive Committee, described Reese as having attempted to assemble a group of [...] "yes-men" [...] and had hence [...] "earned the enmity {{of a large number of}} <b>fair-minded</b> Republicans".

[...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is {{but it seems to me}} that it invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Reese, as the Louisiana Republican {{national}} committeeman, and LeRoy Smallenberger, {{an attorney}} in Shreveport who was elected the state party chairman in 1960, became involved in an intra-party feud with Tom Stagg, another Shreveport lawyer and subsequent judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, and Charles T.

2500|$|Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of {{forensic}} evidence were {{given for the}} jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives [...] "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is [...] "the hardest, most elusive" [...] instruction of all. [...] "And I think it's where even the most <b>fair-minded</b> jurors can get derailed", she said, opining the confusion between reasonable doubt and a reason to doubt.
