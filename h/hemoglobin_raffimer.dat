A secondary objective was to evaluate <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> for reducing the incidence of allogeneic red blood cell transfusions. MethodsThis was a phase II, single-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, open-label study. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative autologous donation were randomized to receive a single dose of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> or control (10 % pentastarch). Patients were sequentially enrolled in a dose block of 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mL. ResultsSixty patients received <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> (n = 30) or control (n = 30). <b>Hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> was well tolerated. Most (98 %) adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. There was an expected dose-dependent increase {{in the incidence of}} blood pressure increases and jaundice in hemoglobin raffimer–treated patients. In a dose-pooled analysis of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> versus control, increased blood pressure (43 % vs 17 %), nausea (37 % vs 33 %), and atrial fibrillation (37 % vs 17 %) were the most frequently reported adverse events. All serious adverse events were considered unrelated or unlikely to be related to study drug. No hemoglobin raffimer–treated patient required an intraoperative allogeneic red blood cell transfusion, compared with 5 (17 %) pentastarch-treated patients (P =. 052). This advantage of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> was maintained at 24 hours after surgery (7 % vs 37 %; P =. 010) and up to 5 days after surgery (10 % vs 47 %; P =. 0034). ConclusionsHemoglobin raffimer was not associated with any serious adverse events in patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative autologous donation in a dose-response study up to 1000 mL. <b>Hemoglobin</b> <b>raffimer</b> was effective in facilitating decreased exposure or avoidance of allogeneic red blood cell transfusions when used in conjunction with intraoperative autologous donation...|$|E
