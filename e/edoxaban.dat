5000|$|Direct factor Xa inhibitors {{are being}} used {{clinically}} and their usage is constantly increasing. They are gradually taking over warfarin usage and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). [...] Indication for Xa inhibitors is preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) {{which can lead to}} pulmonary embolism. It is also used to treat atrial fibrillation to lower the risk of stroke caused by a blood clot. Another indication is a prophylactic treatment for blood clotting (thrombosis) due to atherosclerosis. Rivaroxaban was the first FXa inhibitor on the market and then followed by apixaban and <b>edoxaban.</b> One of the main disadvantages of these new drugs is the lack of reversibility and no antidotes are currently on the market.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{anticoagulants}} are available. The traditional ones (warfarin, other coumarins and heparins) are in widespread use. Since the 2000s {{a number of}} new agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). These agents include direct thrombin inhibitor(dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban and <b>edoxaban)</b> and they {{have been shown to be}} as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects. The newer anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACs), are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems. Additionally, there is no antidote for the factor Xa inhibitors, so it is difficult to stop their effects in the body in cases of emergency (accidents, urgent surgery). Idarucizumab was FDA approved for the reversal of dabigatran in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Warfarin {{treatment}} requires blood {{monitoring and}} dose adjustments regularly {{due to its}} narrow therapeutic window. If supervision isn't adequate warfarin poses a threat in causing, all too frequent, haemorrhagic events and multiple interactions with food and other drugs. Currently, the main problem with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the administration route, as {{it has to be}} given subcutaneously. Because of these disadvantages there has been an urgent need for better anticoagulant drugs. For a modern society, convenient and fast drug administration is the key to a good drug compliance. In 2008 the first direct Xa inhibitor was approved for clinical use. Direct Xa inhibitors are just as efficacious as LMWH and warfarin but they are given orally and don’t need as strict monitoring. Other Xa inhibitors advantages are rapid onset/offset, few drug interactions and predictable pharmacokinetics. The rapid onset/offset effect greatly reduces the need for “bridging” with parenteral anticoagulants after surgeries. Today there are three factor Xa inhibitors marketed: rivaroxaban, apixaban and <b>edoxaban.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Recommendations {{for those}} without cancer include anticoagulation (stopping further blood clots from forming) with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or <b>edoxaban</b> rather than {{warfarin}} or {{low molecular weight}} heparin (LMWH).

[...] No differences in mortality, prevention of major bleeding, or preventing VTEs from recurring were observed between LMWH and UFH. No differences have been detected in the route of administration of UFH (subcutaneous or intravenous). LMWH is usually administered by a subcutaneous injection, and a persons blood clotting factors {{do not have to be}} monitored as closely as with UFH. People with cancer have a higher risk of experiencing reoccurring VTE episodes ("recurrent VTE"), despite taking preventative anticoagulation medication. These people should be given therapeutic doses of LMWH medication, either by switching from another anticoagulant or by taking a higher dose of LMWH.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Edoxaban,</b> an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is in {{development}} for thromboprophylaxis, including prevention of stroke and systemic embolism {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF). P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter, modulates absorption and excretion of xenobiotics. <b>Edoxaban</b> is a P-gp substrate, and several cardiovascular (CV) drugs {{have the potential to}} inhibit P-gp and increase drug exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential pharmacokinetic interactions of <b>edoxaban</b> and 6 cardiovascular drugs used in the management of AF and known P-gp substrates/inhibitors. METHODS: Drug-drug interaction studies with <b>edoxaban</b> and CV drugs with known P-gp substrate/inhibitor potential were conducted in healthy subjects. In 4 crossover, 2 -period, 2 -treatment studies, subjects received <b>edoxaban</b> 60 mg alone and coadministered with quinidine 300 mg (n = 42), verapamil 240 mg (n = 34), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 32), or dronedarone 400 mg (n = 34). Additionally, <b>edoxaban</b> 60 mg alone and coadministered with amiodarone 400 mg (n = 30) or digoxin 0. 25 mg (n = 48) was evaluated in a single-sequence study and 2 -cohort study, respectively. RESULTS: <b>Edoxaban</b> exposure measured as area under the curve increased for concomitant administration of <b>edoxaban</b> with quinidine (76. 7 %), verapamil (52. 7 %), amiodarone (39. 8 %), and dronedarone (84. 5 %), and exposure measured as 24 -h concentrations for quinidine (11. 8 %), verapamil (29. 1 %), and dronedarone (157. 6 %) also increased.

40|$|Introduction. The main {{adverse effect}} of {{anticoagulant}} therapy is bleeding, and major bleeding, including intracranial, gastrointestinal, and retroperitoneal bleeding, {{has been reported}} as an adverse effect of <b>edoxaban,</b> a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Bleeding during systemic anticoagulation with <b>edoxaban</b> presents a therapeutic conundrum, because there is currently no safe or efficacious reversal agent to stop major bleeding. Case Report. A 51 -year-old woman had multiple traumatic injuries, including lower limb fractures. On day 8, she developed deep venous thrombosis, and <b>edoxaban</b> was administered orally. On day 38, she developed fungemia, which was treated with an antifungal drug. On day 43, she presented with dyspnea. Chest computed tomography scan showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities in the whole lung fields. The results of the subsequent workup (i. e., serum levels of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody) and microbiological study were unremarkable. Based on these findings, her condition was diagnosed as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) associated with <b>edoxaban</b> therapy. The lung opacities disappeared spontaneously after <b>edoxaban</b> therapy was discontinued. Conclusion. DAH is a dangerous complication associated with <b>edoxaban</b> therapy.

40|$|<b>Edoxaban</b> is an oral direct factor Xa {{inhibitor}} that {{is currently}} undergoing investigation in phase III clinical trials {{for the prevention of}} stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Factor Xa is an attractive target for anticoagulant treatment, as it is the primary and rate-limiting source of amplification in the coagulation cascade. <b>Edoxaban</b> is a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa and has > 10 [*] 000 -fold greater selectivity for factor Xa relative to thrombin. In phase I clinical trials, the anticoagulant effects of <b>edoxaban</b> included dose-dependent increases in activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time following single <b>edoxaban</b> doses of 10 - 150 [*]mg and after multiple ascending doses (60 [*]mg twice daily, 90 [*]mg daily and 120 [*]mg daily). The anticoagulant effects of <b>edoxaban</b> were rapid in onset (time to peak plasma concentration 1 - 2 hours) and sustained for up to 24 hours. Prolongation of bleeding time in 8 % of subjects was > 9. 5 minutes (none of which appeared to be clinically significant) 2 hours after initial dosing, and was independent of <b>edoxaban</b> dose, formulation or dietary state. In general, plasma <b>edoxaban</b> concentrations were linearly correlated with coagulation parameters. Phase II clinical trials in patients with AF and VTE suggest that the <b>edoxaban</b> 30 [*]mg once-daily and 60 [*]mg once-daily regimens had a similar or better safety profile compared with dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio 2. 0 - 3. 0) in terms of bleeding events, and that <b>edoxaban</b> was not associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition, <b>edoxaban</b> was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reductions in VTE after orthopaedic surgery compared with placebo or dalteparin sodium. Further clinical investigation of the efficacy and safety of once-daily <b>edoxaban</b> is being conducted in phase III clinical trials in comparison with warfarin in patients with AF in the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial (NCT 00781391), and in comparison with low-molecular weight heparin/warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in the HOKUSAI VTE trial (NCT 00986154) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWhen {{compared}} with warfarin, <b>edoxaban</b> significantly reduced cardiovascular mortality in the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) trial. We studied the possible reasons leading to this reduction. MethodsENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was a double-blind, double-dummy comparison of warfarin with 2 regimens of once-daily <b>edoxaban</b> in 21, 105 patients with atrial fibrillation followed for 2. 8 years (median). Causes of {{deaths in the}} intention-to-treat population were classified as cardiovascular (including fatal bleeding and ischemic stroke), malignancy, or noncardiovascular/nonmalignancy by an independent, blinded, clinical endpoint committee. Deaths also were adjudicated as directly due to bleeding (ie, fatal), or bleeding contributing to death, or neither. ResultsThere were 839 total deaths (4. 35 %/y) in the warfarin arm, {{compared with}} 773 (3. 99 %/y, P =. 08) with the higher-dose <b>edoxaban</b> regimen, and 737 (3. 80 %/y, P =. 006) with the lower-dose <b>edoxaban</b> regimen. No significant differences between treatments were observed in (1) any of the 3 most common causes of cardiovascular death (sudden cardiac, heart failure, ischemic stroke), (2) fatal malignancies, (3) other noncardiovascular death. There were 124 fatal bleeds, 65 with warfarin, significantly fewer with the higher-dose (n = 35, P =. 003) and lower-dose (n = 24, P <. 001) <b>edoxaban</b> regimens. There were 101 bleeding events with warfarin that were either fatal or that contributed to death. There were significantly fewer with the higher-dose (n = 59, P =. 001) and lower-dose (n = 54, P <. 001) <b>edoxaban</b> regimens. ConclusionsFewer total and cardiovascular deaths were observed with <b>edoxaban</b> as compared with warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, and this predominantly resulted from the significantly lower rate of major bleeding with <b>edoxaban.</b> <b>Edoxaban</b> reduces mortality both directly (less fatal bleeding) and indirectly (fewer bleeding-related complications and interruptions in therapy after nonfatal bleeding) ...|$|E

This is the first report on the clinical relevance and management of bleeding events with <b>edoxaban.</b> All major bleeding events were classified blindly by three study-independent adjudicators. Pre-defined criteria were used to classify severity of clinical presentation and, separately, the clinical course and outcome into four categories. Major bleeding occurred in 56 patients treated with <b>edoxaban</b> and 65 patients treated with VKA. The severest categories (3 or 4) of the clinical presentation were assigned to 46 % of the major bleeding episodes in <b>edoxaban</b> recipients versus 58 % of the major bleeds in VKA recipients (odds ratio [OR] 0. 62, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 30 - 1. 27, p = 0. 19). Clinical course was classified as severe (category 3 or 4) in 23 % of the <b>edoxaban</b> and 29 % of the VKA associated bleeds (OR 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 32 - 1. 66, p = 0. 46). In conclusion, <b>edoxaban</b> associated major bleeding events have a comparable clinical presentation and course to major bleeds with VKA in patients treated for venous thromboembolism in the Hokusai-VTE study. These results may assure physicians that it is safe to prescribe this medication. If a major bleeding during <b>edoxaban</b> treatment occurs, its clinical presentation and clinical course are not worse than in VKA-treated patient...|$|E

It is the fourth target-specific oral anticoagulant to be approved. <b>Edoxaban</b> is noninferior for efficacy compared to warfarin for both approved indications. <b>Edoxaban</b> is superior to warfarin for the first major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event in venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. <b>Edoxaban</b> is dosed once daily for both indications and requires dose adjustment for renal function. In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, use is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 95 mL/min due to reduced efficacy. <b>Edoxaban</b> offers a new therapeutic alternative to the currently available options in the market.

40|$|AbstractEdoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, {{has proven}} {{antithrombotic}} efficacy. In a multicenter, phase II study, 264 {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) patients randomly received <b>edoxaban</b> 15 or 30 mg once daily or enoxaparin 2000 IU (20 -mg) twice daily for 11 – 14 days. Thromboembolic event incidences were 3. 8 % (3 / 78), 2. 8 % (2 / 72), and 4. 1 % (3 / 74) for <b>edoxaban</b> 15 -mg, 30 -mg, and enoxaparin, respectively (P= 1. 00). Edoxaban-induced prolongation of prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} were proportional to plasma <b>edoxaban</b> concentration. Major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding incidences were 2. 2 % (2 / 89), 1. 2 % (1 / 85), and 2. 3 % (2 / 87) for <b>edoxaban</b> 15 -mg, 30 -mg, and enoxaparin, respectively (P= 1. 00).

Statistical significant exposure-response relationships were recurrent VTE with hazard ratio (HR) based on average <b>edoxaban</b> concentration at steady state (C-av) (HRCav) 50. 98 (i. e., change in the HR with every 1 ng/mL increase of C-av); the composite of recurrent DVT and nonfatal PE with HRC(av) 50. 99; and the composite of recurrent DVT, nonfatal PE, and all-cause mortality HRC(av) 50. 98, and all death using maximal <b>edoxaban</b> concentration (C-max) with HR (C-max) 50. 99. No statistical significant exposure-response relationships were found for clinically relevant bleeding or major adverse cardiovascular event.

40|$|Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) {{remain the}} {{standard}} therapy for anticoagulation in {{prevention and treatment}} of venous throm-boembolism (VTE) and {{for the prevention of}} stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). Due to numerous limitations of VKAs, target-specific oral anticoagulants have been developed. <b>Edoxaban</b> is a direct activated factor X inhibitor with attractive features among which are once daily dosing, no need for routine monitoring, and minimal drug–drug interactions. In patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, <b>edoxaban</b> was superior to enoxaparin in preventing VTE. Furthermore, a recent large-scale phase III trial in patients with symptomatic VTE demonstrated that <b>edoxaban</b> was noninferior to warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE and reduced bleeding. In the largest trial of anticoagulation in patients with AF to date, <b>edoxaban</b> was noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and reduced bleeding and cardiovascular mortality.
