40|$|M. Comm. The current {{economic}} {{conditions in the}} country have compelled various enterprises {{at one time or}} another to stop operating in their field or to reduce the number of their work force. Redundancies with large redundancy packages have become the order of the day. These are associated with withdrawals from pension or provident funds. This study is divided in three main sections: In the first section the taxability of lump sums (excluding receipts from pension and provident funds) was investigated. In accordance to paragraph (d) of the definition of Gross Income as stipulated in section 1 of the Income Tax Act, the following amounts are included in gross income: [...] . any amount, including any voluntary award, received or accrued in respect of the relinguishment, termination, loss, repudiation, cancellation or variation of any office or employment of any appointment (or right or claim to be appointed) to any office or employment [...] . " From the said definition it is clear that even voluntary awards made by employers to employees under certain circumstances will form part from their Gross Income. The type of the amounts and the circumstances under which they form part of a taxpayer's Gross Income were taken into account. Particular attention was devoted to lump sum receipts from redundancy packages, accumulated leave money, voluntary awards and <b>deferred</b> <b>remuneration</b> schemes. The tax implications for both the employer and employee were considered in detail. Tax consultants are often approached by taxpayers for advice on converting a pension fund to a provident fund or on the tax implications of lump sums received from the said funds. The main purpose of this section of the study was to find possible solutions for such issues. This section of the study dealt exclusively with pension and provident funds. Particular attention was paid to the following aspects: To what requirements pension and provident funds had to comply in order for the Commisioner to approve such funds; What tax implications do contributions by employer and employee hold for these funds; The tax implications of lump sums received on retirement, death or resignation on these funds; and Other implications that could influence membership to these funds. The conclusion was that it was not possible to institute a general guideline. In addition to the tax implications of the said funds, there were also various other factors that influenced the choice between provident and pension funds. Some factors that must be borne in mind and that must be incorporated in any decision are the following: The degree of schooling of the employee; The amount of remuneration received; The life expectation of the employee; and The financial knowledge of the taxpayer to invest the lump sum successfully. The study was concluded with a brief discussion of benefit funds with specific reference to medical schemes and benefit schemes as well as the recommendations of the Katz Commission (1994 : 91 - 93) on pension, provident and benefit funds...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{contractual}} {{relationship between the}} manager and the firm. The results indicate that cross-sectional variation in the components of management remuneration plans {{can be explained by}} variations in the specificity of both the manager's human capital investments and the firm's resources. Where the returns on the firm's resources are relatively more dependent upon (specific to) a particular manager, that manager {{is more likely to be}} able to negotiate his/her remuneration. The manager is also more likely to be paid on a long run contingent basis and to be offered <b>deferred</b> forfeitable <b>remuneration.</b> The results also indicate that the greater the firm-specificity of a manager's human capital investments the greater the likelihood that the manager is offered termination compensation as part of the remuneration package...|$|R
