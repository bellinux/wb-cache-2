Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and because the man was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because {{they are supposed to be}} friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship.
