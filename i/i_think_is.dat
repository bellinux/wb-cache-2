25|$|On February 5, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds {{stated the}} {{following}} in an interview: We support {{the freedom of}} speech, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> very clear. But {{at the same time}} it is important to say that with this freedom comes a certain responsibility, and it could be objectionable to act in a way that insults people.|$|E
25|$|As this prudent economy, {{which some}} people call Saving, is in private {{families}} the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) {{will have the same}} effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours. This, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> an error.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped {{to a low of}} just 19percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>was</b> natural perversity; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>was</b> false pride {{at getting}} over sea-sickness; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>was</b> reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of {{me not to}} go to sea." ...|$|R

And {{people who were}} close to me are no long there or no longer close to me ... the things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> worth fighting for and believe in, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> still the same ...

500|$|Hibbs said of Speech and Worship [...] "To me {{they are}} great human {{documents}} {{in the form of}} paint and canvas. A great picture, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> one which moves and inspires millions of people. The Four Freedoms did [...] do so." [...] Westbrook notes that Rockwell presents [...] "individual dissent" [...] that acts to [...] "protect private conscience from the state." [...] Another writer describes the theme of the work as [...] "civility", a theme of days gone by.|$|E

Jackman said, [...] "There’s no doubt that the most {{important}} relationship in his life is — we’ve seen through the movies — is his relationship with Jean Grey. Yes, we saw her die at the end of ‘X-Men: The Last Stand,’ but in this movie, she has a presence, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> vital to the movie, particularly for him confronting the most difficult thing within himself." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Polkarama!", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} during the second parody session. Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E

500|$|When a CBC Radio {{interviewer}} {{suggested to}} Franklin that her ideas about {{peace and justice}} were not connected with what was actually happening {{in the aftermath of}} 9/11, she [...] readily agreed. [...] "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{attempted}} to develop characters {{that offer a}} unique experience to the game. [...] "The overarching goal for us was about building an ensemble of genuinely interesting characters we wanted to interact with," [...] said Matthies. They also strived to connect the thoughts and actions of all characters to the human experience, allowing players to know [...] "why a person is doing what they are doing". Matthies feels that all characters, particularly the allies, contain some dimension of his own personality. [...] "They're an expression of something {{that is part of}} me that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> interesting to explore," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{had just}} retired from touring {{after one of}} the most {{difficult}} periods of their career, including the [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] controversy and the band's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Lennon talked about the song in 1980: [...] "I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius – 'I mean it must be high or low'", and explaining that the song was [...] "psycho-analysis set to music".|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{were not}} so very near, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>were</b> we?' she asked quickly. 'If we <b>were,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you were--very good to take my hand.' ...|$|R

500|$|Danny Boyle, the film's director, {{speaking}} on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, [...] " [...] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the Centennial Corporation {{had decided}} what design {{elements}} {{it wanted to}} see on the half dollar, Fraser had to do her own interpretation of the designs SB had essayed. Hired on June 15, she completed her models by July 1, when Louis Ayres, {{a member of the}} commission, came to view them. He was enthusiastic, and sent a letter to commission chairman Charles Moore to that effect, writing [...] "the whole coin looks very interesting to me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> mighty good." [...] The models were approved by the commission, and then by Mellon. Dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint, then shipped to San Francisco, where the coins were to be struck.|$|E
500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, and Tim McCord in New York City and the {{production}} was handled by Nick Raskulinecz. During an interview with MTV News in June, Lee talked about the song saying, [...] " [...] the song that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the first single is the song that wraps it all up. It's got a cool meaning, {{a lot of great}} lyrics going on, it also just smacks you right in the face and it's heavy and it's great." [...] She noted that the song was a departure from the band's previous material and acknowledged that they wanted the new single to be [...] "more than a hit".|$|E

500|$|When {{asked how}} KFC felt about their {{portrayal}} in [...] "Medicinal Fried Chicken", company spokesman Ricky Maynard said only: [...] "As you might expect, KFC Corporation was not contacted by Comedy Central {{for permission to}} use our brand in South Park. We had absolutely no say in the show's content." [...] Corbin Tourism Chairperson Suzie Razmus viewed the association of Corbin with KFC as positive publicity, regardless of the show's tone. The city embarked on a campaign to capitalize on its connections to KFC and Colonel Sanders, and Sharae Myers, the city's Main Street manager, said of the episode, [...] "One thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> great is that Corbin got the recognition: that the mecca for KFC is in Corbin." ...|$|E
500|$|The Harry Potter {{series has}} been criticised for {{supposedly}} supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling {{refused to speak}} out about her religion, stating, [...] "If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, {{will be able to}} guess what's coming in the books". However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows. For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross. Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that [...] "my belief and my struggling with religious belief... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out. Which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E

500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|A new costume was {{required}} for Ryan once Seven had the majority of her Borg implants removed. She wore a new silver jumpsuit for the following several episodes. During the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor", [...] director Jesús Salvador Treviño criticized the outfit, saying that [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasizing her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug"; she wore a corset-like device which gave her the appearance of mechanical ribs. Treviño praised Ryan's third costume, which replaced the silver jumpsuit, noting how it reduced her sexual characteristics: [...] "It is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then you {{get away from that}} titillation stuff which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about".|$|E
500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E

40|$|What is a {{chameleon}} in {{the world}} of education? What defines her professionally, personally, and why? In this autoethnography, I explore the chameleon metaphor for meanings and implications in my personal and professional identity as a female educator by seeking answers to questions stemming from Mitchell and Weber (2005) : Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> I analyzed my own autobiographical journals using the four-part Listening Guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bertsch, 2003) coupled with theme-based family coding to examine changes by choice and changes by force particular to my personal and professional experiences. Notions of home, belonging, and change as a journey emerged as themes that served to frame my identity and highlighted the importance of self-inquiry for educators as an applied practice within the greater context of the profession...|$|R
