5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cucurbita are {{susceptible}} to some types of mosaic virus including: Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Papaya ringspot virus-cucurbit strain (PRSV), Squash mosaic virus (SqMV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). PRSV {{is the only one}} of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> plants.|$|E

However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to {{retrieve}} Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships.

After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds.

5|$|Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) copes {{with her}} failed {{marriage}} to Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.). She tries to move on, but mementos {{of the past}} do not let her. Her best friend Will (Eric McCormack) tries to help her but to no avail. While at dinner with his boyfriend Vince (Bobby Cannavale), and Vince's superior officer, Grace calls him, displeasing Vince. Believing that Grace might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> his relationship with Will because she is too needy. This prompts Grace and Vince to bicker, with the two asking Will to choose between them. He cannot choose between them as Grace is his long-time friend, but he also cares for Vince. The episode concludes with him telling Vince {{that he wants to}} work things out, but before they can discuss it, Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

Over 2,196 people have died since the outbreak began to spread rapidly at the end of April 2017.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor in}} the drop in {{investment}} is that modern industrial development in Brazil is constrained {{by a lack of}} modern infrastructure, especially in logistics and electric power generation, along with cumbersome regulations relating to business registration, taxation or bankruptcy, all resulting in a high cost of doing business.

25|$|Deforestation <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> Africa {{at twice}} the world rate, {{according}} to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate {{for the rest of}} the world. Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed. Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago. About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.|$|E
25|$|Ship emissions, mercury, aluminium, vanadium, manganese, and aerosol {{and ozone}} {{pollutants}} are {{many examples of}} the pollution that <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> this atmosphere, but the smoke from forest fires is not a significant contributor. Some of those pollutants figure among environmental effects of coal burning. Due to low deposition rates, these pollutants are not yet having adverse effects on people or animals. Different pollutants actually represent different colors of haze. Dr. Shaw discovered in 1976 that the yellowish haze is from dust storms in China and Mongolia. The particles were carried polwards by unusual air currents. The trapped particles were dark gray the next year he took a sample. That {{was caused by a}} heavy amount of industrial pollutants.|$|E

25|$|Today, it is {{becoming}} increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage. To understand the ramifications of these practices, exergy is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of emissions, fuels, and other sources of energy. Combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing the environmental impacts of burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The current methods for analyzing the emissions from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the atmosphere. In this way, it is easier to determine how human action <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> the natural environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of controversial political appointments {{to the highest}} offices of the Institutions of the European Union - who have failed to garner favourable public opinion for their vision of the European project and demonstrate leadership required to steer the European project - has resulted in successful electoral challenges to prevent any further devolution of sovereignty from the national parliaments to the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels. European electorates have become deeply suspicious of the democratic deficit, corporate lobbying activities and opacity of political arrangements brokered in Brussels. The transition from authoritarian rule to libertarian democracy has not been fully completed by Eastern European countries and <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> the elimination of corruption & nepotism, religious & ethnic tolerance, humanitarian solidarity, respect of human rights, etc.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has surrounded how the financial crisis (2007 - ?) <b>is</b> <b>affecting</b> retirement decisions, with the conventional wisdom saying that fewer people will retire since their savings have been depleted; however recent research suggests that the opposite may happen. Using data from the HRS, researchers examined trends in defined benefit (DB) vs. defined contribution (DC) pension plans and found that those nearing retirement had only limited exposure to the recent stock market decline and thus are not likely to substantially delay their retirement. At the same time, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), another study estimates that mass layoffs are likely to lead to an increase in retirement almost 50% larger than the decrease brought about by the stock market crash, so that on net retirements are likely to increase in response to the crisis.|$|E
