40|$|Purpose: To {{compare and}} {{evaluate}} the dosimetric water equivalence of several commonly used solid phantoms for low energy photon beams. Methods: A total of ten different solid phantom materials {{was used in the}} study. The PENELOPE Monte Carlo code was used to calculate <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> and beam profiles in all the phantom materials as well as the dose to a small water voxel at the surface of the solid phantom. These doses were compared to the corresponding doses calculated in a water phantom. The primary photon beams used ranged in energy from 50 to 280 kVp. Results: A number of phantom materials had excellent agreement in dose compared to water for all the x-ray beam energies studied. RMI 457 Solid Water, Virtual Water, PAGAT, A 150, and Plastic Water DT all had <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> that agreed with those in water to within 2 %. For these same phantom materials, the dose changes in the water voxel at the surface of the solid phantom were within 2 %, except for A 150, which agreed to within 2. 7 %. By comparison, the largest differences in <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> occurred for Plastic Water (- 21. 7 %) and polystyrene (17. 6 %) for the 50 kVp energy photon beam and 8 cm diameter field size. Plastic Water gave the largest difference in the normalized beam profiles with differences of up to 3. 5 % as compared to water. Surface dose changes, due to the presence of the solid phantom acting as the backscatter material, were found to be up to 9. 1 % for polystyrene with significant differences also found for Plastic Water, PMMA, and RW 3 phantoms. Conclusions: The following solid phantoms can be considered water equivalent and are recommended for relative dosimetry of low energy photon beams: A 150, PAGAT, Plastic Water DT, RMI 457 Solid Water, and Virtual Water. However, the following solid phantoms give significant differences, compared to water, in <b>depth</b> <b>doses,</b> profiles, and/or in surface doses due to backscatter changes: Plastic Water, PMMA, polystyrene, PRESAGE, and RW 3. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|When {{converting}} fractional (percentage) <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> to tissue-phantom ratios, {{one must}} use {{a factor that}} accounts for the different source-to-point distances.

The second correction factor reflects differences related to scattered photons and electrons at the depth of normalization in the two geometries.

In this work, Bland-Altman analysis has been applied to radiation dosimetry to compare the PTW Markus and Roos parallel plate ionisation chambers and a PTW PinPoint chamber against a Farmer type ionisation chamber which is accepted as the gold standard for radiation dosimetry in the clinic. <b>Depth</b> <b>doses</b> for low energy x-rays beams with energies of 50, 75 and 100 kVp were measured using each of the ionisation chambers. <b>Depth</b> <b>doses</b> were also calculated by interpolation of the data in the British Journal of Radiology (BJR) Report 25. From the Bland-Altman analysis, the mean dose difference between the two parallel plate chambers and the Farmer chambers was 1 % over the range of depths measured. The PinPoint chamber gave significant dose differences compared to the Farmer chamber. There were also differences of up to 12 % between the BJR Report 25 <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> and the measured data.

Measurements were carried out for a dual high energy (6 - 15 MV) Varian DHX-S linear accelerator using ionization chambers for beam axis measurements (wedge factors and <b>depth</b> <b>doses),</b> film dosimetry for offaxis dose profiles measurements, and a diode matrix detector for two dimensional absolute dose distributions. Using both calculation algorithms, different configuration of symmetric and asymmetric fields varying the wedge’s angle were tested. Accuracy of the treatment planning system was evaluated in terms of percentage differences between measured and calculated values for wedge factors, <b>depth</b> <b>doses,</b> and profiles. As far as the absolute dose distribution was concerned, the gamma index method (Low et al.

Wedge factors and percentage <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> were within 1 % deviation between calculated and measured values. The comparison of measured and calculated dose profiles shows that the Van Dyk’s acceptance criteria (Van Dyk et al.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{well known}} that photon beam {{radiation}} therapy requires dose calculation algorithms. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure and assess the ability of pencil beam convolution (PBC) and anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) to predict doses beyond high density heterogeneity. Materials and Methods: An inhomogeneous phantom of five layers was created in Eclipse planning system (version 8. 6. 15). Each layer of phantom was assigned in terms of water (first or top), air (second), water (third), bone (fourth), and water (fifth or bottom) medium. <b>Depth</b> <b>doses</b> in water (bottom medium) were calculated for 100 monitor units (MUs) with 6 Megavoltage (MV) photon beam for different field sizes using AAA and PBC with heterogeneity correction. Combinations of solid water, Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC), and Styrofoam were then manufactured to mimic phantoms and doses for 100 MUs were acquired with cylindrical ionization chamber at selected depths beyond high density heterogeneity interface. The measured and calculated <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> were then compared. Results: AAA′s values had better agreement with measurements at all measured <b>depths.</b> <b>Dose</b> overestimation by AAA (up to 5. 3 %) and by PBC (up to 6. 7 %) was found to be higher in proximity to the high-density heterogeneity interface, and the dose discrepancies were more pronounced for larger field sizes. The errors in dose estimation by AAA and PBC may be due to improper beam modeling of primary beam attenuation or lateral scatter contributions or combination of both in heterogeneous media that include low and high density materials.

To assess <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> curve required by clinicians and dose uniformity over a whole treatment plane, combinations of different irradiation parameters are used (electron energy, beam angle, scatterers).

The connecting cable acts as a secondary Compton current source that produces a very small Compton current which depends on the field size and the photon beam quality, becoming the dominant source when the PEEC is placed at depths greater than the <b>depth</b> of maximum <b>dose.</b> A study of the dose build-up region of megavoltage photon beams showed that the percentage depth ionizations obtained from measurements are higher than the percentage <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> obtained with Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. To validate the MC-calculated percentage <b>depth</b> <b>doses,</b> the design of the PEEC was incorporated in the simulations. While the MC-calculated and measured percentage depth ionizations in the dose build-up region agreed with one another for the 6 MV, a non-negligible difference is observed for the 18 MV x-ray beam. A number of experiments and theoretical studies of various possible effects which could be the source of this discrepancy is investigated. We show that the contribution of contaminating neutrons and protons to the doses in the 18 MV x-ray beam is negligible. Moreover, the MC calculations using the XCOM photon cross sections database and the NIST bremsstrahlung differential cross sections do not explain the discrepancy between the MC calculations and measurement in the dose build-up region for the 18 MV and this discrepancy is yet to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|PRESAGE is a {{dosimeter}} that {{is suitable}} for 3 D dosimetry. To {{be used as an}} ideal dosimeter, however, it should present radiologically water equivalent properties. In this work, we have investigated the radiological properties of three different PRESAGE® formulations. The radiological water equivalence was assessed by comparing the photon cross sections and radiation dosimetry properties of the three different PRESAGE® formulations with the corresponding values for water. Relative <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> were calculated using Monte Carlo methods for 75, 125, 180 and 280 kVp and 6 MV x-ray beams. Based on the results of this study, the PRESAGE® formulations with lower halogen content are more dosimetrically water equivalent. 5 page(s...|$|R
