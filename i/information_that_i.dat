2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, we {{describe}} an important critic {{in the life}} cycle concern : The Manufacturabuity Critic. Our solution is predicated on the blackboard architecture framework of several experts interacting to create a design in a concurrent fashion. In the current research, the life cycle concern that we address is the manufacturability of single-piece, "shell-like" products such as those found in injection molding, casting, extrusion, and sheet metal cutting. The manufacturabitity critic described in this paper is a knowledge-based system. The knowledge for the system was derived from manufacturing experts and design handbooks. From examination of these sources of knowledge, we found {{that most of the}} knowledge associated with shell-like products Is based on geometric or physical forms on the products known as features (Gadh [10], Gadh (11], Henderson [15]). Features and information about features are typically not available directly from most CAD systems, and thus need to be extracted from the <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>Is</b> available. In the current research, we show a heuristic-based method for extracting features from a Boundary Representation (BREP) Solid Model CAD descnption. These features are input into the manufacturability critic, which critiques the part for various problems in manufacturing such as ejectability, shrinkage, distortion, etc...|$|R
