40|$|A special <b>insert</b> was {{developed}} <b>for</b> <b>centrifuge</b> cups {{in order to}} prepare leukocyte-poor platelet concentrates from buffy coats by using quadruple citrate phosphate dextrose-saline adenine glucose mannitol systems from different manufacturers. Each centrifuge cup could contain up to 4 sets of double bags allowing the preparation of 24 platelet concentrates per run. Optimal conditions for centrifugation of the buffy coats in the inserts {{were found to be}} 6 min at 380 g (2, 150 g min). A platelet count of 69 +/- 19 X 10 (9) and a leukocyte contamination of 14 +/- 10. 5 X 10 (6) per platelet concentrate was thereby obtained in a plasma volume of 63 +/- 10. 5 ml (mean +/- SD). The method described allows large scale production of leukocyte-poor platelet concentrates from buffy coats in a closed syste...|$|R

30|$|SPC {{methods for}} RCP testing {{for the two}} {{existing}} formulations of 99 mTc-MAG 3, heated (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015) and non-heated (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006) differ and results are not {{in accordance with the}} Ph.Eur. specifications. Our new two-strip TLC method, combining two separations on the same type of support with two different solvent mixtures, {{has been found to be}} adequate for the determination of the RCP of 99 mTc-MAG 3 (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003). The RCP obtained by TLC does not deviate significantly from the reference RCP determined by HPLC and PC following the Ph.Eur. method (European Pharmacopoeia Edition 7.0, 2008). The limit value for the total RCP is identic. This was not the case in former proposed methods where some impurities have been excluded and declared as insignificant (Seetharaman et al., 2006; Chen et al., 1993; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3, 2015; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3, 2015; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit, n.d.-a; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit, n.d.-b). The specificity and accuracy of our method have been confirmed and results of total RCP are in very good agreement with the Ph.Eur. reference method. The limit of detection meets the limit test criteria necessary to identify the total amount of impurities in a TLC QC method. Its precision and robustness have been successfully validated. Results of the intermediate fidelity show a good correlation with the Ph.Eur. reference values, both for the TLC-scanner and the dose calibrator measurements. This two-strip TLC method could therefore be established for routine quality control of 99 mTc-MAG 3 kits by introducing it into the SPC of the products (Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006; Package <b>insert</b> <b>for</b> Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015).|$|R
