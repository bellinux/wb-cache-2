25|$|Because {{wind-powered}} vehicles typically sail at {{apparent wind}} angles {{aligned with the}} leading edge of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. Low <b>forward</b> <b>resistance</b> to motion, high speeds over the surface, and high lateral resistance help create high apparent wind speeds—with closer alignment of the apparent wind to the course traveled for most points of sail—and allow wind-powered vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft.|$|E
25|$|At low to {{moderate}} speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through {{water that is}} approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low <b>forward</b> <b>resistance</b> allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading {{to the use of}} wingsails in racing craft.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} use in unattended and hostile deployment environments, the security in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) has attracted much interest {{in the past two}} decades. However, it remains a challenge to design a lightweight authentication protocol for WSNs because the designers are confronted with a series of desirable security requirements, e. g., user anonymity, perfect <b>forward</b> secrecy, <b>resistance</b> to de-synchronization attack. Recently, the authors presented two authentication schemes that attempt to provide user anonymity and to resist various known attacks. Unfortunately, in this work we shall show that user anonymity of the two schemes is achieved at the price of an impractical search operation—the gateway node may search for every possible value. Besides this defect, they are also prone to smart card loss attacks and have no provision for perfect forward secrecy. As our main contribution, a lightweight anonymous authentication scheme with perfect forward secrecy is designed, and what we believe the most interesting feature is that user anonymity, perfect <b>forward</b> secrecy, and <b>resistance</b> to de-synchronization attack can be achieved at the same time. As far as we know, it is extremely difficult to meet these security features simultaneously only using the lightweight operations, such as symmetric encryption/decryption and hash functions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{protocols}} use Diffie-Hellman key agreement, {{combined with}} certified long-term values or digital signatures for authentication.

In this paper, we develop an algebraic version of the sym-bolic approach, working directly within finite fields, the natural structures for the protocols. The adversary, in giving {{an attack on a}} protocol goal in a finite field, may rely on any identity in that field. He defeats the protocol if there are attacks in infinitely many finite fields.

50|$|A sailboats speed {{through the}} water {{is limited by the}} {{resistance}} that results from hull drag in the water. Sail boats on foils are much less limited. Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft. Craft with the higher <b>forward</b> <b>resistance</b> achieve lower forward velocities for a given wind velocity than ice boats, which can travel at speeds several multiples of the true wind speed. Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sail boats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where its possible to align {{the leading edge of the}} sail with the apparent wind.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>resistance</b> {{comprises}} {{the types of}} drag that impede a sailboat's speed through water (or an ice boat's speed over the surface) include components of parasitic drag, consisting primarily of form drag, which arises because of {{the shape of the}} hull. and skin friction, which arises from the friction of the water (for boats) or air (for ice boats and land sailing craft) against the [...] "skin" [...] of the hull that is moving through it. Displacement vessels are also subject to wave resistance from the energy that goes into displacing water into waves and that is limited by hull speed, which is a function of waterline length, Wheeled vehicles' forward speed is subject to rolling friction and ice boats are subject to kinetic or sliding friction. Parasitic drag in water or air increases with the square of speed (VB2 or VA2, respectively); rolling friction increases linearly with velocity; whereas kinetic friction is normally a constant, but on ice may become reduced with speed as it transitions to lubricated friction with melting.|$|E
