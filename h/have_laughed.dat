25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E

[...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E

500|$|John Williams {{composed}} the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award {{and was later}} ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute. The main [...] "shark" [...] theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes — variously identified as [...] "E and F" [...] or [...] "F and F sharp" [...] — became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as [...] "grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable." [...] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that {{he wanted it to}} sound [...] "a little more threatening". When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to <b>have</b> <b>laughed,</b> thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked [...] "pirate music", which he called [...] "primal, but fun and entertaining". Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of La mer by Claude Debussy as well of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E

500|$|According to {{crew member}} Harmen Koops, on , Krause {{ordered him to}} bring on deck some assegais, or African spears, and some swords, for the Malagasy to clean. The assegais had been {{acquired}} on Madagascar along with the Malagasy, {{some of whom were}} experienced in the use of this weapon. Krause believed himself to be intellectually superior to the Malagasy, and is reported to <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> when issuing his order, saying he was sure that others would doubt his wisdom; having set the task, he went below deck for a meal. When the Malagasy had cleaned the weapons and were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, killing all who were left on deck, including Krause, who had returned when the attack began. Also killed in this fight were two of the ship's mates, Bender and Albert, leaving only Daniel Carel Gulik surviving of that rank. Some of the surviving crew climbed into the rigging, and others, including Gulik, Koops, Jan de Leeuw, and Krause's assistant Olof Leij, withdrew to the Constapelskamer, or gunroom, which was below decks at the stern of the ship, near the rudder. Captain Muller, who stated that he had been [...] "gazing out over the sea" [...] {{at the time of the}} attack, was taken by surprise and stabbed three times by Massavana. Muller escaped to his cabin and soon climbed down from a window, via the rudder, to join the others in the gunroom. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had been thrown overboard with others from the rigging, managed to swim around the ship to a rope hanging from the gunroom window, and was pulled to safety by his shipmates. Although the crew who had climbed into the rigging threatened the Malagasy from the fore-mast with hand grenades, [...] "only those that reached the safety of the barricaded ... escaped a brutal death." [...] With Krause dead and Muller wounded, Olof Leij was left in charge of the remaining crew below deck.|$|E

2500|$|Cartoonist Al Capp, {{creator of}} the comic strip Li'l Abner, satirized Baez as [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] during the 1960s.

Capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as [...] "A Tale of Bagels and Bacon" [...] and [...] "Molotov Cocktails for Two". Although Baez was upset by the parody in 1966, she admits to being more amused in recent years. [...] "I wish I could <b>have</b> <b>laughed</b> at this at the time", she wrote in a caption {{under one of the}} strips, reprinted in her autobiography. [...] "Mr. Capp confused me considerably. I'm sorry he's not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle."
