40|$|<b>Fire-breaks,</b> by legislation, are burnt {{annually}} before mid-winter in {{the southern}} Drakensberg, affecting 5 - 10 % of the landscape, and resulting in marked selection for the early season flush by both livestock and wildlife. This study investigated whether this severe defoliation regime has {{had an effect on}} surface soil properties, botanical composition, plant diversity, phytomass production, and the nutrient content of phytomass by comparing paired samples of grassland and immediately adjacent <b>fire-breaks.</b> <b>Fire-breaks</b> differed quantitatively in composition from adjacent grassland although both were characterised as Themeda triandra-Tristachya leucothrix grassland. Only two grass species of lesser abundance, Brachiaria serrata and Eragrostis racemosa, were clearly more abundant on <b>fire-breaks.</b> Differences in plant diversity (species m- 2, species 20 m- 2) were slight. Surface soil of <b>fire-breaks</b> compared with grasslands was slightly more acidic (0. 2 units), lower in carbon (1 % difference), and lower in total nitrogen (0. 03 % difference), suggesting deterioration of soil conditions on <b>fire-breaks.</b> Phytomass of <b>fire-breaks</b> and of grasslands burnt in early spring in the season sampled (biennial or greater burning frequency) were equivalent by February, indicating there has been no decline in productivity over time. Concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and copper in above-ground phytomass did not differ between <b>fire-breaks</b> and grasslands, although concentration of manganese tended to be greater in grassland. Expected seasonal trends, especially for nitrogen and phosphorus, were apparent. <b>Fire-breaks</b> therefore appear to be a sustainable management practice, in part because mid-winter burning allows sufficient recovery of canopy cover to mitigate against erosion by high intensity spring storms and the duration of grazing impact is alleviated by spring burning elsewhere. Grazing impact on <b>fire-breaks</b> may become more severe if grassland burning becomes more infrequent. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Computer simulations, or microworlds, {{have been}} used for {{studying}} various topics including problem solving. This work investigates strategies for complex, dynamic problem solving in a fire-fighting microworld. Using data from a study by Canas, Antol, Fajardo & Salmern (2005), an ACT-R cognitive model is developed with the aim of providing insight into the development and selection of strategies participants use. One particular behavior observed in participants when trained repetitively on the same scenario, the creation of a <b>fire-break</b> barrier to prevent the fire spreading, is discussed. It was found that selection of a particular strategy depends on the fine-tuning of ACT-R production rule utilities as a consequence of environmental rewards, highlighting the role of reward size and timing. The model is able to capture various aspects of the data by promoting a free competition of small blocks of behavior based on rational analysis. A key finding is that good performance is linked to effective combination of strategic control with attention to changing task demands reflecting time and care taken in informing and effecting action...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{development}} work and practical {{use of chemical}} fire retardants for control of vegetation fires are described. Viscous water, prepared using sodium alginate solution, has proved highly successful for arresting flame spread {{in a variety of}} fuel types, including heather, grass, and gorse. Field-scale applications over a 5 -year period at more than 30 forests have shown that the technique can be used reliably and economically for controlled burning, and has also been used to contain wildfires. A satisfactory mixing/dispensing unit has been developed for mixing and applying viscous water. This unit is light and versatile and {{can be used as a}} general purpose pump or sprayer for water, herbicides, etc., if required. Extension of earlier trials using herbicides to dry grass vegetation to permit safe and rapid controlled burning during the 'green ' season has confirmed the initial promise. Paraquat has proved the most effective herbicide for this purpose, and can be used to considerable practical advantage for <b>fire-break</b> formation in grass, and particularly Molinia vegetation, providing grazing animals can be excluded for at least 24 hours after spraying. Recommendations are made on practical use of both these methods. I...|$|E

50|$|Crimson rosellas {{are common}} in coastal and {{mountain}} forests at all altitudes. They primarily live in forests and woodlands, preferring older and wetter forests. They {{can be found in}} tropical, subtropical, and temperate rainforests, both wet and dry sclerophyllous forests, riparian forests, and woodlands, all the way from sea level up to the tree line. They will also live in human-affected areas such as farmlands, pastures, <b>fire-breaks,</b> parks, reserves, gardens, and golf-courses. They are rarely found in treeless areas. At night, they roost on high tree branches.|$|R
50|$|Thomsons Lake Nature Reserve, {{including}} {{the lake and}} adjacent woodland, has an area of 538 ha. The lake is a shallow, brackish, seasonal lake with a large area of open water when full. It has extensive fringing sedgeland typical of the Swan Coastal Plain, and is a major breeding site, migration stop-over and semi-permanent drought refuge area for waterbirds. It usually dries out during the summer, though occasionally retaining some water through the year. It is fenced to exclude feral predators. It is mainly used for birdwatching, nature walks, and general recreation by surrounding residents. Within the reserve there is a network of <b>fire-breaks</b> and management access tracks used for bushwalking, while horse riding is only allowed on a perimeter track outside the vermin-proof fence.|$|R
40|$|This study {{accomplished}} an expedite rising of {{the native}} forest fragments scattered among Eucalyptus spp plantations in a forest property in order to characterize and to identify the critical points {{to which they are}} subject, to propose management actions envisaging their reclamation and conservation and to propose landscape management actions. The study was developed in São Jorge farm located in Paraopeba- MG- county. All fragments were analyzed to collect the following information: vegetation type, area, soil type, water collection occurrence, forms, neighborhood type, topography, <b>fire-break</b> conservation, height of the canopy, succession stage, presence of domestic and wild animals, more common tree species, altitude, disturbances and isolation degree. Covering maps, tables, indexes that allowed to analyze the characteristics of the fragments and to prescribe the landscape management were constructed. It concluded that: in the studied landscape the area with native forest covering is superior to the minimum required by law. However, if fragments are subject to border effect of 50 m, two of them can be extinguished along time. The action of turning the area with native vegetation of the property into a Preservation Area doesn't guarantee its maintenance along time. It is necessary to establish appropriate management techniques to soften the border effect, mainly for the smaller fragments. To protect the smaller fragments of the entropic action and of the border effect it is necessary to promote environmental education, to totally restrict the presence of domestic animals in the area, to implement corridors with vegetation, and to increase the size of the fragments. Managing the landscape correctly the property area with native vegetation will increase from 23, 13 % to 41, 46 % and the area with vegetation under border effect will fall from 49, 6 % to 26, 2 %...|$|E
40|$|Wildland fire {{propagation}} is {{studied in}} the literature by two alternative approaches, namely the reaction–diffusion equation and the level-set method. These two approaches are considered alternatives to each other because {{the solution of the}} reaction–diffusion equation is generally a continuous smooth function that has an exponential decay, and it is not zero in an infinite domain, while the level-set method, which is a front tracking technique, generates a sharp function that is not zero inside a compact domain. However, these two approaches can indeed be considered complementary and reconciled. Turbulent hot-air transport and fire spotting are phenomena with a random nature and they are extremely important in wildland fire propagation. Consequently, the fire front gets a random character, too; hence, a tracking method for random fronts is needed. In particular, the level-set contour is randomised here according to the probability density function of the interface particle displacement. Actually, when the level-set method is developed for tracking a front interface with a random motion, the resulting averaged process emerges to be governed by an evolution equation of the reaction–diffusion type. In this reconciled approach, the rate of spread of the fire keeps the same key and characterising role that is typical of the level-set approach. The resulting model emerges to be suitable for simulating effects due to turbulent convection, such as fire flank and backing fire, the faster fire spread being because of the actions by hot-air pre-heating and by ember landing, and also due to the fire overcoming a <b>fire-break</b> zone, which is a case not resolved by models based on the level-set method. Moreover, from the proposed formulation, a correction follows for the formula of the rate of spread which is due to the mean jump length of firebrands in the downwind direction for the leeward sector of the fireline contour. The presented study constitutes a proof of concept, {{and it needs to be}} subjected to a future validation...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} design {{did not include}} an open courtyard, instead the second level was entirely covered by a roof. The ground and first levels had two two-storey high passageways which extended from Derby Street and Quay Lane and met at right angles, separating the south- western {{corner of the building}} {{from the rest of the}} structure. During the fire the passageways acted as <b>fire-breaks</b> preventing the destruction of that section of the building. The fire was said to have descended to the lower levels through a lift-well [...] "at one end of the building in Quay Street" [...] indicating the position of a lift near the Quay Street frontage. The rapid spread of the fire through the second level was attributed to the open planning of the floor which was most likely changed in the reconstruction of the interior of the building to increase resistance to fire damage. The installation of the courtyard could have occurred after the 1912 fire, although, apparently there was another fire in 1918 which also gutted the building requiring internal reconstruction. However the description of the building in 1912 indicates the courtyard was not an original component of the building. The description also referred to the [...] "charred smoking beams" [...] indicating the typical use of timber inside the original warehouse.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although native herbivores {{can alter}} fire regimes by {{consuming}} herbaceous vegetation {{that serves as}} fine fuel and, less commonly, accumulating fuel as nest material and other structures, simultaneous considerations of contrasting effects of herbivores on fire have scarcely been addressed. We proposed that a colonial rodent, viz-cacha (Lagostomus maximus), reduces and increases fire intensity at different stages in its population cycle in the semiarid scrub of Argentina. Specifically, we hypothesized that, when colonies are active, vizcachas create natural <b>fire-breaks</b> through intense grazing, generating over time pat-ches of large unburned shrubs in grazed zones. In contrast, when colonies are abandoned, recovery of fine fuels and previous accumulation of coarse wood on colonies during territorial displays increases fire intensity, creating patches of high shrub mortality. To test these hypotheses, we estimated stem age of the dominant shrub (Larrea divari-cata) and measured aboveground biomass in zones actively grazed by vizcachas and in ungrazed zones, and compared densities of live and dead shrubs on abandoned colonies and adjacent zones following fire. In active colonies, age and biomass of shrubs were much greater in grazed than ungrazed zones. In abandoned colonies that had been burnt, density of dead, burned shrubs was higher and density of live shrubs was lower than in adjacent zones. These results support our hypotheses and reveal a new interaction between native herbivores and fire, in which herbivores augment fire intensity by gathering fuel. Our findings indicate that, through opposing effects on fire, native her-bivores enhance the heterogeneity of vegetation in woody-dominated ecosystems...|$|R
