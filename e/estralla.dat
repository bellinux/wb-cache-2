5000|$|Since 1979, the City of Phoenix {{has been}} divided into urban villages, {{many of which}} are based upon {{historically}} significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix. [...] Each village has a planning committee that is appointed directly by the city council. According to the village planning handbook issued by the city, the purpose of the village planning committees is to [...] "work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages." [...] There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, Alhambra, Camelback East, Central City, Deer Valley, Desert View, Encanto, <b>Estralla,</b> Laveen, Maryvale, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, Rio Vista, and South Mountain.|$|E
