5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{not saying}} the whole {{audience}} {{gave us a}} standing ovation, but there was this sizable standing ovation there.

Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a special}} case of the {{standard}} form where A = 1 and B = 0. The graph is a vertical line with x-intercept equal to a. The slope is undefined. There is no y-intercept, unless a = 0, {{in which case the}} graph of the line is the y-axis, and so every real number is a y-intercept. This is the only type of straight line which is not the graph of a function (<b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> fails the vertical line test).|$|E
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. <b>It</b> <b>obviously</b> wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, the U.S. {{military}} tested its forward air control capabilities per FM 31–35 during several joint field maneuvers involving the Army and Air Force. During the maneuvers, radios used for coordinating air action were unreliable; radio nets were overwhelmed with traffic. When the controllers could be contacted, they often had no targets to offer. When they did, they struggled to handle {{more than a}} single flight at a time. The early jet aircraft used for close air support had a voracious appetite for fuel, a short radii of action, and a short linger time over target. The joint Army/Air Force FAC effort results compared poorly to the U.S. Marines' organic system; <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> needed drastic improvement.|$|E
500|$|According to Ohlin (op. cit., p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> does not do that. How, then, is {{the height of the}} interest rate determined. The answer is that {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E

He stated that [...] "The {{showdown}} at Five Corners played out just like 'Cape Feare,' complete with rake gag, {{which is not a}} bad thing. If The Simpsons intends to self-plagiarize (and <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> does), that's a good episode to copy." [...] Sharon Knolle of AOL TV said, [...] "I'd say overall this ep ranks with some of the better Sideshow Bob eps, if not the very best.

500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E
500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He {{is a little bit of}} an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through <b>it,</b> <b>obviously</b> enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau of The Village Voice {{observed}} [...] "more bounce-to-the-ounce {{and less}} molasses in the jams, more delight and less braggadocio in the raps", and opined that Big Boi and André 3000's [...] "realism and high spirits drive each other higher". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker wrote that [...] "Stankonia reeks of artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill" [...] and described OutKast as [...] "endlessly good-humored and imaginative even {{when dealing with}} the most grim and mind-deadening facets of ghetto life." [...] Yahoo! Music's Soren Baker commented that [...] "Dre and Big Boi again reinvent themselves, this time as Parliament-inspired musicians who specialize on male-female relationships, boasting, and out-there lyrics." [...] Baker concluded in his review, [...] "With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their {{reputation as one of}} the best hip-hop groups of all time." [...] The Los Angeles Times opined that [...] "the record's most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds." [...] URB called the album [...] "a complex tome that enmeshes contemporary hip-hop values with a timeless Southern soul, while pushing the envelope damn near off the table." [...] Mojo called it [...] "hip hop with the power to convert even the most reactionary nonbelievers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Crypt {{sessions}} {{have been}} issued many times, twice in the 1980s as a double LP, {{and it is still}} available (with extra material, billed as [...] "The Complete Sessions") on a double CD from Matchless Recordings. The Crypt continues to inspire adventurous listeners; in the liner notes to the 1992 double CD, Prévost writes, [...] "Despite being (arguably) the most 'difficult' material on Matchless, The Crypt has been a mainstay for the label. <b>It</b> <b>obviously</b> pays not to underestimate the audience. Its continued success has enabled us to release other works. So we felt committed, obliged almost, to keep it available... this music has proved itself not to be ephemeral." ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, the {{two step}} {{process in the}} {{classical}} theory of solving the constraints [...] (equivalent to solving the admissibility conditions for the initial data) and looking for the gauge orbits (solving the 'evolution' equations) {{is replaced by a}} one step process in the quantum theory, namely looking for solutions [...] of the quantum equations [...] This is because <b>it</b> <b>obviously</b> solves the constraint at the quantum level and it simultaneously looks for states that are gauge invariant because [...] is the quantum generator of gauge transformations (gauge invariant functions are constant along the gauge orbits and thus characterize them). Recall that, at the classical level, solving the admissibility conditions and evolution equations was equivalent to solving all of Einstein's field equations, this underlines the central role of the quantum constraint equations in canonical quantum gravity.|$|E
