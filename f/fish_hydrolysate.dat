Aim To examine whether the partially hydrolysed and dried product of pacific whiting fish influenced the small intestinal damaging side effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin. Methods Eight human volunteers completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol of clinically relevant dose of indomethacin (50 mg t. d. s. p. o. for 5 days) with 7 days of <b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> or placebo starting 2 days prior to indomethacin.

40|$|PepT 1 (Peptide Transporter 1, SLC 15 A 1) is a proton-coupled peptide {{transporter}} {{responsible for}} uptake of short peptides and peptide-like drugs from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes. A PepT 1 -type transporter {{has recently been}} sequenced for Atlantic cod and found to be expressed along the whole post-gastric intestine including pyloric caeca. In the present thesis the effect of dietary inclusion of peptides and amino acids on expression of PepT 1 mRNA in different regions of juvenile Atlantic cod intestine was investigated. Five groups of cod weighing 10 - 15 grams were fed for 46 days with a diet containing approximately 42 % crude protein, either as fishmeal (FM diet) or 30 % of the fish meal substituted by either whole <b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> (FH diet), retenate after ultra filtration of <b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> (UFR diet), retenate after nano filtration of <b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> (NFR diet) or a mix of free amino acids (FAA diet). After 14 days (T 1) {{and at the end}} of the experiment (46 days; T 3), three fish were sampled from each group and the intestine divided into five segments, namely pyloric caeca (S 1) and the remainder of the intestine from the pyloric caeca to the anus divided into four equally long segments (S 2 to S 5). Total RNA isolated from each segment was subjected to a two-step quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR green and Atlantic cod elongation factor 1 alpha as reference gene. For all diets PepT 1 was found to be expressed in all segments, suggesting that for juvenile Atlantic cod the whole intestine is involved in peptide absorption. The different groups of fish showed a similar PepT 1 mRNA expression in all segments, but differences in regional expression were found. At T 3 the regional expression profile showed statistical differences in PepT 1 expression between segments in the FAA and UFR fed fish (diets included amino acids or larger sized peptides). Both groups had a higher expression in S 2 and S 3 (mid intestine) then pyloric caeca (S 1) and S 5. A similar trend was also observed for the UFR at T 1, while the FAA fed fish had a low and stable expression in all segments at T 1. No significant differences in PepT 1 expression were found between segments in the FM, FH or the NFR fed group for any time. These results suggest that for diets where 30 % of the fish meal has been replaced by <b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> containing short peptides (FH and NFR) the involvement of the pyloric caeca in peptide absorption is similar to the remainder of the intestine, while diets with no or low amounts of short chained peptides included (FAA and UFR) have a lower involvement of pyloric caeca in peptide absorption compared to mid intestine. A general higher expression of PepT 1 was found at T 3 then at T 1 in all segments except S 4, but no interaction between time and diet was found, indicating that some developmental or growth related changes in PepT 1 expression occurs during this life stage of Atlantic cod. These results suggest that dietary peptides of various chain lengths as well as free amino acids affect the regional expression of PepT 1 mRNA in the intestine of juvenile Atlantic cod. The signaling pathways responsible for PepT 1 regulation still remains to be described...|$|E

However, DBM developed faster on plants in the August experiment (high light), compared to the July experiment (lower light). This implies that light intensity may not be affecting DBM through plant-mediated changes unless reduced male weights confer a reduction in larval consumption. In the nitrogen source study, application of an organic source of nitrogen (<b>fish</b> <b>hydrolysate</b> fertilizer) was compared to a conventional fertilizer to determine whether nitrogen source directly impacts pac choi chemistry and biomass, thus indirectly impacting DBM fitness. In two experiments, there was no significant effect of fertility treatment on pac choi nutrients or biomass, with the exception of percent leaf phosphorus, which was significantly higher in the conventional fertility treatment. For DBM, percent survival and cohort development were significantly reduced on pac choi receiving the organic fertilizer. Calcium and magnesium were significantly higher in pac choi infested with DBM larvae than plants without DBM. In addition, calcium was negatively correlated with female DBM body weights in one experiment for the organic treatment. Overall, this study demonstrated that pac choi plants that received the organic fertilizer were similar to pac choi plants that received a conventional fertilizer with the exception of phosphorus.

The isolates FSAP 3 - 3 (Pediococcus pentosaceus), FSBP 4 - 40 (Pediococcus pentosaceus), FSBP 16 - 40 (Pediococcus pentosaceus), and FSBP 28 - 50 (Pediococcus acidilactici) showed both halotolerant and proteolytic properties. The identified LAB isolates showed antagonistic properties against several human pathogens and exhibited sensitivity toward a broad spectrum of antibiotics. All the identified LAB isolates showed excellent proteolytic activity and phosphohydrolase activity. These halotolerant LAB isolates that had both proteolytic properties and acidifying ability have the potential for application in an acceleration of fermentation to produce salted fish products (i. e., fish sauce, fish paste, fish mince, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} prepare <b>fish</b> protein <b>hydrolysate</b> from {{miscellaneous}} <b>fish</b> obtained as by catch from shrimp trawlers is outlined. Effect of temperature and concentration of enzyme papain on the yield of hydrolysates has been determined. It is seen that within 30 min at 55 °C and pH 6. 5 fish proteins can be effectively solubilized, provided the nitrogen {{content of the}} enzyme (activity 10 units/mg enzyme) and substrate are maintained in the ratio 1 : 30. This hydrolysate possesses the best amino acid pattern compared to those obtained after hydrolysis for 60 to 180 min...|$|R
30|$|After 2 [*]h of hydrolysis, the {{reaction}} mixtures were heated for 10 [*]min {{in boiling water}} to terminate the hydrolytic reaction. The mixture was then centrifuged at 2, 000 [*]×[*]g at 4 °C for 10 [*]min. The supernatant obtained was lyophilized using a freeze-drier (Model DuratopTM lP/Dura DryTM lP, FTS® System, Inc., Stone Ridge, NY, USA). The lyophilized <b>fish</b> protein <b>hydrolysates</b> produced from mince and W-MR-Al were referred to as ‘FPHmince’ and ‘FPHW-MR-Al’, respectively. The resulting hydrolysates were subjected to color measurement and were fortified in low-fat milk.|$|R
40|$|Protein hydrolysates {{produced}} from different food sources exhibit therapeutic potential {{and can be}} used in the management of chronic diseases. This study was targeted to optimise the conditions for the hydrolysis of stone fish protein to produce antioxidant hydrolysates using central composite design (CCD) by response surface methodology (RSM). The stone fish protein was hydrolysed under the optimum predicted conditions defined by pH (6. 5), temperature (54 °C), E/S ratio (1. 5 %), and hydrolysis time (360 [*]min). The hydrolysates were then evaluated for 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) scavenging activity and ferrous ion- (Fe 2 +-) chelating activity. Results validation showed {{no significant difference between the}} experimental values of DPPH• scavenging activity (48. 94 %) and Fe 2 +-chelating activity (25. 12 %) obtained at 54. 62 % degree of hydrolysis (DH) compared to their corresponding predicted values of 49. 79 % and 24. 08 % at 53. 08 % DH, respectively. The hydrolysates demonstrated non-Newtonian behavior (n< 1) with stronger shear-thinning effect and higher viscosities at increasing concentration. Thus, RSM can be considered as a promising strategy to optimise the production of stone <b>fish</b> protein <b>hydrolysates</b> containing antioxidant peptides. It is hoped that this finding will enhance the potential of stone <b>fish</b> protein <b>hydrolysates</b> (SHs) as therapeutic bioactive ingredient in functional foods development...|$|R
