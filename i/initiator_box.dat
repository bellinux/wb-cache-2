40|$|TRF, TATA-box-binding protein-related factor; TSS, {{transcription}} start site Transcriptional {{regulation is}} pivotal for development and differentiation of organisms. Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) initiates {{at the core}} promoter. Core promoters, which encompass the transcription start site, may contain functional core promoter elements, such as the TATA <b>box,</b> <b>initiator,</b> TCT and downstream core promoter element. TRF 2 (TATA-box-binding protein-related factor 2) does not bind TATA box-containing promoters. Rather, it is recruited to core promoters via sequences other than the TATA box. We review the recent findings implicating TRF 2 as a basal transcription factor in the regulation of diverse biological processes and specialized transcriptional programs...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{revealed}} that TATA <b>boxes</b> and <b>initiator</b> sequences have a common anomalous mechanical property, i. e. they comprise distinctive flexible and rigid sequences {{when compared with the}} other parts of the promoter region. In the present study, using the flexibility parameters from two different models, we calculated the average flexibility profiles of 1004 human promoters that do not contain canonical promoter elements, such as a TATA <b>box,</b> <b>initiator</b> (Inr) sequence, downstream promoter element or a GC box, and those of 382 human promoters that contain the GC box only. Here, we show that they have a common characteristic mechanical property that is strikingly {{similar to those of the}} TATA box-containing or Inr-containing promoters. Their most interesting feature is that the TATA- or Inr-corresponding region lies in the several nucleotides around the transcription start site. We have also found that a dinucleotide step from − 1 to + 1 (transcription start site) has a slight tendency to adopt CA that is known to be flexible. We also demonstrate that certain synthetic DNA fragments designed to mimic the average mechanical property of these 1386 promoters can drive transcription. This distinctive mechanical property may be the hallmark of a promoter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{canonical}} core promoter elements {{consist of}} the TATA <b>box,</b> <b>initiator</b> (Inr), downstream core promoter element (DPE), TFIIB recognition element (BRE) and the newly-discovered motif 10 element (MTE). The motifs for these core promoter elements are highly degenerate, {{which tends to}} lead to a high false discovery rate when attempting to detect them in promoter sequences. Results In this study, we have performed the first analysis of these core promoter elements in orthologous mouse and human promoters with experimentally-supported transcription start sites. We have identified these various elements using a combination of positional weight matrices (PWMs) and the degree of conservation of orthologous mouse and human sequences – a procedure that significantly reduces the false positive rate of motif discovery. Our analysis of 9, 010 orthologous mouse-human promoter pairs revealed two combinations of three-way synergistic effects, TATA-Inr-MTE and BRE-Inr-MTE. The former has previously been putatively identified in human, but the latter represents a novel synergistic relationship. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that DNA sequence conservation can greatly improve the identification of functional core promoter elements in the human genome. The data also underscores the importance of synergistic occurrence of two or more core promoter elements. Furthermore, the sequence data and results presented here can help build better computational models for predicting the transcription start sites in the promoter regions, which {{remains one of the most}} challenging problems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Experimental {{investigation}} of transcription {{is still a}} very labor- and time-consuming process. Only a few transcription initiation scenarios have been studied in detail. The mechanism of interaction between basal machinery and promoter, in particular core promoter elements, is not known for the majority of identified promoters. In this study, we reveal various transcription initiation mechanisms by statistical analysis of 3393 nonredundant Drosophila promoters. Results Using Drosophila -specific position-weight matrices, we identified promoters containing TATA <b>box,</b> <b>Initiator,</b> Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), and Motif Ten Element (MTE), as well as core elements discovered in Human (TFIIB Recognition Element (BRE) and Downstream Core Element (DCE)). Promoters utilizing known synergetic combinations of two core elements (TATA_Inr, Inr_MTE, Inr_DPE, and DPE_MTE) were identified. We also establish the existence of promoters with potentially novel synergetic combinations: TATA_DPE and TATA_MTE. Our analysis revealed several motifs with the features of promoter elements, including possible novel core promoter element(s). Comparison of Human and Drosophila showed consistent percentages of promoters with TATA, Inr, DPE, and synergetic combinations thereof, as well as most of the same functional and mutual positions of the core elements. No statistical evidence of MTE utilization in Human was found. Distinct nucleosome positioning in particular promoter classes was revealed. Conclusion We present lists of promoters that potentially utilize the aforementioned elements/combinations. The number of these promoters is two orders of magnitude larger than the number of promoters in which transcription initiation was experimentally studied. The sequences are ready to be experimentally tested or used for further statistical analysis. The developed approach may be utilized for other species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pyruvate {{carboxylase}} (EC 6. 4. 1. 1) is a biotin-containing {{enzyme that}} {{plays an important}} role in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Here we report the structural organization of the rat pyruvate carboxylase gene, which spans over 40 kilobases and is composed of 19 coding exons and 4 5 '-untranslated region exons. From this data, it is clear that alternative splicing of the primary transcripts from two promoters is responsible for the occurrence of the multiple mRNA species previously reported (Jitrapakdee, S., Walker, M. E., and Wallace, J. C. (1996) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 223, 695 - 700). The proximal promoter, which is active in gluconeogenic and lipogenic tissues, contains no TATA or CAAT boxes but includes a sequence that is typical of a housekeeping <b>initiator</b> protein 1 <b>box</b> while the distal promoter contains three CAAT boxes and multiple Sp 1 binding sites. Several potential transcription factor binding sites are found in both promoters. A series of 5 '-nested deletion constructs of both promoters were fused to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently expressed in COS- 1 cells. The results show that the 153 and 187 base pairs, preceding the transcription start sites of the proximal and distal promoters, respectively, are required for basal transcription. Insulin selectively inhibits the expression of the proximal promoter-luciferase reporter gene by 50 % but not the distal promoter in COS- 1 cells, suggesting the presence of an insulin-responsive element in the proximal promoter. A half-maximal effect was found at approximately 1 nM insulin...|$|R

40|$|Using primer {{extension}} and 52 ̆ 7 RACE, we have mapped the 52 ̆ 7 {{end of the}} BRCA 1 gene and identified a new 52 ̆ 7 exon. Two distinct BRCA 1 transcripts differing by the first exons were found; these transcripts were generated by the alternative use of dual promoters and alternative splicing. The expression of the distinct transcripts was examined in four primary tissues (placenta, mammary gland, testis and thymus), six normal or cancer cell lines, four primary breast tumour tissues and four primary ovary tumour tissues. Both transcripts were detected in all the samples studied, with the exon 1 a transcript being the major expressed form in mammary gland and the exon 1 b transcript in placenta. This suggests that the two transcripts may be expressed in a tissue-specific fashion. The 52 ̆ 7 flanking regions of both BRCA 1 transcripts were analysed, neither contains a TATA <b>box.</b> <b>Initiator</b> elements, which have been proposed to mediate transcription in TATA-less promoters, were found at the transcription initiation sites. Transcription factor binding sites such as Sp 1, PEA 3, C/EBP, CREB, E 4 F 1 and Pu boxes were identified in the 52 ̆ 7 flanking regions of the exon la transcript, and Sp 1, NF-kB and PEA 3 binding sites in the 52 ̆ 7 flanking region of the exon 1 b transcript. The interactions of these DNA elements with trans-acting factors are likely to modulate the alternative use of the distinct transcription start sites and {{the expression of the}} BRCA 1 gene...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} that the CD 3 gamma gene is specifically targeted in some T cell diseases focused our attention {{on the need to}} identify and characterize the elusive elements involved in CD 3 gamma transcriptional control. In this study, we show that while the human CD 3 gamma and CD 3 delta genes are oriented head-to-head and separated by only 1. 6 kb, the CD 3 gamma gene is transcribed from an independent but weak, lymphoid-specific TATA-less proximal promoter. Using RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we demonstrate that a cluster of transcription initiation sites is present {{in the vicinity of the}} primary core promoter, and the major start site is situated in a classical initiator sequence. A GT box immediately upstream of the initiator binds Sp family proteins and the general transcription machinery, with the activity of these adjacent elements enhanced by the presence of a second GC box 10 nt further upstream. The primary core promoter is limited to a sequence that extends upstream to - 15 and contains the <b>initiator</b> and GT <b>box.</b> An identical GT box located approximately 50 nt from the initiator functions as a weak secondary core promoter and likely generates transcripts originating upstream from the + 1. Finally, we show that two previously identified NFAT motifs in the proximal promoter positively (NFATgamma(1)) or negatively (NFATgamma(1) and NFATgamma(2)) regulate expression of the human CD 3 gamma gene by their differential binding of NFATc 1 plus NF-kappaB p 50 or NFATc 2 containing complexes, respectively. These data elucidate some of the mechanisms controlling expression of the CD 3 gamma gene as a step toward furthering our understanding of how its transcription is targeted in human disease.

40|$|Four {{different}} histones (H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3, and H 4; two subunits each) {{constitute a}} histone octamer, around which DNA wraps to form histone-DNA complexes called nucleosomes. Amino acid residues in each histone are occasionally modified, resulting in several biological effects, including differential regulation of transcription. Core promoters that encompass the transcription start site have well-conserved DNA motifs, including the <b>initiator</b> (Inr), TATA <b>box,</b> and DPE, which are collectively called the core promoter elements (CPEs). In this study, we systematically studied the associations between the CPEs and histone modifications by integrating the Drosophila Core Promoter Database and time-series ChIP-seq data for histone modifications (H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 27 ac, and H 3 K 27 me 3) during development in Drosophila melanogaster via the modENCODE project. We classified 96 core promoters into four {{groups based on}} {{the presence or absence}} of the TATA box or DPE, calculated the histone modification ratio at the core promoter region, and transcribed region for each core promoter. We found that the histone modifications in TATA-less groups were static during development and that the core promoters could be clearly divided into three types: i) core promoters with continuous active marks (H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 ac), ii) core promoters with a continuous inactive mark (H 3 K 27 me 3) and occasional active marks, and iii) core promoters with occasional histone modifications. Linear regression analysis and non-linear regression by random forest showed that the TATA-containing groups included core promoters without histone modifications, for which the measured RNA expression values were not predictable accurately from the histone modification status. DPE-containing groups had a higher relative frequency of H 3 K 27 me 3 in both the core promoter region and transcribed region. In summary, our analysis showed that there was a systematic link between the existence of the CPEs and the dynamics, frequency and influence on transcriptional activity of histone modifications...|$|R
