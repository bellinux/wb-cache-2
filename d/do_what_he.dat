5|$|The Japanese embassy {{met with}} King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King {{a letter from}} Date Masamune, as well as offer for a treaty. The King responded that he would <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to {{accommodate}} these requests.|$|E
5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 hours. He was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind {{the rest of his}} group, but he made a successful solo trip on 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. The flight was not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E

60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently {{why he was}} going to the station, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> was <b>doing,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> had <b>done,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought {{he was going to}} do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1229, Alice {{arrived in}} Acre, whereupon she laid {{claim to the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad, son of her niece, Isabella II, and Frederick. She {{appeared}} before the High Court of Jerusalem declaring that Conrad had forfeited his right to the kingdom as {{he had failed to}} personally take possession of it within a year and a day of the death of his mother, as required by a local law regarding fiefs inherited by a non resident heir. The members of the High Court, who had recently pledged fealty to Conrad's father, rejected Alice's claim, emphasizing that Conrad was a minor. However, they sent their envoys to Frederick in Foggia, Italy, requesting that he send Conrad to the Holy Land within a year and a day. Frederick informed the envoys that he would <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought best in May 1230.|$|E
5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E

And this was the origin of the Salesian Congregation. Among the first members were Michael Rua, John Cagliero (who later became a Cardinal), and John Baptist Francesia.|$|E
25|$|The Depression {{following}} {{the stock market}} crash of 1929 made it difficult for Mestler to obtain employment, and this he took as a sign that the time had come for him to give up his architectural career, for which he never cared, and to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had always longed to do by exclusively devoting himself to art.|$|E

Due to having tricked the Chandlers {{out of their}} fortune, Zach is able to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants with Chandler Enterprises. He names Josh as Chandler Enterprises' new boss. But when Adam Chandler regains control of Chandler Enterprises, Josh becomes the former CEO of the company.|$|E

Abdullah proceeded for two days, then he opened the letter; it told him to proceed until he reached Nakhla, between Mecca and Taif, to lie in wait for the Quraysh, and to observe what they were doing.|$|E
25|$|Alexander {{often had}} to divide his forces and command was given {{to a variety of}} senior {{officers}} on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have done himself without needing instructions.|$|E
25|$|In August, Canaris {{met with}} Franco's brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, {{who was about}} to become Spain's Foreign Minister. Canaris urged Serrano Súñer to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to {{convince}} Franco {{to stay out of the}} war. Soon after, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler's attitude, since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press very hard for Spanish involvement in the war, perhaps because he planned to meet Franco himself very soon.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, at {{the behest}} of Winston Churchill, Lydia {{infiltrated}} and eliminated a German Templar spy facility in Tower Bridge. She later sought out, on his request, {{the rest of the group}} and their Sage leader that he deemed to be a pressing matter of national security which he was unable to broach with the government as he lacked strong enough evidence. In exchange for her services, Churchill promised Lydia that he would <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could for the enfranchisement of women when he had returned to parliament after the War.|$|E
25|$|Samuel: {{a wealthy}} Jewish merchant. He {{made a deal}} with some Gentiles that he would give Azriel's bones to them to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> pleased if they would bring his daughters to safety. Whether Azriel truly loved him in the end or not is a matter of debate, because the scene begins with Azriel begging Samuel to fly him away from the {{oncoming}} pogrom, but ends on a sad note with Azriel being forced back into the bones cursing his master for being a martyr. This begins Azriel's onslaught of all his subsequent masters.|$|E
25|$|His last {{large-scale}} {{work of the}} 1930s was his Piano Concerto, composed for {{the pianist}} Solomon, who gave the world premiere at the World's Fair in New York in June 1939. Bliss and his family attended the performance and then stayed on in the US for a holiday. While they were there, the Second World War broke out. Bliss initially stayed in America, teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. He felt impelled to return to England to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could for the war effort, and in 1941, leaving {{his wife and children}} in California, he made the hazardous Atlantic crossing.|$|E

25|$|Hoover was {{by nature}} an activist and {{attempted}} to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the Depression, but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government. The Depression cost Hoover the presidency with the 1932 landslide election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition controlled American politics {{for most of the}} next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican Dwight Eisenhower. The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections, giving them congressional parity (though not control) {{for the first time since}} Woodrow Wilson's presidency.|$|E
25|$|Serving as aide-de-camp to the Chief of Operations of the Barrayaran Imperial Service, Captain Ivan Vorpatril reluctantly lets Imperial Security agent Byerly Vorrutyer (with {{whom he had}} uncomfortable {{dealings}} in A Civil Campaign) {{into his}} flat late one night. Byerly shows Ivan a photo of Tej, a young, attractive woman who is connected somehow with the subjects of his current undercover investigation. By believes that his subjects' interest in the young woman is not friendly, and asks Ivan to strike up an acquaintance with the woman {{to find out what}} she is up to, and possibly to supply some protection.

This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E
