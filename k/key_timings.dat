40|$|Experiments at {{two sites}} growing winter wheat {{show that in}} order to manage a wheat canopy more effectively, the use of {{specific}} remote sensing techniques both to monitor crop canopy expansion, and to determine variable nitrogen applications at <b>key</b> <b>timings</b> is required. Variations in seed rate were used to achieve a range of initial crop structures, and treatments were compared to standard farm practice. In the first year, the effect of varying seed rate (250, 350 and 450 seeds m- 2) on crop structure, yield components and grain yield, was compared to the effects of underlying spatial variation. Plant populations increased up to the highest rate, but shoot and ear populations peaked at 350 seeds m- 2. Compensation through an increased number of grains per ear and thousand grain weight resulted in the highest yield and gross margin at the lowest seed rate. In later experiments, the range of seed rates was extended to include 150 seeds m- 2, each sown in 24 m wide strips split into 12 m wide halves. One half received a standard nitrogen dose of 200 kg [N] ha- 1, the other a variable treatment based on near ‘real-time ’ maps of crop growth. Both were split into three applications, targeted at mid-late tillering (early March), growth stages GS 30 - 31 (mid April) and GS 33 (mid May).

Chalcopyrite mineralization occurs in syndeformational sulfide breccias, syntectonic veins, and massive and disseminated replacement ofdolomitic and pyritic host rocks.

40|$|Designers often cite {{unfamiliar}} notation as one {{obstacle to}} wider acceptance of formal methods. Formalizations of design notations, such as timing diagrams, promise {{to bridge the}} gap between design practice and formal methods. How to use such formalizations effectively, however, remains an open question. Developing new tools around design notations might provide better support for reasoning at the level of the preferred notations. On the other hand, translating the formalizations into established notations enables leveraging off of existing tools. This decision of whether to treat design notations as interfaces depends largely on computational tradeoffs. This paper explores this issue in the context of specifying properties for automata-theoretic verification using timing diagrams. Automata-theoretic algorithms perform a tableau construction to convert properties into Büchi automata. We contrast direct compilation of timing diagrams into Büchi automata with an approach that uses linear-time temporal logic (LTL) as an intermediate language during translation. Direct compilation generally produces much smaller automata and scales signi cantly better with variations in <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> diagram parameters. We attribute this to combination of a correspondence between timing diagrams and weak automata and certain shortcomings in current LTL-to-Büchi algorithms...|$|R

It was hypothesized that the key magnitude parameters would be significantly higher in the pros than the amateurs, and that the <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> parameters would be significantly different between the two groups. A representative swing from each of 19 amateurs and 19 pros was captured using three-dimensional (3 D) motion analysis techniques. Eighteen key kinematic sequence performance variables that occur during the downswing were computed from the data. Student t-test’s were used to compare the group means for each parameter with an experiment-wise level of significance set at p< 0. 2, and a corresponding test-wise significance of p< 0. 011. All the magnitude variables including rotational accelerations; rotational decelerations, (except pelvis); peak rotational speeds; rotational speed gains; and linear club head speed at impact, showed a significant difference between the amateurs and pros, with the pros having greater values in every case. Although the pelvis rotational deceleration did not show a significant difference between groups, every pro did show a slowing of the pelvis before impact; not so with the amateurs. The mean of the peak times showed no significant difference between the pros and amateurs, but the standard deviations of the means for the amateurs were at least double those for the pros in each case.

A model illustration for the association between impulsiveness and timing deficits is the impulsiveness disorder of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

40|$|Synchronizing {{movements}} with auditory beats, {{compared to}} visual flashes, yields divergent activation in timing-related brain {{areas as well}} as more stable tapping synchronization. The differences in timing-related brain activation could reflect differences in tapping synchronization stability, rather than differences between modality (i. e., audio-motor vs. visuo-motor integration). In the current fMRI study, participants synchronized their finger taps with four types of visual and auditory pacing sequences: flashes and a moving bar, as well as beeps and a frequency-modulated ‘siren’. Behavioral tapping results showed that visuo-motor synchronization improved with moving targets, whereas audio-motor synchronization degraded with frequency-modulated sirens. Consequently, a modality difference in synchronization occurred between the discrete beeps and flashes, but not between the novel continuous siren and moving bar. Imaging results showed that activation in the putamen, a <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> area, paralleled the behavioral results: putamen activation was highest for beeps, intermediate for the continuous siren and moving bar, and was lowest for the flashes. Putamen activation differed between modalities for beeps and flashes, but not for the novel moving bar and siren. By dissociating synchronization performance from modality, we show that activation in the basal ganglia is associated with sensorimotor synchronization stability rather than modality-specificity in this task. Synchronization stability is apparently contingent upon the modality's processing affinity: discrete auditory and moving visual signals are modality appropriate, and can be encoded reliably for integration with the motor system...|$|R

In this work, we employ information theoretic ideas to quantify the amount of leakage that can be extracted from runtime measurements and reveal the influence of individual key bits on the timing observations across a variety of hardware implementations.

Such a measurement device is useful to determine <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> and quantity parameters for injection system improvements to meet the evolving requirements of emissions, power and economy. This study aims to further the {{understanding of the nature of}} cavitation which could occur in the near nozzle region under these specific conditions of liquid into liquid injection using high pressure diesel injectors for heavy duty engines. The motivation for this work is to better understand the temporal signature of the pressure signals that arise in a typical injection cycle. A preliminary CFD study was performed, using OpenFOAM, with a transient (Large Eddy Simulation -LES), multiphase solver using the homogenous equilibrium model for the compressibility of the liquid/vapour. The nozzle body was modelled for simplicity without the nozzle needle using a nozzle hole of 200 μm diameter and the body pressurised to values typical for common rail engines. Temperature effects were neglected and the wall condition assumed to be adiabatic. The chamber initial static pressure was varied between 10 and 50 bar to reflect typical testing conditions. Results indicate that vapour formation could occur in areas 10 - 30 mm distant from the nozzle itself. The cavitation was initiated around 100 μs after the jet had started for low ΔP cases and followed the development period required for the formation of vortices associated with the vortex roll up of this jet. These vortices had localised sites, in their core region, below the vapour pressure and were convected downstream of their initial formation location. It was also found that vapour formation could occur at chamber static pressures up to 50 bar (the highest tested) due to cavitation in the shear layer and this vortex effect. The pressure signal received at the chamber would therefore be more difficult to interpret with additional error components...|$|R
40|$|Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{includes}} {{the processes of}} meiosis and spore formation. The genes involved in this developmental process are tightly regulated {{at the level of}} transcription to ensure that genes are expressed at the correct time and level. The co-ordinated expression of middle sporulation genes is mediated by a <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> promoter element called the middle sporulation element (MSE). While this element sets the timing of gene expression to middle sporulation, in some cases, the level of expression is mediated by cis-acting auxiliary promoter elements. This study has addressed the role that auxiliary transcription factors play in fine-tuning of timing and level of expression of the MSE-regulated middle sporulation genes SPS 18 and SPS 19 and the mid-late sporulation genes DIT 1 and DIT 2. The MSE*SPS 18 / 19 was shown previously to set the timing of expression of SPS 18 and SPS 19 to middle sporulation. In order to achieve the full level of meiotic activation, a novel bipartite auxiliary promoter element called the MAE (MSE-associated element) was required (Dalton, 2004). This study has revealed that proteins bind to specific regions of the MAE motif during sporulation in vitro and has attempted to isolate the proteins by affinity chromatography and identify them by mass spectrometry. The timing of expression of DIT 1 and DIT 2 during sporulation was of particular interest since two MSE-like elements had been identified in the promoter of the these genes (Hepworth et al., 1995). If these MSEs were functional, it was thought that auxiliary elements may delay expression of these genes until mid-late sporulation. This study has shown that the MSE*NRE confers a normal middle sporulation pattern of expression on a reporter gene. The DRE (DIT repressor element) previously identified by Bogengruber et al. (1998) was further characterised as an element that alters the level of expression conferred by an MSE without altering the timing. Several proteins were shown to bind to specific regions of the DIT promoter surrounding the DRE motif in vitro, with a different set of proteins binding during vegetative growth and sporulation. Attempts to isolate and identify these proteins by affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Meeting {{the timing}} {{requirements}} {{is an important}} constraint imposed on highly integrated circuits, and the verification of timing of a circuit before manufacturing {{is one of the}} critical tasks to be solved by CAD tools. In this paper, we present a novel technique to speed up gate-level timing simulation that is based on Structurally Synthesized Binary Decision Diagrams (SSBDD), which have already found application as an efficient mathematical model to represent digital circuits. The new approach uses path delays instead of gate delays for tree-like subcircuits (macros). Therefore timing waveforms are calculated not for all internal nodes of the gate-level circuit, but only for outputs of macros. The macros are represented by SSBDDs, which enable a fast computation of delays for macros. We show that the speed-up of timing simulation is directly proportional to the average size of macros in the circuit. The new approach to speed up the timing simulation is supported by encouraging experimental results. <b>Key</b> words: <b>timing</b> simulation, binary decision diagrams, delay modelling. 1...|$|R

40|$|Relatively recently, neurocognitive and neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have deficits in a range of timing functions and their underlying neural networks. Despite this evidence, timing deficits in ADHD are still somewhat neglected in the literature and mostly omitted from reviews on ADHD. There is therefore a lack of integrative reviews on the up-to-date evidence on neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits of timing in ADHD and their significance with respect to other behavioural and cognitive deficits. The present review provides a synthetic overview of the evidence for neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits in ADHD in timing functions, and integrates this evidence with the cognitive neuroscience literature of the neural substrates of timing. The review demonstrates that ADHD patients are consistently impaired in three major timing domains, in motor timing, perceptual timing and temporal foresight, comprising several timeframes spanning milliseconds, seconds, minutes and longer intervals up to years. The most consistent impairments in ADHD are found in sensorimotor synchronisation, duration discrimination, reproduction and delay discounting. These neurocognitive findings of timing deficits in ADHD are furthermore supported by functional neuroimaging studies that show dysfunctions in the key inferior fronto-striato-cerebellar and fronto-parietal networks that mediate the timing functions. Although there is evidence that these timing functions are inter-correlated with other executive functions that are well established to be impaired in the disorder, in particular working memory, attention, and to a lesser degree inhibitory control, the <b>key</b> <b>timing</b> deficits appear to survive when these functions are controlled for, suggesting independent cognitive deficits in the temporal domain. There is furthermore strong evidence for an association between timing deficits and behavioural measures of impulsiveness and inattention, suggesting that <b>timing</b> problems are <b>key</b> to the clinical behavioural profile of ADHD. Emerging evidence shows that the most common treatment of ADHD with the dopamine agonist and psychostimulant Methylphenidate attenuates most timing deficits in ADHD and normalises the abnormally blunted recruitment of the underlying fronto-striato-cerebellar networks. Timing function deficits in ADHD, therefore, next to executive function deficits, form an independent impairment domain, and should receive more attention in neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pharmacological basic research as well as in translational research aimed to develop pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment of abnormal timing behaviour and cognition in ADHD.
