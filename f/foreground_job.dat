The FB, XM and ZM monitors also provided a <b>foreground</b> <b>job,</b> as well as six system jobs if selected via the SYSGEN system generation program. These tasks had fixed priorities, with the background job lowest and the <b>foreground</b> <b>job</b> highest. It was possible to switch between jobs from the system console user interface, and SYSGEN could generate a monitor that provided a single background job (the SB, XB and ZB variants).|$|E

We are developing the Combined Optimization Technique (COT) (Kozlov, Samsonov, 2003) for biological data fitting and perform the experiments {{in the context of}} one biological system namely the segment determination gene network of a fruit fly Drosophila embryo (Jaeger et al, 2004). In this work we introduce a new migration scheme for the Parallel Differential Evolution (DE) {{that is going to be}} used as an alternative for the Simulated Annealing (SA) at the first stage of COT. We present numerical results on optimization using the developed algorithm for the test problem of finding parameters in a network of two genes and the analysis of the dependency of the accuracy of the final result on the period of communication between branches. Differential Evolution is an iterative stochastic optimization technique that was invented at the end of the previous century by Storn and Price (Storn, Price, 1995) that operates on population of individuals that is the set of the parameter vectors. As any evolutionary algorithm, DE can be easily parallelized due to the fact that each member of the population is evaluated individually. The whole population is divided into subpopulations that are sometimes called islands or branches one per each computational node. The individual members of branches are then allowed to migrate, i. e. move...|$|E

This work is {{in addition to the}} regular tasks of the system and its purpose is to improve system reliability and availability. Nonetheless, additional work in the system, although labeled as best effort or low priority, still affects the performance of foreground tasks, especially if background/foreground work is non-preemptive. In this paper, we propose an analytic model to evaluate the performance trade-offs of the amount of background work that a storage system can sustain. The proposed model results in a quasi-birth-death (QBD) process that is analytically tractable. Detailed experimentation using a variety of workloads shows that under dependent arrivals both foreground and background performance strongly depends on system load. In contrast, if arrivals of <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs</b> are independent, performance sensitivity to load is reduced. The model identifies dependence in the arrivals of <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs</b> as an important characteristic that controls the decision of how much background load the system can accept to maintain high availability and performance gains.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{scheduling}} of jobs with a constraint {{on the average}} waiting time {{in the presence of}} background jobs. The objective is to schedule to s servers such that the throughput of the background traffic is maximized while satisfying the response time constraint on the foreground traffic. A typical application of this model is call blending in call centers. Here the servers are called agents, the foreground traffic are the incoming calls and the background traffic are the outgoing calls. The arrivals are determined by a Poisson process and the service times of the jobs are independent exponentially distributed. We consider both the situation where service requirements by both types of jobs are equal and unequal. The first situation is solved to optimality, for the second situation we find the best policy within a certain class of policies. Optimal schedules always keep part of the service capacity free for arriving <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs.</b> ...|$|R

In this paper, we discuss how to use the knowledge of temporal dependence in flows to forecast the length of idle intervals in storage systems. We design a new background scheduling policy to determine when and for how long idle times can be used for serving background tasks, without violating pre-defined performance targets of <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs.</b> Our analysis shows that if idle times have low variability, then {{it is not necessary to}} idle wait before starting a background job. Only if idle times are highly variable, then idle waiting is necessary to minimize the impact of background activity on foreground performance. We further show that if there is burstiness in addition to high variability in idle intervals, then it is possible to predict accurately the length of incoming idle times and use that information to serve more background <b>jobs</b> without affecting <b>foreground</b> performance. 1...|$|R

In this paper we present a new scheduling policy called Linger-Longer that exploits the fine-grained availability of workstations to run sequential and parallel jobs. We present a two-level workload characterization study {{and use it to}} simulate a cluster of workstations running our new policy. We compare two variations of our policy to two previous policies: ImmediateEviction and Pause-and-Migrate. Our study shows that the Linger-Longer policy can improve the throughput of foreign jobs on cluster by 60 % with only a 0. 5 % slowdown of <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs.</b> For parallel computing, we showed that the Linger-Longer policy outperforms reconfiguration strategies when the processor utilization by the local process is 20 % or less in both synthetic bulk synchronous and real data-parallel applications. 1.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. The authors {{analyze the}} spheres of general {{interests}} and collaboration between Ukraine and Russia and methodical bases of such collaboration and its instruments in the article. The analysis of dynamics of external trade turnover and commodity structure of export and import of Sumy region as displays of economic border-region collaboration of two states is carried out. Forecast models of Sumy region commodities and services external trade are built. Place and importance of economic collaboration of two states on principles of innovations are found out. The process of marketing of innovations {{and its role in}} providing effectiveness of border-region economic collaboration is characterized. The results of the analysis. Collaboration in economic sphere with Russia is one of <b>foreground</b> <b>jobs</b> of Ukraine. Both of the states remain largely mutually dependent from the resource and technological points of view, have the ramified network of multilateral economic connections, and aspire to the civilized integration in outer economic space. The features of global and national development need from Ukraine and Russia forming of the relations in a strategic prospect exactly on economic foundation, maximally using an interregional collaboration in which the special role is played by border-region territories first of all, carrying out the role of buffer between countries. The most developed and often used instrument of economic border-region collaboration between Russia and Ukraine are export-import operations. Sumy region is very dependent upon external economic relations, as basis of its GDP is made by export-import operations that are typical for border-region territory. The Russian Federation is the general economic partner of Sumy region, thus at the years its role grows only. On the whole, it is possible to draw to the conclusion about predominant export commodity orientation of Sumy region border collaboration with the countries of the UIS, in thereby with Russia. As the built prognosis testifies, the export of commodities will grow at the years, in particular the export of commodities will grow mainly to the countries of the UIS, in thereby to Russia. In relation to the import of commodities: its volume is less, by comparison to an export, but a tendency is expected to its increase. What touches a situation with the export of services, then its volume considerably is less (and more close connection is traced with the countries of the UIS, in thereby with Russia) than the volume of commodity operations, and a tendency to reduction of this index is expected. Speaking about efficiency of economic border-region collaboration of Sumy region with Russia and taking into account its substantial commodity export orientation (in particular in such categories of commodities, that suppose ability of realization of innovational potential and scientific-technical achievements in industries), {{it should be noted that}} all of these additionally actualizes an importance of problem of marketing of innovations in providing the efficiency of border-region economic collaboration and desirable effectiveness of commodity export operations with the innovation products. As an analysis of efficiency of economic border-region collaboration of Sumy region and Russia showed, it is mainly export oriented, in particular export of commodities of such basic groups as chemical industry and the industries related to it, mechanical equipment; machines and mechanisms, electronic equipment and its parts; devices. Conclusions and directions of further researches. Exactly in the production of these commodities realization of innovative potential of the state and increase of competitiveness of its commodities becomes possible at the foreign trade market. The effective events of marketing of such innovations must promote efficiency of Sumy region economic collaboration with border territories, in particular with Russia. It should be noted that such problems are present as:it is reduction of demand on products that present the principal items of mutual export and import as a result of braking of rates of the economy growing in both countries;it is the considerable rising in price of import as a result of high inflation and rapid devaluation of national currency, that is especially perceived in Ukraine;it is a risk of introduction from the side of Russian Federation government of additional access of the Ukrainian products restrictions to the Russian market with the aim to support a national economy in crisis terms. The prospect of further research is an efficiency of marketing events estimation during realization of economic collaboration of Sumy region with border territories...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{wireless}} {{networks are}} based {{on a wide range of}} different technologies providing overlapping coverage. This offers users a seamless integration of connectivity by allowing to switch between networks, and opens up a promising area for boosting the performance of wireless networks. Motivated by this, we consider a networking environment in which users are able to select between the available wireless networks to minimize the mean processing times for file downloads in the presence of background traffic. The information available to the user is only the total number of jobs in each network, rather than the per-network numbers of <b>foreground</b> and background <b>jobs.</b> This leads to a complex partial information decision problem which is the focus of this paper. We develop and evaluate a Bayesian learning algorithm that optimally splits a stream of jobs that minimizes the expected sojourn time. The algorithm learns as the system operates and provides information at each decision and departure epoch. We evaluate the optimality of the partial information algorithm by comparing the performance of the algorithm with the "ideal" performance obtained by solving a Markov decision problem with full state information. To this end, we have conducted extensive experiments both numerically and in a simulation testbed with the full wireless protocol stack. The results show that the Bayesian algorithm has close to optimal performance over a wide range of parameter values. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
