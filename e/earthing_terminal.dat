50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed conductive part of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main <b>earthing</b> <b>terminal.</b> The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s earth electrode (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|E

40|$|Protection against {{electric}} shock {{in our homes}} and work places {{is one of the}} most important priorities for electrical services engineers who are now designing electrical installations to conform to the requirements of the 17 th edition IEE Wiring Regulations (BS 7671 : 2008). Now Chapter 41 of BS 7671 : 2008 requires that additional protection by means of a 30 mA 40 ms residual current protection device be provided for final circuits supplying general purpose socket outlets that are intended for use by ‘Ordinary persons’. However, there are few publications and little information available on the theory describing how touch voltage of a dangerous magnitude could be transferred from a faulty circuit onto the exposed-conductive-parts of Class 1 equipment of another healthy circuit. This paper summarises the theory of transfer touch voltage calculations and expands on it to show how to carry out a sensitivity analysis in relation to the design parameters that are being used by designers and installers. Based on the results of a real case study, it appears that there is sufficient evidence to show that it may not be sufficiently safe to use the nominal external earth fault loop impedance quoted by the electricity utility companies for adopting a low touch voltage design. Practical application: The touch voltage sensitivity equation derived in this paper is a powerful tool for designers and installers of electrical installations to investigate and identify the sensitivity of resulting touch voltages of any electrical circuits.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in broadband satellite networks. Broadband satellite networks are designed to provide the required qualify of service (QoS) for multimedia applications while maximizing the bandwidth and power utilization efficiency of the satellite channel. They incorporate appropriate call admission control (CAC) process, policing mechanism, and medium access control schemes for regulating access to the satellite channel from multimedia <b>earth</b> <b>terminals.</b> This motivates the need for an appropriate buffer management to control the congestion at the <b>earth</b> <b>terminal</b> buffers so that the compliant traffic is ensured to receive its required QoS. In this paper, we propose a novel Head of Line Priority Cell Discard (HoL- PCD) buffer management mechanism at the <b>earth</b> <b>terminal</b> buffers, that preserves QoS for compliant traffic at the expense of non compliant traffic, and improves the overall delay performance of the network. Our simulation model includes a GEO satellite with onboard bandwidth scheduler, with multimedia <b>earth</b> <b>terminals</b> accessing the satellite by means of multiple frequency time division multiple access (MFTDMA) with combined free/demand assignment (CFDAMA). Results verify the effectiveness of the HoL-PCD scheme in increasing the amount of compliant traffic accommodated by the network while maintaining the QoS guarantees required by the users...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in the co-existence of geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) and non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) satellite networks is to mitigate the in-line interference caused by an NGSO satellite to the GSO <b>earth</b> <b>terminal,</b> while the NGSO satellite is crossing the GSO satellite's illumination zone. The method recommended in ITU-R S. 1325 - 3 involves utilizing a range-based power control on the NGSO satellite for downlink communication to the NGSO <b>earth</b> <b>terminals.</b> In this paper, we investigate a cognitive range-based power control algorithm while {{taking into account the}} imposed interference level to the GSO fixed satellite service (FSS) system.

More importantly, we formulate and solve an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the inter-site distance (ISD) of the GSO-NGSO earth user-terminals. Finally, we develop an analytical method to calculate the ISD between GSO and NGSO <b>earth</b> <b>terminals</b> and validate this with the help of simulation results...|$|R
