2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. [...] These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. [...] A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). [...] A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. [...] More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. [...] A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with <b>impact</b> <b>tools</b> varying in coarseness. [...] A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. [...] A thermal (or flamed) finish produces a textured, nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame. [...] This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{effect of}} <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> {{geometry}} and soft material covering on bone fracture patterns {{plays a major}} role in fracture patterns. However, the literature is nearly void of such studies and only general correlations between the fracture pattern and the mechanism underlying the insult were reported. Purpose The aim of this study is to reveal the association between the geometry of the <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> and the presence of soft material covering on bone fracture patterns. The Dynatup Model POE 2000 (Instron Co.) low energy pendulum impact machine was utilized to apply impact loading on fresh pig femoral bones (n = 50). The bone clamp shaft was adjusted to position the bone for three-point bending with additional bone compression simulating a situation occurring in pedestrian road traffic accidents. Five different tests using varying <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> sizes with and without soft interface covering were carried out. Results A significant positive correlation was found between the fracture features and the <b>impact</b> <b>tool’s</b> geometry. Only bones that were damaged by a rounded impact body result in a “false” butterfly fragment; in all other cases where the impact body is flat and wide, double trapezoid fragments are observed in the area of impact. The impacted aspect is the most affected. All fracture line features were significantly greater in bones subjected to an <b>impact</b> by <b>tools</b> without soft covering. With an impact with soft covering, the impacted aspect exhibits numerous unique fracture lines and a fragmented pattern. Our study clearly shows that <b>impact</b> <b>tool</b> geometry and soft material covering markedly affect the fracture pattern...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The ICLIPS {{model is}} an {{integrated}} assessment model {{of climate change}} that links global climate change with regional impacts and mitigation efforts by integrating components from different disciplines and various spatial scales. Its reduced–form impact module consists of climate impact response functions (CIRFs) that depict the regional sensitivity of selected climate–sensitive impact sectors to changes in important climatic and atmospheric drivers. In addition to enabling the specification of maximum “tolerable ” impacts of climate change in a tolerable windows analysis with the ICLIPS model, the CIRFs are also a valuable information source in their own right. In this paper, I present the ICLIPS <b>Impacts</b> <b>Tool,</b> a software tool that provides convenient access to a large number (ca. 100, 000) of CIRF diagrams {{for a wide range}} of impact indicators, geographical regions, and climate projections. The choice of Java as programming language enables the ICLIPS <b>Impacts</b> <b>Tool</b> to run on most computer platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris and AIX.

50|$|Sockets and {{extensions}} for impact wrenches {{are made}} of high tensile metal, as any spring effect will greatly reduce the torque available at the fastener. Even so, {{the use of multiple}} extensions, universal joints, and so forth will weaken the impacts, and the operator needs to minimize their use. Using non-impact sockets or accessories with an impact wrench will often result in bending, fracturing, or otherwise damaging the accessory, as most are not capable of withstanding the sudden high torque of an impact tool, and can result in stripping the head on the fastener. Non-impact sockets and accessories {{are made of}} a harder more brittle metal. Safety glasses should always be worn when working with <b>impact</b> <b>tools,</b> as the strong impacts can generate high-speed shrapnel if a socket, accessory, or fastener fails.|$|E
