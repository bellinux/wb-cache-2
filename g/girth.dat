5|$|Constructions of graphs {{with large}} values of {{chromatic}} number and <b>girth,</b> not just odd <b>girth,</b> are also possible, but more complicated (see <b>Girth</b> and graph coloring).|$|E
5|$|The odd <b>girth</b> is, equivalently, the {{smallest}} odd number g {{for which there}} exists a homomorphism from the cycle graph on g vertices to G. For this reason, if G → H, then the odd <b>girth</b> of G is {{greater than or equal}} to the odd <b>girth</b> of H.|$|E
5|$|For example, the Grötzsch graph is 4-chromatic and triangle-free (it has <b>girth</b> 4 and odd <b>girth</b> 5), {{so it is}} {{incomparable}} to {{the triangle}} graph K3.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{consider}} two related infinite families of graphs, which generalize the Petersen and the Coxeter graph. The main result proves that these graphs are cores. It is determined {{which of these}} graphs are vertex/edge/arc-transitive or distance-regular. <b>Girths</b> and odd <b>girths</b> are computed. A problem on hamiltonicity is posed...|$|R
5000|$|Ply-split {{braiding}} is {{an ancient}} art that is practiced for making elaborate camel <b>girths</b> and other animal regalia of hand-spun goat hair, wool or sometimes cotton in northwestern India. The first written description of the technique appeared in 1976 with Virginia Harvey's [...] "Split-Ply Twining". In the introduction, she describes seeing two camel <b>girths</b> at Convergence 1974, and says that Peter Collingwood [...] "suspected the pieces were produced by pulling one yarn through the ply of another". The ply-split <b>girths</b> examined for this publication were created with only one technique, now known as single course oblique twining (SCOT).|$|R

5|$|The Javan slow loris {{is larger}} than both of the other Indonesian slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris and the Bornean slow loris. Based on averages {{determined}} from six specimens obtained from the illegal wildlife trade in Java, other morphometric parameters are as follows: head length, 59.2mm; muzzle length, 19.9mm; head breadth, 43.6mm; body breadth, 250.8mm; head and body length, 293.1mm; chest <b>girth,</b> 190.8mm; dark percentage <b>girth</b> (<b>girth</b> measurement of zone with dark dorsal hair, measured {{as a percent of}} <b>girth</b> circumference), 48.0mm; neck circumference, 136.7mm; tail length, 20.4mm; humerus length, 67.2mm; radius length, 71.8mm; femur length, 83.2mm; tibia length, 85.9mm; hand span, 59.1mm; foot span, 70.3mm; and ear length, 16.8mm.|$|E
5|$|The duality between Eulerian and bipartite planar graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite. The two dual concepts of <b>girth</b> and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the <b>girth</b> of the graphic matroid of a planar graph {{is the same as the}} graph's <b>girth,</b> and the <b>girth</b> of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E
5|$|Examples of graphs with {{arbitrarily}} large {{values of}} odd <b>girth</b> and chromatic number are Kneser graphs and generalized Mycielskians.|$|E

5|$|One way to {{construct}} {{them is to}} consider the odd <b>girth</b> of a graph G, the length of its shortest odd-length cycle.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, if G has {{strictly}} larger odd <b>girth</b> than H and strictly larger chromatic number than H, then G and H are incomparable.|$|E
5|$|Chantenay carrots. Although {{the roots}} are shorter than other cultivars, they have {{vigorous}} foliage and greater <b>girth,</b> being broad in {{the shoulders and}} tapering towards a blunt, rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Art Institute Board met the {{day after}} the {{incident}} and agreed not to display Mirth & <b>Girth</b> any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers. After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample <b>girth,</b> long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Under this {{sycamore}} tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, {{known as}} the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. They {{were found to have}} breached the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a <b>girth</b> of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his <b>girth</b> was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or <b>girth</b> around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan {{in a final}} frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and <b>girth</b> of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's <b>girth</b> expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} and compare kinanthropometric characteristics of elite young kayakers and canoeists and to compare their proportionality with Olympic paddlers. One hundred and twenty young elite sprint paddlers (66 kayakers and 58 canoeists), aged 13 - and 14 -years-old, were assessed using a battery of 32 anthropometric dimensions. Somatotypes, Phantom Z-scores and corrected <b>girths</b> were calculated. Comparison between kayakers and canoeists showed that kayakers had greater height, body weight, sitting height, arm span and upper body lengths, breadths and <b>girths</b> than canoeists. Higher proportional humerus breadth and arm <b>girths</b> were also found in kayakers. However, canoeists had higher Z-scores in femur breadth. Olympic paddlers had higher proportional dimensions in upper body <b>girths,</b> and biacromial breadth in both disciplines. Mean somatotypes of kayakers were best described as balanced mesomorphs, while canoeists were ecto-mesomorphs. Differences between kayak and canoe paddlers may be explained by the continual need for physical development in kayakers, in order to remain competitive, compared to the young canoeists’ need to place much greater emphasis on the development of their technical ability. The data provided in this study {{could be used as a}} guideline for talent identifi cation in sprint canoeing and kayaking...|$|R
