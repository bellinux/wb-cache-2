5000|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} <b>Interim</b> <b>decreed</b> by Charles V at the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the insurgents {{were full of}} {{resolution}} to defend Protestantism and-not least-their autonomy against the Imperial central authority. They agreed to establish contacts with the Catholic French king Henry II, disregarding his oppression of the Protestant Huguenots. In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V and prepared to march against the Empire up to the Rhine River. On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies, whereby the French conquests were legitimised ahead of time. The princes acknowledged the king's lordship as [...] "Vicar of the Empire" [...] over the Imperial cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun, as well as Cambrai [...] "and other towns of the Empire that do not speak German". The insurgents in turn received subsidies and military assistance from the French, their troops moved into the Habsburg hereditary lands and laid siege to the emperor at Innsbruck, while his brother Ferdinand I entered into negotiations {{that led to the}} revocation of the Augsburg Interim by the 1552 Peace of Passau.Backed by Duke Francis of Guise and his brother Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, King Henry II of France upon his agreement with the Protestant princes had started his Voyage d’Allemagne [...] "for the sake of German liberties". On Palm Sunday 1552 French troops under the command of Anne de Montmorency in a surprise attack moved into the walls of Metz, followed by the occupation of Toul on 13 April. Henry then turned against the Lorraine capital Nancy, where he had the minor duke Charles III abducted to the French court in Paris. On 18 April the king celebrated his entry into Metz and, after a failed attack on the Imperial City of Strasbourg, returned from the Rhine to move into Verdun on 12 June. At that time, the French had occupied the three Imperial cities as well as the territory of the surrounding Prince-bishoprics.|$|R

Spain, by Decree of the Pope,--some Pope long ago, whose name we will not remember, in solemn Conclave, drawing {{accurately}} 'his Meridian Line,' on I know not what Telluric or Uranic principles, no doubt with great accuracy 'between Portugal and Spain,'--was proprietor of all those Seas and Continents. And now England, in the <b>interim,</b> by <b>Decree</b> of the Eternal Destinies, had clearly come to have property there, too; and to be practically much concerned in that theoretic question of the Pope's Meridian. There was no reconciling of theory with fact. 'Ours indisputably,' said Spain, with loud articulate voice; 'Holiness the Pope made it ours!'--while fact and the English, by Decree of the Eternal Destinies, had been grumbling inarticulately the other way, for almost two hundred years past, and no result had.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth, contested claims to the water of a small stream in south-central New Mexico {{produced}} a storm of legal activity. The maelstrom arose out of the tangled complications surrounding the development of non-Indian water rights to the Tularosa Creek. The creek was a small spring-fed stream that headed on the Mescalero Apache Indian homelands in the Sacramento Mountains. From its beginnings, the creek ran west, first through a narrow canyon and then out onto a broad plain before petering out in the porous White Sands. Between 1880 and 1919, this unpromising wilderness produced two full trials: one <b>interim</b> district court <b>decree</b> that became final, one final district court decree that was reversed, and no fewer than three New Mexico Supreme Court decisions. l In the eye of this legal hurricane, New Mexico transformed its basic water institutions...|$|R

They had not been there long before an immense crowd invaded the Chamber, {{shouting}} [...] "Long live the Republic!" [...] Thiers fled on foot, and made his way back to his house. A new government was quickly formed by the republicans Lamartine and Ledru-Rollin, but Thiers had no part in it. The new <b>interim</b> government quickly <b>decreed</b> the freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and called for new parliamentary elections, in which all men over the age of 21, who had been resident in their home for six months, could vote, raising the number of eligible voters from 200,000 to nine million. The Chamber was expanded to a National Assembly with nine hundred members. New elections were held; [...] Thiers ran as a candidate in Marseille, and, for the first and only time in his career, was defeated. However, on 15 May, the more radical socialists staged effort to seize the government; [...] they invaded the chamber and proclaimed a new government. This time, the Republican National Guard responded quickly to defend the government, recapturing the hall and the government. The socialist deputies who had taken part were expelled from the Assembly, leaving open seats. New elections for the open seats were held on 4 June, and Thiers was elected in four departments; [...] Seine, Gironde, Orne, and Seine-Inferiure. He chose to be deputy for Seine-Inferieure.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} as its main subject the {{analysis}} of the public policies drawn up by the Brazilian State through normative regulations for the higher education. Using as categories of analysis the university autonomy and the funding of higher education, the research is {{based on the premise that}} public policies have been build from legal regulations. Thus, we searched into the Brazilian State public policies issued by it through legal standards and its consequences in higher education. This study is a bibliographic research that performs a detailed survey of the legal system developed by the Brazilian State for higher education from the Federal Constitution of 1988 until the year 2006. We found out that subsequently to the current Constitution, forty four legal regulations, two of them being constitutional amendments, eleven laws, three <b>interim</b> measures, nine <b>decrees,</b> among others normative standards were approved regarding the university autonomy and funding of higher education, and that also concurred to a profound change in the constitutional text. In the development of the study we started with the argumentation about the State, in order to establish the relations between the Law and the public policies. Then, we draw an historical contextualization of all Brazilian Constitutions, with emphasis on the process of redemocratization started in 1974 and reaching its highest point in the Constitution of 1988, whose key feature was its definition as the most democratic Magna Carta known in Brazil. In this Constitution, we discuss the articles that infer on university autonomy and funding of higher education. Based on the discussion of the Brazilian State and the information provided by the Constitutional Law, we conducted an analysis of post-constitutional legislation that sets policies for Brazilian higher education directed to finance that level of education and university autonomy. Taking as reference the constitutional text, we discourse about the constitutionality control as a legal principle. The study showed that most of the infra-constitutional legal rules regulating Brazilian higher education act contra legem mater, when, for example, proceed against the article 207, interfering on the choice of the university leaders, injuring the ability of the university itself legislate about its own topics, or when disentail provided percentages for the financing of higher education, such as the Revisal Constitutional Amendment n. 1 / 1994 and Constitutional Amendment n. 10 / 1996, injuring constitutional principles and representing the interests of the neoliberal capitalist state. The study presents a contribution for the educational public policies field, since it allows reflections on the way that the subjective public law comes to education, assured in the constitutional text, has been systematically and successive denied by governments after the Federal Constitution of 1988 that folow the neoliberal state model. O presente estudo teve como objeto central analisar as políticas públicas exaradas pelo Estado brasileiro, via espécies normativas para a educação superior. Tendo como categorias de análise a autonomia da universidade, e o financiamento da educação superior. A pesquisa parte da premissa de que as políticas públicas têm sido materializadas a partir de normas jurídicas. Assim, investigamos o Estado brasileiro, as políticas públicas por ele emanadas por meio de espécies normativas e suas implicações na educação superior. O estudo foi realizado por meio de pesquisa bibliográfica que consistiu num levantamento minucioso do ordenamento jurídico elaborado pelo Estado brasileiro para a educação superior a partir da Constituição Federal de 1988 até o ano de 2006. Detectamos que após a CF/ 88, no que concerne à autonomia da universidade e ao financiamento da educação superior, foram aprovadas quarenta e quatro normas jurídicas, sendo duas Emendas Constitucionais, onze Leis, três medidas provisórias, nove Decretos, dentre outras espécies normativas, que contribuíram para alterar de forma profunda o texto constitucional. No desenvolvimento do estudo iniciamos com a discussão sobre o Estado com vistas a estabelecer relações com o direito e as políticas públicas. Em seguida, traçamos uma contextualização histórica de todas as Constituições brasileiras, mas com ênfase no processo de redemocratização iniciado em 1974 e que culminou na CF/ 88, cuja característica essencial foi sua definição como a Carta Magna mais democrática que se tem nota no Brasil. Dessa carta, analisamos os artigos que inferem sobre a autonomia universitária e o financiamento da educação superior. Com base na discussão sobre o Estado regulador brasileiro e nas indicações fornecidas pela ciência do Direito constitucional, realizamos a análise da legislação pós-constitucional que define as políticas para a educação superior brasileira direcionada ao financiamento desse nível de ensino e à autonomia da universidade. Tendo como referência o texto constitucional, discorremos sobre o instituto jurídico do controle de constitucionalidade. O estudo apontou que grande parte das normas jurídicas infraconstitucionais, que regulamenta a educação superior brasileira, atua contra legem mater, quando, por exemplo, dispõe contra o art. 207 ao interferir sobre a escolha de dirigentes universitários, ferindo a capacidade da universidade se auto-legislar sobre assuntos que lhe são próprios, ou quando desvincula percentuais assegurados para o financiamento da educação superior, no caso da emenda constitucional de revisão n. 1 / 1994 e Emenda Constitucional n. 10 / 1996, ferindo princípios constitucionais e reproduzindo interesses do Estado capitalista neoliberal. O estudo apresenta contribuição para o campo das políticas públicas educacionais, vez que possibilita reflexões sobre a forma pela qual o direito público subjetivo à educação, assegurado no texto constitucional, vem sendo negado sistematicamente e de forma sucessiva pelos governos pós CF/ 88 que adotam o modelo de Estado neoliberal...|$|R
