50|$|An <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer</b> (often {{abbreviated}} to inverse MUX or IMUX) allows a data stream {{to be broken}} into multiple lower data rate communication links. An <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer</b> differs from a demultiplexer because the multiple output streams from the former stay inter-related, whereas those from the latter are unrelated. An <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer</b> {{is the opposite of}} a multiplexer in that it divides one high-speed link into multiple low-speed links, whereas a multiplexer combines multiple low-speed links into one high-speed link.|$|E

In the case of IP, network packets could be sent in round-robin mode between each separate link. Advantages of using inverse multiplexing over separate links include: ...|$|E
50|$|This {{provides}} {{an end to}} end connection of several times the data rate available {{on each of the}} low rate data links. Note that, as with multiplexers, links are often used in bi-directional pairs and, {{at either end of the}} link, an <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer</b> will be combined with its reverse (an inverse demultiplexer) and still be called an inverse MUX.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inverse</b> <b>multiplexers</b> are used, for example, {{to combine}} {{a number of}} ISDN {{channels}} together into one high rate circuit, where a higher rate connection than is available from a single ISDN connection is needed. This is typically useful in areas where higher rate circuits are not available.|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} of {{bandwidth}} users made, indicates {{that access to}} ATM networks is an important issue. The Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) is a technology that combines multiple T 1 /E 1 links to create a single logical data trunk which bandwidth is the aggregate of the T 1 /E 1 ones, minus a small amount due to overhead. By using this technology, {{it is possible to}} have ATM connections with data rates between the T 1 /E 1 (an economical but too slow option) and T 3 /E 3 ones (with high bandwidth, but expensive). Also, it is interesting to have expressions easy to compute that approximate the main Quality of Service parameters of <b>Inverse</b> <b>Multiplexers</b> (IMUX) to help network planners in the dimensioning of these systems. In this paper, we study an estimate for the Cell Loss Ratio (CLR) measured in the IMUX devices. Keywords: ATM, Performance Evaluation, Inverse Multiplexing, Modeling, Approximate Analysis. 1.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{diversity}} in the transmission technologies in current data networks. Individual technologies are in most cases incompatible at physical and partially also at the link layer of the reference ISO/OSI model. Network compatibility, {{as the ability to}} transmit data, is realizable through the third layer, which is able to guarantee the operation of the different devices across their technological differences. The proposed <b>inverse</b> packet <b>multiplexer</b> addresses increase of the speed and reliability of packet transmission to the third layer, {{and at the same time}} it increases the stability of the data communication by the regulation of the delay value during the transmission. This article presents implementation of a communication system and its verification in real conditions. The conclusion compares the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed control system...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{increasing}} of {{the transmission}} rate in a telecommunications network {{is possible in}} various ways. One of them is inverse multiplexing. The <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer</b> divides a data stream to multiple parallel channels. This principle not only allows to increase the total available transmission rate, but also allows to reduce the error rate and interruption in data stream. The digital subscriber line {{may be used for}} the implementation of the inverse multiplex. Accurate knowledge of the transmission parameters of a digital subscriber line and the entire infrastructure of the network provider is necessary for the effective functioning of the terminal device with inverse multiplexing. It is necessary to know not only the parameters related to the transmission rate, but above all the parameters relevant to the time characteristics of data transmission. This paper describes how to obtain the transmission parameters of real digital subscriber lines and their modelling...|$|E
40|$|New {{application}} services, such as multimedia, digital images, {{video on}} demand, and high bandwidth data services, demand bandwidth {{much higher than}} those available from existing Public Switched Digital Network (PSDN). These new services have {{a wide range of}} traffic flow characteristics and Quality of Services (QoS) requirements. To meet the new requirements, network providers use a technique called inverse multiplexing which combines two or more independent switched digital channels into a single high bandwidth end-to-end connection. In this paper we focus our study on the dynamic allocation and management of bandwidth by inverse multiplexers to support variable bandwidth applications. We add a Quality of Service feature in the BONDING protocol for the <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer.</b> A real-time algorithm is developed to compute blocking probability experienced by network users during a connection establishment phase (external blocking) and during a data transfer phase (internal blocking). We show [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Multi-homed mobile hosts in {{physical}} proximity may spontaneously team up {{to form a}} community and run high-bandwidth applications by pooling their low wireless widearea network (WWAN) bandwidths together for communication with a remote application server. Utilizing their high-bandwidth wireless local-area network (WLAN), the thus-teamed mobile hosts can aggregate and distribute the application content among themselves. This paper first justifies {{the need for such}} a mobile collaborative community (MC 2), or a community, to improve user-perceived network bandwidth and utilization. Then, existing one-to-one communication protocols like TCP are shown to suffer significant performance degradation due to frequent out-of-order packet deliveries. To address this TCP problem, we propose a proxy-based <b>inverse</b> <b>multiplexer,</b> called PRISM, that enables TCP to efficiently utilize the community members ’ WWAN connections while avoiding the performance degradation. PRISM runs at the proxy’s network layer as a routing component and stripes each TCP flow over multiple WWAN links by exploiting the transport-layer feedback information. Moreover, it masks a variety of adverse effects specific to each WWAN link via an intelligent ACK-control mechanism. Finally, PRISM enables TCP to respond correctly to dynamically-changing network states through a sender-side enhancement of congestion control. PRISM has been evaluated with experimentation on a testbed as well ns- 2 -based simulation. Our experimental evaluation has shown PRISM to improve TCP’s performance by up to 310 % even with two collaborative mobile hosts. Our in-depth simulation study has also shown that PRISM delivers a near-optimal aggregated bandwidth in the community, and improves network utilization significantly.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaAs {{the number}} of {{telemetry}} applications at sites increases, {{the need for a}} higher bandwidth link from site-to-site grows. The use of an <b>inverse</b> T 1 <b>multiplexer</b> allows the site to utilize multiple T 1 lines rather than more costly higher bandwidth lines. There are many advantages to using a recognized packet standard, such as IRIG- 107 / 98, over simply routing the streams through T 1 lines. One advantage {{is that there is a}} total separation of data stream clock from T 1 transmission clock, reducing synchronization circuitry and overhead. Another advantage is that the use of packets also allows for a smooth reconstructed clock phase on the receiving site, creating a virtually seamless transmission of clock and data. And, finally, by using a recognized packet standard, the <b>inverse</b> T 1 <b>multiplexer</b> may easily be integrated into ranging and telemetry systems already incorporating packetized telemetry. This paper will discuss the combination of packets and inverse multiplexing to achieve an expandable transmission system capable of delivering a high bandwidth data stream across multiple T 1 lines...|$|R
