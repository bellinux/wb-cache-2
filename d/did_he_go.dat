5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go?).</b> In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
25|$|Sykes's RCA tutor, Barry Hart, {{who knew}} Freddie Beddington, {{founder of the}} Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle, {{suggested}} he become a camouflage officer. Richard Buckley, one of the Farnham lecturers, promptly recruited Sykes as {{an officer in the}} Royal Engineers. He was posted to France in March 1940 and evacuated from Dunkirk in May. Only then <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go</b> on a camouflage training course at Farnham.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go</b> willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

500|$|His cricket aspirations, already {{hindered}} due {{to economic}} difficulties {{caused by the}} Great Depression, were further interrupted when he was wheelchair-bound for months after a ruptured appendix in 1938. He {{was not allowed to}} enlist in the Australian Defence Force during World War II and worked at Lithgow's Small Arms factory, in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Only {{at the end of the}} war, aged 30, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go</b> to Sydney. At the time, he was a medium-fast left-arm bowler and approached Petersham—as Toshack lived in their locality, they had the right to register him ahead of other clubs. They did not select Toshack, so he joined Marrickville in Sydney Grade Cricket, starting in the third grade team in 1944–45. Within two matches, he rose to the first grade team. By this time, Petersham regretted their decision to spurn Toshack and lodged a complaint with the cricket authorities, claiming that he was obliged to represent them and ineligible to play for Marrickville. Toshack later recalled that Petersham were [...] "told where to go".|$|E
500|$|Nansen's {{status was}} never seriously challenged, {{although}} he did not escape criticism. American explorer Robert Peary wondered why Nansen had not returned to the ship when his polar dash was thwarted after a mere three weeks away. [...] "Was he ashamed to go back after so short an absence, or had there been a row ... or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go</b> off for Franz Josef Land from sensational motives or business reasons?" [...] Adolphus Greely, who had initially dismissed the entire expedition as infeasible, admitted that he had been proved wrong but nevertheless drew attention to [...] "the single blemish"—Nansen's decision to leave his comrades hundreds of miles from land. [...] "It passes comprehension", Greely wrote, [...] "how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition." [...] Nansen's reputation nevertheless survived; a hundred years after the expedition the British explorer Wally Herbert called the Fram voyage [...] "one of the most inspiring examples of courageous intelligence in the history of exploration".|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go</b> to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E

2500|$|In 1480 the Vespucci family {{commissioned}} a fresco figure of Saint Augustine for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's. [...] Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. [...] As in other cases, such direct competition [...] "was always an inducement to Botticelli {{to put out}} all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Hebert Lighbown. [...] The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known. [...] Most of the [...] "text" [...] is scribbles, but one line reads: [...] "Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>go?</b> He is outside Porta al Prato", probably dialogue overheard from [...] the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. [...] Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought [...] "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".|$|E

2500|$|Verb second (V2) word order, {{which is}} {{uncommon}} cross-linguistically.
