25|$|The {{last four}} matches {{in the regular}} season stage of the women's National League were also completed; Queensland hosted Victoria for two games, and {{qualified}} for the final after a 42-run win in the first match (where they restricted Victoria to 109 for 9 in 32 overs chasing 152 to win), and a century from 21-year-old Kasee Marxsen helped them set a target of 97 to win against the Bushrangers. The Scorpions travelled to Perth, but despite winning both matches, they finished third in the overall standings, and did not qualify for the final series against the Breakers.

6000|$|Presently we sighted {{the trails}} of sheep and goats, showing the {{proximity}} of a village: their freshness was ascertained by my companions after an eager scrutiny in the moon's bright beams. About half an hour afterwards, rough ravines with sharp and thorny descents warned us that we had exchanged the dangerous plain for a place of safety where horsemen rarely venture. Raghe, not admiring the [...] "open," [...] hurried us onward, in hope of reaching some kraal. At 8 P.M., however, seeing the poor women lamed with thorns, and the camels casting themselves upon the ground, I resolved to halt. Despite all objections, we lighted a <b>fire,</b> <b>finished</b> our store of bad milk--the water had long ago been exhausted--and lay down in the cold, clear air, covering ourselves with hides and holding our weapons.|$|E
60|$|For with Margaret, {{it may be}} said at once, he {{was quite}} in love. At {{the sight of her}} sweet yet {{imperial}} beauty, as he saw her first, dishevelled, angry, frightened, in the crowd outside the king's banqueting-hall, his southern blood had taken sudden <b>fire.</b> <b>Finished</b> voluptuary though he was, the sensation he experienced then was quite new to him. He longed for this woman as he had never longed for any other, and, what is more, he desired to make her his wife. Why not? Although there was a flaw in it, his rank was high, and therefore she was beneath him; but for this her loveliness would atone, and she had wit and learning enough to fill any place that he could give her. Also, great as was his wealth, his wanton, spendthrift way of life had brought him many debts, and she was the only child of one of the richest merchants in England, whose dower, doubtless, would be a fortune that many a royal princess might envy. Why not again? He would turn Inez and those others adrift--at any rate, for a while--and make her mistress of his palace there in Granada. Instantly, as is often the fashion of those who have Eastern blood in their veins, d'Aguilar had made up his mind, yes, before he left her father's table on the previous night. He would marry Margaret and no other woman.|$|E

60|$|The {{story that}} is told of the manner of his death is this: There was in his court a man named Mænon, whom Agathocles had taken captive when a youth, and ever since {{retained}} in his court. Though originally a captive, taken in war, Mænon had been made a favorite with Agathocles, and had been raised to a high position in his service. The indulgence however, and the favoritism with {{which he had been}} regarded, were not such as to awaken any sentiments of gratitude in Mænon's mind, or to establish any true and faithful friendship between him and his master; and Archagathus, the grandson, found means of inducing him to undertake to poison the king. As all the ordinary modes of administering poison were precluded by the vigilance and strictness with which the usual avenues of approach to the king were guarded, Mænon contrived to accomplish his end by poisoning a quill which the king was subsequently to use as a tooth-pick. The poison was insinuated thus into the teeth and gums of the victim, where it soon took effect, producing dreadful ulceration and intolerable pain. The infection of the venom after a short time pervaded the whole system of the sufferer, and brought him to the brink of the grave; and at last, finding that he was speechless, and apparently insensible, his ruthless murderers, fearing, perhaps, that he might revive again, hurried him to the funeral pile before life was extinct, and the <b>fire</b> <b>finished</b> the work that the poison had begun.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fire</b> <b>finished</b> {{the regular}} season with a 14-13-7 record, but {{narrowly}} missed the playoffs, losing the spot to the Montreal Impact on second tiebreaker.

In {{the second half of the}} season, with little to play for, Barcelona went 1-4.

50|$|In its short, three-year history, the Portland Fire {{franchise}} held some of {{the more}} dubious distinctions among WNBA franchises. Founded in 2000, Portland Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen served as the team's chairman. Led by Vanessa Nygaard and Sylvia Crawley, the team managed a 10-22 win-loss record in their inaugural season. In the 2001 season, the team faced another losing season but found hope in the play of rookie guard Jackie Stiles, who would win the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award. However, in 2002 Stiles suffered a severe injury and was out for most of the season. Without their star player, the <b>Fire</b> <b>finished</b> with an even record.|$|E
50|$|This failure {{prompted}} Cullen to {{sell the}} team to Major League Indoor Football, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, who announced the team would relocate to the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In just three weeks the new management headed by team president Bryan Dresden, moved the team from Daytona Beach opening to an inaugural crowd of over 2500 new fans in Huntsville, Alabama. The renamed Huntsville <b>Fire</b> <b>finished</b> {{the season with a}} record of 13 wins and 11 losses, including 1 shootout win. This gave the team a total of 38 points for the 1997 season and 4th place in the seven-team league.|$|E

50|$|Sarachan's {{second year}} was {{significantly}} harder, however, as star defender Carlos Bocanegra left MLS for Fulham {{before the season}} began, and he lost national teamer DaMarcus Beasley to PSV Eindhoven in midseason; numerous other injuries plagued the team, and the Fire ended the season tied for the league's worst record, at 8-13-9. The <b>Fire</b> <b>finished</b> at 15-13-4 in 2005. In Sarachan's fourth season, the Chicago Fire took their fourth Lamar Hunt Open Cup. The Fire's appearance in MLS Cup 2003 led to an invite to the 2004 CONCACAF Champions Cup, during which Chicago registered a combined 2-2-0 record against San Juan Jabloteh of Trinidad & Tobago (quarterfinals) and Costa Rican powerhouse Deportivo Saprissa (semifinals).|$|E

In January 2008, he was named the first technical director for the Fire. He was appointed the Fire's interim manager following the dismissal of Carlos de los Cobos in May 2011. Klopas earned his first MLS managerial win in a 1-0 victory over the Columbus Crew thirteen days later on June 12.

Along with Yallop's departure, the club announced it had named long-time MLS executive Nelson Rodriguez as the club's new General Manager, with his first job being to commence {{a search for a}} new head coach.
