25|$|The initial French {{reaction}} to the island's fall was to tell the British they could keep it if they wanted, but could expect no compensation if they <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> It was soon realised {{that this was not}} a plausible stance, as the island could be used as a base for privateers and the Royal Navy. Ultimately after two years of occupation the island was handed back to France in the wake of the Treaty of Paris (1763), exchanged directly for the return of Menorca to Britain.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was called}} from the SCG Members bar in 2005 to field as the 13th man for Australia against Pakistan for five minutes, he refused to keep the gear he was offered because Cowan did not believe he {{deserved}} it. Then, when NSW prematurely presented him with his baggy blue after he was picked as 12th man for the state's one-day team, he marched into Cricket NSW boss Dave Gilbert's office and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> saying he would accept {{it when he was}} entitled to wear the cap.|$|E

25|$|Ypres {{became a}} cloth trading {{center in the}} Middle Ages and was first {{fortified}} in the period 1200–1400. The Spanish strengthened the medieval defenses early in the 1600s. The French captured the city but <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Spain in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. The Walloon engineer Jean Boulengier greatly improved the works in 1669. Nevertheless, in a 1678 siege the city was captured by the French. The military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban immediately set about making extensive changes to the defenses that year and later in 1682. The modernizations made Ypres a fortress of the first class. Ironically, Ypres was {{handed over to the}} Dutch Republic by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, along with Veurne (Furnes), Fort Knokke, Menen, Tournai, Mons, Charleroi, Namur and Ghent. Though the fortresses were in the Austrian Netherlands, they were intended to serve as a barrier to protect Holland. Emperor Joseph II slighted the defenses of Ypres though they were later partly restored.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately for John V, he {{had other}} European {{connections}} — his mother was Anna of Savoy, and her nephew (being John V's cousin) was concerned {{for the safety of}} his Greek counterpart. Sailing from Venice in June 1366 with dreams of initiating yet another Crusade, Amadeo VI of Savoy arrived at and seized the fortress of Gallipoli from the Ottomans and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the Byzantines, hoping that this would stem the tide of Turkish emigration into Thrace. However, the Turks had by now firmly established themselves in Thrace. Amadeo and John spent much time between 1367 and 1369 thinking of ways to stave off defeat. Amadeo returned to Europe via Rome and brought with him Byzantine envoys. The Pope again was uninterested, but called for John V to visit him. In 1369, when the Ottomans finally captured Adrianople (though some sources indicate 1365), John V rushed to Rome and confessed his Catholic faith both privately and at a public spectacle.|$|E
500|$|Carus asked Anning {{to write}} her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference—she wrote it as [...] "Mary Annins"—and when she <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to him she told him: [...] "I am well known {{throughout}} the whole of Europe." [...] As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the Magazine of Natural History to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark Hybodus represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago. The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.|$|E

500|$|On February 19, 1999, he surpassed Al MacInnis as the {{franchise}} scoring leader with his 823rd career point. He held {{the record for}} ten years until surpassed by Jarome Iginla in 2009. The Flames, who had been struggling financially and were unable to sign Fleury to a new contract, chose to trade him {{less than two weeks}} after he broke the record rather than risk losing him to free agency. He was dealt to the Colorado Avalanche on February 28 for René Corbet, Wade Belak and Robyn Regehr. [...] Although it was expected to a certain extent, the trade nonetheless stunned fans in Calgary. His popularity was such that during a game in 1999, after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a bloody jersey, a fan threw his own souvenir jersey over the boards so that Fleury would not miss a shift. He put the jersey on before realizing it was autographed and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
500|$|By 2:00p.m., the 11th New York and 1st Minnesota {{were joined}} by the 14th Brooklyn Regiment and again took their place behind the Union guns. However, soon {{confusion}} again erupted on the battlefield in front of them. [...] As the gunners confronted the blue-clad 33rd Virginia, Major Barry ordered Ricketts to hold his fire, allowing the Virginians to charge the batteries and capture the guns. While the 14th Brooklyn was able to quickly retake the guns, the Union regiments supporting the cannon were unable to withstand the near constant barrage from Confederate artillery and infantry and fell back again to the Manassas-Sudley Road. The 11th New York, the Irish 69th New York Militia and 14th Brooklyn would charge Henry Hill four times, first {{in an effort to}} retake Ricketts' and Griffin's cannon, but each attempt failed. In the wild melee, the 69th's color bearers were killed and its colors lost, but an officer of the 11th, Captain John Wildey, was able to recapture the Irish color, and then <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the grateful Irishmen.|$|E
2500|$|While Vizcaya {{exploded}} at 1:20pm, Captain Jose de Paredes, {{declining to}} see his crew needlessly killed, abruptly turned the undamaged Cristóbal Colón toward {{the mouth of the}} Turquino River and ordered the scuttle valves opened and the colors struck as she grounded. Captain Cook of the Brooklyn went on board to receive the surrender. The Oregon {{was in charge of the}} Colón’s wreck and ordered to save her if possible. All of the prisoners were to be transferred to the [...] Despite all efforts, the Colón was taken by the sea and sank in shoal water. As the ships of the U.S. fleet pushed through the carnage, rescuing as many Spanish survivors as possible, one officer was fished out by sailors of Iowa. This man proved to be Captain Don Antonio Eulate of Vizcaya. He thanked his rescuers and presented his sword to Captain Robley Evans, who <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> as an act of chivalry.|$|E

2500|$|Private Norman Demuth, who {{had been}} {{discharged}} from the British Army after being wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after returning from the Western Front, and decided that if the women that handed them out {{were going to be}} rude to him, {{he was going to be}} rude back. One of the last feathers he received was presented to him whilst he was travelling on a bus, by a lady who was sat opposite him. She handed over the feather and said, [...] "Here's a gift for a brave soldier." [...] Demuth replied, [...] "Thank you very much - I wanted one of those." [...] He then used the feather to clean out his pipe, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to her and remarked, [...] "You know we didn't get these in the trenches."

2500|$|In Denmark, Maria Eleonora {{became the}} guest of King Christian IV. The Elector George William refused to receive his sister in Brandenburg, so Maria Eleonora {{had to wait until}} his death in December that year before her nephew gave her {{permission}} to visit Brandenburg. Still, the new Elector insisted that Sweden should provide for his aunt's upkeep. She received a small pension of 30,000 écus a year. After a while Maria Eleonora surprisingly started to long for Sweden, and in 1648 she returned. Queen Christina went to meet her mother's ship. It was delayed by a storm and the young queen slept in the open for two nights and contracted a fever, which kept her in bed for some days. In October 1650 Maria Eleonora proudly attended her daughter's postponed coronation ceremony. Christina then bought the newly erected castle Makalös ("Unequalled") for her, close to the royal castle in Stockholm. [...] It would have been enormously expensive, but Christina never paid. [...] Instead she <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> in 1652.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 March Fitzwilliam said in {{a letter}} to Lord Carlisle that it was his removal of Beresford and his friends for their [...] "maladministration" [...] and not Emancipation that was his downfall. Pitt was {{determined}} to use the Bill as an excuse {{to get rid of the}} Whig government in Ireland, spurred on by [...] "secret, unavowed, insidious informations" [...] and breaking the terms of the coalition agreed with the Duke of Portland. The claim that he had breached the agreement was merely the excuse needed to get rid of him due to the resentment by the Ascendancy at their loss of power. He instead claimed his administration had been a success, enjoying widespread popularity amongst the Irish and granted by the Irish House of Commons [...] "the largest supplies that have ever been demanded". Fitzwilliam urged Lord Carlisle to show this to [...] "as many persons as you shall think proper". On 9 March Fitzwilliam {{said in a}} letter to James Adair: [...] "Here I am, abandoned, deserted and given up—an object of the general calumny of administration, for they must abuse me to justify themselves". After hearing reading in government newspapers that his recall was due to Emancipation, Fitzwilliam wrote to Lord Carlisle on 23 March and said that the Catholic question entered for nothing into the real cause of my recall" [...] and that he acted within the bounds of the agreement decided on 15 November. He said repeated requests for instructions to the Cabinet on the bill had been ignored whilst they had responded almost at once to the dismissal of Beresford and his friends. The visit of Beresford to London and the prospect of a [...] "change in system" [...] in Ireland made the Cabinet recall him. The Duke of Portland had been seduced into altering [...] "all his former opinions respecting the politics of this country" [...] and he was now Pitt's instrument. Pitt had used the situation to abandon the coalition agreement with the Whigs that the Irish administration be under the Home Secretary, the Duke of Portland. Pitt had resumed control of it and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the corrupt Ascendancy.|$|E
