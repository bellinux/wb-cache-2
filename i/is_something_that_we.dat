25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, Most Wanted {{was seen}} to be [...] "a no-brainer" [...] for a series pick-up by {{industry}} insiders. However, in early May it {{was said to be}} [...] "cooling" [...] and [...] "not considered the lock it once was". At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it.

500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library. According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com, [...] "the Saturn {{will go down}} in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time." [...] In 2009, IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, [...] "While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo... Nights into Dreams, the Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite." [...] The staff of Edge noted [...] "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga." [...] In 2015, The Guardians Keith Stuart declared [...] "the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran stated [...] "Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it." [...] IGN's Adam Redsell wrote [...] " [...] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> simply do not see outside of the indie scene today." [...] Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that [...] "The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan... some games, like Enemy Zero used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served." [...] Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party titles as [...] "Sega's shining moment as a game developer", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of [...] "fresh ideas" [...] and [...] "precious few high-profile franchises", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what have you. And I summarize all this in what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to go out and find that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. And this is an ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> owe to each other.|$|E

That the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job, and that {{the way in which}} they perpetually play into each other's hands is not an everlasting coincidence. Gudge, the plutocrat, wants an anarchic industrialism; Hudge, the idealist, provides him with lyric praises of anarchy. Gudge wants women-workers because they are cheaper; Hudge calls the woman's work [...] "freedom to live her own life." [...] Gudge wants steady and obedient workmen, Hudge preaches teetotalism--to workmen, not to Gudge--Gudge wants a tame and timid population who will never take arms against tyranny; Hudge proves from Tolstoi that nobody must take arms against anything. Gudge is naturally a healthy and well-washed gentleman; Hudge earnestly preaches the perfection of Gudge's washing to people who can't practice it. Above all, Gudge rules by a coarse and cruel system of sacking and sweating and bi-sexual toil which is totally inconsistent with the free family and which is bound to destroy it; therefore Hudge, stretching out his arms to the universe with a prophetic smile, tells us that the family <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall soon gloriously outgrow.|$|E
