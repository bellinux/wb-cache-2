50|$|Height above mean {{sea level}} (AMSL) is the {{elevation}} (on the ground) or altitude (in the air) of an object, relative to the average sea level datum.

An alternative is to base height measurements on an ellipsoid of the entire Earth, which is what systems such as GPS do. In aviation, the ellipsoid known as World Geodetic System 84 is increasingly used to define heights, however, differences up to 100 m exist between this <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> and mean tidal height.

40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of height error on the {{coordinate}} transformation accuracy of three dimensional and two dimensional coordinates between TWD 97 and TWD 67 {{on the basis of}} Taiwan geodetic datum TWD 97, this paper conducts the conversion between TWD 97 and TWD 67 on the second-order satellite control points in central Taiwan according to the seven-parameter transformation model of Molodensky-Badekas and Bursa-Wolf. Without the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> information of TWD 67, this paper chooses the common points to ensure the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of TWD 67 and of TWD 97 is the same before conducting the conversion. There are two methods applied in this paper to compare the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of the common points. The first method is to return the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of both TWD 67 and TWD 97 at the common points to zero and change the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of TWD 67 leading the variation to a constant (± 10 、± 20 、± 25 M). The second method is to change the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of TWD 67 with random variables to create constants (± 1 ~ 3 、± 3 ~ 5 、± 5 ~ 10 M) for comparing {{the effect of}} height variation on the conversion accuracy of three dimensional and two dimensional coordinates between TWD 97 and TWD 67. The result shows that the seven-parameter transformation model of Molodensky-Badekas and Bursa-Wolf applied in this study presents the same conversion result. The conversion results of TWD 67 and TWD 97 with the same height, method one (changing the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> of TWD 67), and method two (changing the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> within 3 - 5 M) hardly affect the plane coordinate, with only ± 1 cm root-mean-square error of (dN,dE) and dh root-mean-square error is about the average of the height variation for the common points. 自國家大地基準TWD 97 建立後，為探討高程誤差對於TWD 97 坐標和TWD 67 坐標間大區域三維及二維坐標轉換精度之影響，本文利用臺灣中部地區二等衛星控制點，以Molodensky-Badekas模式及Bursa-Wolf模式之七參數坐標轉換模式，進行TWD 97 與TWD 67 間坐標轉換；由於這些控制點，並無TWD 67 坐標橢球高資料，因此在選定實驗區共同點後，首先令其橢球高與TWD 97 坐標之橢球高相等進行坐標轉換所得之結果，再與下述兩種更動共同點橢球高之方法進行比較：方法 1. 令共同點之TWD 67 與TWD 97 之橢球高皆為零、更動共同點TWD 67 坐標橢球高，其變化量為一常數值（如± 10 、± 20 、± 25 M等）；方法 2. 以隨機變數更動共同點TWD 67 坐標之橢球高，其變化量為一區間之變數(如± 1 ~ 3 、± 3 ~ 5 、± 5 ~ 10 M等) ，來比較高程變化對於TWD 97 坐標與TWD 67 坐標間三維及二維坐標轉換精度的影響。 研究結果顯示：利用Bursa-Wolf模式及Molodensky-Badekas 模式之七參數坐標轉換模式，進行坐標轉換，其轉換結果為一致。對於實驗區共同點TWD 67 與TWD 97 橢球高視為相等之轉換結果，與方法 1. 更動共同點TWD 67 坐標之橢球高之轉換結果，及與方法 2. 更動共同點TWD 67 坐標之橢球高 3 ~ 5 M內，轉換後之平面坐標，幾乎無影響，其（dN,dE）均方根誤差（RMSE）為± 1 cm內，高程方面，dh均方根誤差約為共同點高程變化量的平均值。誌謝 Ⅰ 摘要 Ⅱ Abstract Ⅳ 目錄 Ⅵ 表目錄 Ⅷ 圖目錄 Ⅸ 第一章 緒論 1 1 - 1 前言 1 1 - 2 研究動機與目的 1 1 - 3 文獻回顧 4 1 - 4 論文架構 6 第二章 研究理論基礎 7 2 - 1 坐標系統 7 2 - 1 - 1 TWD 67 坐標系統 7 2 - 1 - 2 TWD 97 坐標系統 7 2 - 1 - 3 高程系統 10 2 - 2 坐標轉換 11 2 - 2 - 1 二度TM坐標與經緯度大地坐標系之轉換 12 2 - 2 - 2 經緯度大地坐標與三維直角地心坐標系之轉換 14 2 - 2 - 3 七參數線性坐標轉換 15 第三章 研究方法與流程 17 3 - 1 實驗資料取得與整理 17 3 - 2 研究方法 17 3 - 2 實驗區簡介 20 第四章 研究成果分析 27 4 - 1 A實驗區成果分析 27 4 - 2 B實驗區成果分析 37 4 - 3 C實驗區成果分析 46 第五章 結論與建議 48 5 - 1 結論 48 5 - 2 建議 49 參考文獻 5...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} the two U. S. national hybrid geoid models (GEOID 09 and GEOID 03) in Connecticut. I compared National Geodetic Survey (NGS) North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) orthometric heights with orthometric heights determined by subtracting modeled (GEOID 09 and GEOID 03) geoid heights from NAVSTAR Global Position System (GPS) -derived <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights.</b> The GPS observation campaign (2007 – 2008) followed NGS guidelines for <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights,</b> and resulted in 60 days of GPS observations on 50 First-Order bench marks and 22 temporary bench marks with transferred elevations. I determined <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> with least-squares adjustments of baseline vector networks using TOPCON Pinnacle GNSS observation processing software package, holding 12 Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) as control. I used On-line Positioning User Service (OPUS) -ellipsoid heights as a check, and found no statistically significant differences (2 - σ) between adjusted <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> and OPUS <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights.</b> I examined the effects of phase center variation (PCV) by computing ellipsoid-height differences between the network with PCV corrections and the same network without PCV corrections. The differences were statistically significant (2 - σ) and the uncorrected PCV network produces biased-solutions. I investigated the effect on <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> resulting from allowing vectors not meeting NGS quality standards into the network. There were no statistically-significant differences (2 - σ) in a network of a single-day 2 ̆ 7 s data nor in a network of all data. Adjusted GPS-derived orthometric heights were subtracted from NGS published heights, and I performed residual analyses and two residuals at bench marks {{on the edge of the}} study area appeared as outliers. Analysis of residuals at bench marks belonging to NGS specified stability classes A, B and C revealed statistically significant differences between each class. The maximum residual value increases with decreasing stability class. I also analyzed the residuals by fitting a planar regression model, computing a datum transformation model, and by using kriging estimation. The results suggest that the residuals are random with no significant underlying spatial structure, which indicates that GEOID 09 and GEOID 03 perform within NGS-published specifications (Roman et al., 2009 and 2004) with no evidence of bias. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. During {{the past}} decade, global {{positioning}} system (CPS) survey data {{have been used to}} establish precise relative positioning in a three-dimensional system. CPS survey methods can and have been used to replace classical horizontal control terrestrial survey methods. However, it was only during the last few years that these techniques have been applied to classical leveling (vertical control) applications. CPS-derived orthometric heights were computed for 18 monuments of the Baltimore County, Maryland, geodetic control network following the NCS guidelines. Comparisons were made between six second-order leveling-derived NAVD 88 stations and CPS-derived orthometric heights computed using adjusted <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> and a high-resolution geoid model. The precision of the CPS-derived <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> was better than 2 cm and the CPS-derived orthometric heights agreed with published NAVD 88 values to within 2 cm. S inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{positioning}} {{accuracy of the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) has been improved considerably {{during the past two}} decades. The main error sources such as ionospheric refraction, orbital accuracy, antenna phase center variation, signal multipath, and tropospheric delay have been reduced substantially, if not eliminated. In this study, seasonal effect on the GPS {{positioning accuracy}} is investigated. Taiwan is chosen for her unique geographic location and complex topography with abound water vapor in the air but spatially and seasonally dependent. The GPS data were collected from continuously operating reference stations by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), Central Weather Bureau (CWB), and Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan, and International GPS Service (IGS). The investigation of the relationship between variance of the vertical coordinate and change of climate is carried out by computing the GPS data collected in July and December 2003 to represent summer and winter, respectively. In addition, the comparison in results by using the Saastamoinen model and Hopfield model for correcting the influence of the atmospheric path delay is presented. It is found that the maximum difference in the monthly average <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> between the two months is about 20 mm. The corresponding daily maximum difference is 60 mm.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 To derive <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> on passive marks with cm-level accuracy, many current {{specifications}} {{require the}} collection and adjustment of long-duration, static Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sessions. To increase efficiency, a survey procedure that includes real-time kinematic vectors from a real-time GNSS network (RTN) was evaluated. Thirty different “hybrid” networks involving three to nine Network RTK (NRTK) vectors per mark and some static GNSS vectors were developed from surveys completed in Oregon and South Carolina. The variance-covariance matrices of the static and kinematic vectors were scaled by variance component estimation procedures to produce realistic error estimates for stochastic modeling. After least squares adjustment and formal random error propagation of the networks, the resulting <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> on the passive marks had network accuracies ranging from 0. 6 to 3. 6 cm (95 % confidence). These network accuracies reduced to 2 cm when using six or more NRTK observations per mark.

Practicing surveyors will therefore encounter Helmert orthometric heights computed from Global Positioning System (GPS) <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> and geoid heights determined from geoid models as their published vertical control coordinate, rather than adjusted orthometric heights determined by spirit leveling.

The local geoid models were based on Rapp's 360 degree x 360 order global geoid model determined from gravity measurements. Control data were adjusted by least squares to solve for the parameters in the local geoid model. Also studied were factors that affected the GPS-measured <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> differences. These included (1) comparing GPS differencing solutions, (2) standard error of GPS observations, (3) corrections for surface meteorological values, and (4) observation durations for GPS.

40|$|Hydrographic {{surveys are}} {{referenced}} vertically {{to a local}} water level “chart” datum. Conducting a survey relative to the ellipsoid dictates a datum transformation take place before the survey is used for current navigational products. Models that combine estimates for the tide, sea surface topography, the geoid, and the ellipsoid are often used to transform an ellipsoid referenced survey to a local water level datum. Regions covered by these vertical datum transformation models are limited and so would appear to constrain the areas where ellipsoid referenced surveys can be conducted. Because areas not covered by a vertical datum transformation model still must have a tide model to conduct a hydrographic survey, survey‐ time measurements of the ellipsoid to water level datum can be conducted through the vessel reference point. This measured separation is largely {{a function of the}} vessel <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> and the standard survey tide model and thus introduces limited additional uncertainty than is typical in a water level referenced survey.

Many applications require three-dimensional (3 -D) geo-spatial data with high spatial resolution and accuracy. One leading technology of the nationwide 3 -D mapping is airborne interferometric SAR mapping system due to its all-weather acquisition capability. Compared to other airborne mapping systems, the other advantage of the IFSAR mapping system is the efficiency. Flying {{at an altitude of}} 10 km, the Intermap IFSAR system can map an area of 10000 to 20000 km 2 per flight. The airborne IFSAR system consists of synthetic aperture radar sensor with two radar antennas and the GPS/INS components. The radar pulse signals are collected from two radar antennas and compressed by digital match filtering to extract the interferometric phase information. The GPS/INS system can provide highly accurate position and orientation information. Combining the SAR interferometric information and the GPS/INS navigation results the ortho-rectified radar image with 3 -D information can be obtained. Based on the GPS/INS components of the IFSAR system a new airborne gravity and geoid mapping system is developed by Intermap. The regional geoid undulation can be determined by the airborne gravity system and the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height</b> is transformed to the orthometric height directly from the integrated IFSAR system.

Methods of normal heights calculation by the means of <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> are presented in detail, as determined using the GNSS and height anomalies calculated from the GGM application. Apart from the above, numerical part of the paper evaluates normal height values and compares them to their conditionally accurate values at 1073 points with relatively uniform distribution over the entire territory of Serbia. Conditionally accurate values had been determined by the means of classical geodetic terrestrial methods.

40|$|In {{using any}} radiometric system, such as GPS, to {{determine}} terrestrial positions, {{it is necessary}} to account for the propagation delay of the neutral atmosphere (mainly the troposphere) if accuracies better than a few meters are needed. The zenith delay at sea level due to the hydrostatic (‘‘dry’’) component of the troposphere is about 2. 3 m. By definition, this contribution can be determined from local surface measurements of baro-metric pressure to millimeter accuracy, limited by the measured refractivity constants for dry air. The standard model of Saastamoinen (1972) is normally used to compute dry delays given surface pressure data. At a given altitude, the relationship between pressure and dry delay is linear; at sea level, a 1 mbar pressure change corresponds to a delay change of about 2. 3 mm. In the absence of local pressure data, global models for the dry delay can be reasonably accurate given latitude, <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height,</b> and day of year; pressure varies over a range of up to about ± 5 %, leading to comparable errors in the modeled dry delay. The non-hydrostatic (‘‘wet’’) delay is much more spatially and temporally variable. For this reason, models for the zenith wet delay (ZWD), even given highly accurate surface met data, are notoriously unre-liable. At sea level in temperate and tropical latitudes, the ZWD can reach 35 cm in summertime (i. e., 15 % of the dry delay). In wintertime, the ZWD outside the tropics can sometimes approach 0, especially at higher latitudes. If uncalibrated, unmodeled, or inaccurately cali-brated, tropospheric delays will induce an error in geo-detic height measurements of a similar or large...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of Global Navigation Satellite Sys-tem (GNSS) signals that are reflected off the surface, {{along with the}} reception of direct GNSS signals, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} monitor water level variations over land and ocean. The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the re-ceiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are re-flected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric prob-lem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are pro-posed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, osculating sphere or ellipsoid) and the consider-ation of topography likely to cause masking effects. Angular refraction effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cor-douan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the sec-ond one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflect-ing surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site con-figuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric differ-ence as WGS 84 <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height)</b> between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an osculating sphere or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite el-evation angles greater than 10 •, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 •. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 • and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for satellite elevation angles be-tween 5 and 10 •. These results are the means of the differ-ences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the satellite elevation angle is sampled over the day of simula-tion.

The correction of the angular re-fraction due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimet-ric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflect-ing surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface.

40|$|The {{detection}} of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals that are reflected off the surface, {{along with the}} reception of direct GNSS signals, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} monitor water level variations over land and ocean. The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the receiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are reflected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric problem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are proposed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, osculating sphere or ellipsoid) and the consideration of topography likely to cause masking effects. Angular refraction effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cordouan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the second one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflecting surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site configuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric difference as WGS 84 <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>height)</b> between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an osculating sphere or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 °, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 °. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for satellite elevation angles greater than 10 ° and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for satellite elevation angles between 5 and 10 °. These results are the means of the differences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the satellite elevation angle is sampled over the day of simulation.

Absolute and relative comparisons made between each geoid model over a 46. 2 km Global Positioning System (GPS) and digital levelling traverse, against all 116 control points (6, 670 possible baselines) and over Australian Height Datum (AHD) elevations greater than 200 m through to greater than 600 m show that AUSGeoid 98 is the superior geoid model for the conversion of GPS-derived <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> to AHD elevations on the Toowoomba Bypass project.

Conclusions made in this study are qualified by the fact that empirical validation of gravimetric geoid models on land does not provide an unequivocal assessment of the data, theories and techniques used to compute each geoid model due to the errors residing in the empirical geoid heights estimated to be ± 0. 0371 m evaluated at the 95...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} paper in a four-part series {{considering}} the fundamental question, “what does the word height really mean?” National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is embarking on a height modernization program in which, in the future, {{it will not be}} necessary for NGS to create new or maintain old orthometric height benchmarks. In their stead, NGS will publish measured <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> and computed Helmert orthometric heights for survey markers. Consequently, practicing surveyors will soon be confronted with coping with these changes and the differences between these types of height. Indeed, although “height’” is a commonly used word, an exact definition of {{it can be difficult to}} find. These articles will explore the various meanings of height as used in surveying and geodesy and present a precise definition that is based on the physics of gravitational potential, along with current best practices for using survey-grade GPS equipment for height measurement. Our goal is to review these basic concepts so that surveyors can avoid potential pitfalls that may be created by the new NGS height control era. The first paper reviews reference ellipsoids and mean sea level datums. The second paper reviews the physics of heights culminating in a simple development of the geoid and explains why mean sea level stations are not all at the same orthometric height. The third paper introduces geopotential numbers and dynamic heights, explains the correction needed to account for the non-parallelism of equipotential surfaces, and discusses how these corrections were used in NAVD 88.

40|$|This project {{evaluates the}} {{accuracy}} of GPS heights derived using the current New Zealand geoid model (NZGeoid 05) as compared to an empirically based spirit level network over a small study area(55 km x 50 km) in the South Island of New Zealand. It analyses the current New Zealand geoid model; NZGeoid 05, {{and the history of}} levelling datums in New Zealand with specific focus on the Lyttelton 1937 datum. It then uses GPS observations to derive <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> at known points that have precise level information, a calculation of geoid – ellipsoid separation values is performed and used to build a local geoid model. This is done mainly using the software package Grid Factory. The results of this research show that while there is a measureable difference between GPS derived heights and precise levelling heights, the differences are mostly within the specified accuracy of NZGeoid 05. As the two datums are independent interpretations of the equipotential surface, it is not surprising there are some differences. Further investigation shows that the reliability of the Lyttelton 1937 datum in terms of accurately representing the equipotential surface is now questionable due to poor initial definition, tectonic deformation and sea level change. This is a problem that will worsen with time. Another disadvantage of the Lyttelton 1937 datum is that it is orientated towards conventional technology and techniques. With the increasing popularity of modern GPS surveying, vertical determination methods using geoid models are becoming more common. The localised geoid model was successfully created. This proves that is it possible to build local geoid models. It was tested against NZGeoid 05 and EGM 08 to determine which produced height values that best correlated with the Lyttelton 1937 datum. The ProjectGeoid proved to provide the best solution. However, the evaluation of the model shows that it is not an independent interpretation of the equipotential surface but rather, it has given the Lyttelton interpretation a new expression. Because the Lyttelton interpretation of the equipotential surface is outdated and subject to continued degradation, this new interpretation will then not provide orthometic heights that truly represent actual MS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this project}} is {{to bridge the gap}} of {{understanding}} between the heights produced by Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and their relationship to the Australian Height Datum (AHD). This will be achieved by developing a local geoid model and testing it by utilising global positioning equipment, software, registered state control marks and geodetic surveying principles. The objective of the project is to improve future GPS derived AHD heights and to confirm AHD values of a sample of state control marks within the limitations of a sample area. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), notably GPS, have the ability to provide real time corrections and centimetre accuracy for surveying, civil engineering, property development, scientific and various other applications where position, both vertical and horizontal, is required. GPS offers an attractive alternative position determination tool, but only provided that it is sufficiently accurate for the application at hand. This project presents the results of utilising GPS, and software, to improve future GPS derived results of the AHD within the project area and confirm the stated values of AHD on state control marks within the limitations of the project area. GPS has established itself as a competitor to traditional surveying instruments such as the theodolite, electronic total stations, laser levels and spirit levels. GPS is a faster and more efficient tool for surveying applications, especially over large areas, when compared to the latter mentioned traditional instruments. Accurate position is the fundamental component of any built form project. Data is now commonly requested on the national mapping datum, the GDA 94 and the AHD. Deriving and transfening AHD heights using GPS is problematic. GPS users in Australia have had access to AUSGeoid 98, as a reference geoid, since November 1998. The primary application of a gravimetric geoid model is to convert GPS derived <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>heights</b> to elevations on a local height datum such as AHD. AUSGeoid 98 is a gravimetric geoid model developed, at two-arc minute spacing, to align AHD. AHD has deficiencies by virtue of its original establishment as an orthometric derived height system. This represents a considerable gap in the knowledge in the integrity of the AUSGeoid 98 's realisation of the AHD. The outcomes and results from this project can be used to complement the existing AUSGeoid 98 's geoid model and therefore increase the accuracy and realisation of AHD by GPS observations within the project area...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} used satellite positioning systems in Earth sciences is the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is a fast and efficient way of determining positions based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). It measures ellipsoidal heights h above the WGS 84 reference <b>ellipsoid.</b> However, orthometric <b>heights,</b> H, are the functional heights for mapping, engineering works, navigation and other geophysical applications. The orthometric heights are normally obtained through spirit levelling, {{which is a very}} tedious and expensive process. To exploit the capabilities of GPS for height purposes, the geoid should be determined in an area. The geoid is a closed and continuous level surface, which extends inside the solid body of the Earth and is best suited as a reference surface for a rigorous orthometric height system.|$|R

50|$|On a long voyage, spirit {{leveling}} indicates height variations {{even though}} the ship is always at sea level (neglecting the effects of tides). This is because GPS satellites, orbiting about {{the center of gravity}} of the Earth, can only measure heights relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid. To obtain one's geoidal height, a raw GPS reading must be corrected. Conversely, height determined by spirit leveling from a tidal measurement station, as in traditional land surveying, will always be geoidal height. Modern GPS receivers have a grid implemented inside where they obtain the geoid (e.g. EGM-96) height over the World Geodetic System (WGS) ellipsoid from the current position. Then they are able to correct the <b>height</b> above WGS <b>ellipsoid</b> to the <b>height</b> above WGS84 geoid. When height is not zero on a ship, the discrepancy is due to other factors such as ocean tides, atmospheric pressure (meteorological effects) and local sea surface topography.|$|R
