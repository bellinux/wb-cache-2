50|$|William <b>Gentles</b> {{was born}} in County Tyrone, Ireland, though the date is not known for certain. Records suggest that he was born some time between 1828 and 1835. He may be the William <b>Gentles</b> born September 30, 1828, the son of Robert and Sarah <b>Gentles.</b> William <b>Gentles</b> immigrated to the United States in 1850, {{arriving}} in New York City where {{he worked as a}} laborer for several years.|$|R

In June 1860, the company was transferred to Fort Laramie where <b>Gentles</b> completed his first enlistment and was discharged on April 1, 1861.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to assess the}} eVect of <b>gentling</b> on {{behaviour}} and meat quality of lambs. Thirty-two Comisana lambs were divided into four groups of eight animals: ER (ewe reared), AR (artiWcially reared) and the corresponding <b>gentled</b> groups ERG and ARG. The provision of human contacts stimulated <b>gentled</b> subjects to explore, whereas the proportion of idling subjects was reduced (P < 0. 10). At increasing age the number of subjects contacting the person increased in the <b>gentled</b> groups (P< 0. 05). Lambs left with their dams showed higher warm and cold carcass yields compared to artiWcially reared animals, although animals beneWting from both maternal care and <b>gentling,</b> had the highest dressing percentage (P< 0. 05). Values of pH declined more rapidly in meat from <b>gentled</b> animals than from ungentled subjects (P< 0. 05), b* and h values were higher in ARG than in AR group (P< 0. 05), whereas Warner-Bratzler shear force and hardness tended to be lower in <b>gentled</b> lambs (P < 0. 15). We conclude that human–animal relationship {{can play an important}} role in aVecting welfare, productive performances and meat quality of lambs, in particular when young subjects are prematurely separated from mothers...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} group size (individually versus 3 in a cage) and <b>gentling</b> on {{behaviour}} and blood constituents were studied in female rats. <b>Gentled</b> rats showed less freezing and/or escaping when approached in an objective handling test than non-gentled rats; {{the type of}} caging had no significant influence. In a small field, <b>gentled</b> rats displayed significantly more turning and standing upright, whereas these parameters did not differ between rats housed either individually or three in a cage. In both tests, <b>gentled</b> rats produced significantly less urine than did control rats. Neither caging nor <b>gentling</b> significantly influenced the group mean values and variance of masses of adrenals, spleen and thymus and plasma concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and corticosterone. Removal of a cage from the rack and getting out a rat caused increase in plasma concentrations of corticosterone in its remaining cage mates...|$|R

50|$|As a civilian, William <b>Gentles</b> {{apparently}} {{settled in}} St. Joseph, Missouri. But with the Civil War engulfing the nation, <b>Gentles</b> again enlisted, {{this time in}} the 25th Regular Missouri Volunteers, which later became the 1st Regiment of Missouri Engineers. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Pilot Knob on September 27, 1862. <b>Gentles</b> completed his enlistment in 1864 and re-enlisted as a veteran volunteer. He was mustered out on July 22, 1865 in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and <b>gentle,</b> with an earth tone, while the camera movement was <b>gentle</b> as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
