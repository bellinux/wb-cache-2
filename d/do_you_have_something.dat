5000|$|Q: “What unusual thing <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> called 'the gift of tongues'?” ...|$|R
60|$|Bessie. Oh, yes. I <b>did</b> see <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> {{under your}} coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ambrose, <b>does</b> {{that mean}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> {{to keep a}} secret from us?" [...] asked Naomi, {{approaching}} her lover with a smile. [...] "Is Silas ordered to hold his tongue?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond smiled. [...] "I saw you," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I wasn't {{quite sure}} that another of my guests did not <b>do</b> so, too. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to say to me." ...|$|R

40|$|Six of {{the short}} dietary {{questions}} used in the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (see box below) were evaluated for relative validity both directly and indirectly and for consistency, by documenting the differences in mean intakes of foods and nutrients as measured on the 24 -hour recall, between groups with different responses to the short questions. 1. Including snacks, how many times <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to eat in a day including evenings? 2. How many days per week <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to eat for breakfast? 3. In the last 12 months, were there any times that you ran out of food and couldn’t afford to buy more? 4. What type of milk <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually consume? 5. How many serves of vegetables <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually eat each day? (a serve = 1 / 2 cup cooked vegetables or 1 cup of salad vegetables) 6. How many serves of fruit <b>do</b> <b>you</b> usually eat each day? (a serve = 1 medium piece or 2 small pieces of fruit or 1 cup of diced pieces) These comparisons were made {{for males and females}} overall and for population sub-groups of interest including: age, socio-economic disadvantage, region of residence, country of birth, and BMI category. Several limitations to this evaluation {{of the short}} questions, as discussed in the report, need to be kept in mind including: · The method for comparison available (24 -hour recall) was not ideal (gold standard); as it measures yesterday’s intake. This limitation was overcome by examining only mean differences between groups of respondents, since mean intake for a group can provide a reasonable approximation for ‘usual’ intake. · The need to define and identify, post-hoc, from the 24 -hour recall the number of eating occasions, and occasions identified by the respondents as breakfast. · Predetermined response categories for some of the questions effectively limited the number of categories available for evaluation. · Other foods and nutrients, not selected for this evaluation, may have an indirect relationship with the question, and might have shown stronger and more consistent responses. · The number of responses in some categories of the short questions eg for food security may have been too small to detect significant differences between population sub-groups. · No information was available to examine the validity of these questions for detecting differences over time (establishing trends) in food habits and indicators of selected nutrient intakes. By contrast, the strength of this evaluation was its very large sample size, (atypical of most validation studies of dietary assessment) and thus, the opportunity to investigate question performance in a range of broad population sub-groups compared with a well-conducted, quantified survey of intakes. The results of the evaluation are summarised below for each of the questions and specific recommendations for future testing, modifications and use provided for each question. The report concludes with some general recommendations for the further development and evaluation of short dietary questions...|$|R
60|$|Next to my Johnsoniana are my Gibbons--two editions, if you please, for my old {{complete}} {{one being}} somewhat crabbed {{in the print}} I could not resist getting a set of Bury's new six-volume presentment of the History. In reading that book you don't want to be handicapped in any way. You want fair type, clear paper, and a light volume. You are not to read it lightly, but with some earnestness of purpose and keenness for knowledge, with a classical atlas at your elbow and a note-book hard by, taking easy stages and harking back {{every now and then}} to keep your grip of the past and to link it up with what follows. There are no thrills in it. You won't be kept out of your bed at night, nor will you forget your appointments during the day, but you will feel a certain sedate pleasure in the doing of it, and when it is <b>done</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> gained <b>something</b> which <b>you</b> can never lose--something solid, something definite, something that will make you broader and deeper than before.|$|R
6000|$|I do not {{remember}} what else he talked of, though once I remembered it with what I believed an ineffaceable distinctness. I set nothing of it down at the time; I was too busy with the letters I was writing for a Cincinnati paper; and I was severely bent upon keeping all personalities out of them. This was very well, but I could wish now that I had transgressed {{at least so far}} as to report {{some of the things that}} Lowell said; for the paper did not print my letters, and it would have been perfectly safe, and very useful for the present purpose. But perhaps he did not say anything very memorable; to <b>do</b> that <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> <b>something</b> positive in your listener; and I was the mere response, the hollow echo, that youth must be in like circumstances. I was all the time afraid of wearing my welcome out, and I hurried to go when I would so gladly have staid. I do {{not remember}} where I meant to go, or why he should have undertaken to show me the way across-lots, but this was what he did; and when we came to a fence, which I clambered gracelessly over, he put his hands on the top, and tried to take it at a bound. He tried twice, and then laughed at his failure, but not with any great pleasure, and he was not content till a third trial carried him across. Then he said, [...] "I commonly do that the first time," [...] as if it were a frequent habit with him, while I remained discreetly silent, and for that moment at least felt myself the elder of the man who had so much of the boy in him. He had, indeed, much of the boy in him to the last, and he parted with each hour of his youth reluctantly, pathetically.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{more could}} you do!' sneered Quilp, 'couldn't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> less? Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do,</b> without {{appearing}} in your favourite {{part of the}} crocodile, you minx?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That was {{the name}} I said. You seem to know it. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to say against the lady. Eh? <b>Have</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you?</b> I warn you to be careful. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know of Miss Parker? Speak!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel said, [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> made up {{that will}} <b>do.</b> Won't <b>you</b> {{let me see}} what <b>you</b> <b>have?</b> Certainly the dress you wore at the concert became you well." ...|$|R
