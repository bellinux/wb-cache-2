60|$|I made no answer, but {{turning to}} Pomona, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> this all meant.|$|E
60|$|Not {{wishing to}} pursue this subject, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> her father was doing with the metal plates.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, she's amazing--she's amazing," [...] I repeated; [...] "but so are you." [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she {{had said}} to my boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{does she}} come into Klondike, all alone, {{with plenty of}} money? I do not know. Next day <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> She laugh and says: 'Sitka Charley, that is none of your business. I give you one {{thousand}} dollars take me to Dawson. That only is your business.' Next day after that <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> is <b>her</b> name. She laugh, then she says, 'Mary Jones, that is my name.' I do not know her name, but I know {{all the time that}} Mary Jones is not her name.|$|R
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} that <b>I</b> {{could scarcely}} <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "When Mrs. Charpentier paused," [...] {{the detective}} continued, [...] "I {{saw that the}} whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye {{in a way which}} I always found {{effective}} with women, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> at <b>what</b> hour <b>her</b> son returned.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{could be}} done, for I was stirred by her tears, and the dread of evil crept {{from her to}} me as shadows creep from the valley to the mountain.|$|E
6000|$|She {{led the way}} to {{a marble}} block covered with {{worn-out}} carvings and almost buried in the debris. This, she said, was the altar of offerings. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> offerings, and she replied with a smile: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} gun very willingly,--although I {{did not think}} that Corny would injure any birds with it,--but <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thought about alligators. She {{certainly}} had not supposed that they were killed for food.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> am <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{she thinks}} {{will become of}} the work if she is to go and take her {{pleasure}} whenever she likes. She talks of working extra; but supposing she had a headache, she'd be sorry she had thrown away her time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. She {{vowed that}} she had seen enough of princes, who were murderers and liars, all of them; and that what she desired was one of good birth, no more, brave, honest, and not a fool. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her,</b> too, <b>what</b> she would have him like to look upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am gazing round me, {{with the}} horror {{that the place}} inspires, when Goblin {{clutches}} me by the wrist, and lays, not her skinny finger, but the handle of a key, upon her lip. She invites me, with a jerk, to follow her. I do so. She leads me out into a room adjoining--a rugged room, with a funnel-shaped, contracting roof, open at the top, to the bright day. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> it is. She folds her arms, leers hideously, and stares. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> again. She glances round, to see that all the little company are there; sits down upon a mound of stones; throws up her arms, and yells out, like a fiend, 'La Salle de la Question!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I--on the whole. And then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> about woman. And {{then she}} said with a woman it wasn't fear, it was just boredom. A woman is like a violinist: any fiddle, any {{instrument}} rather than empty hands and no tune going." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then again, after telling Selina what I {{heard in}} the study, and how roughly Philip had spoken to me afterward, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thought of it. She made an incomprehensible reply: [...] "My sweet child, I mustn't think of it--I am too fond of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now we journeyed back to Memphis {{with all}} these tidings and made report to Seti. When Merapi heard them she went half mad, weeping and {{wringing}} her hands. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she feared. She answered death, which was near to all of us. I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Presty {{listened with}} an {{appearance}} of the deepest interest. [...] "Quite a novelty {{in the way of}} a governess," [...] she said. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>what</b> <b>her</b> name is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, Olaf. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> of <b>what</b> use {{it was to}} be an Empress if {{she could}} not please her own heart in this matter of a husband, which is one {{important}} to a woman. I said also, as for such fears, that a secret marriage might be thought of, which is an honest business that could be declared when occasion came." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, before <b>I</b> could <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant, {{the great}} door slowly {{opened and the}} guest-master stood before us. She passed him with a silent salutation and {{vanished}} {{on her way to}} the chapel; and, though I watched her longingly, I dared not follow. Then, declining Father Bernard's invitation to go to his room and rest, I turned away from the door and wandered into the grounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] she said, [...] "but were I you, I should {{watch this}} man Benson--especially {{when he is}} in charge." [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant, {{thinking}} I could see the influence of von Schoenvorts raising a suspicion against {{one of my most}} trusted men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I recall another {{event was}} when some caller dropped {{in and we}} had drifted into a {{discussion}} about ghosts and the like--and I've no doubt we all talked some delicious nonsense. Miriam said nothing at the time, but when we were alone <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she thought of it.|$|E
60|$|We all enjoyed our {{turnovers}} except Sara Ray. She ate hers but {{she knew}} she should not have done so. Her mother did not approve of snacks between meals, or of jam turnovers at any time. Once, when Sara was in a brown study, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she was thinking of.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> never shall <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> <b>What's</b> the use {{of beating}} about the bush, aunt? <b>I</b> never shall <b>ask</b> her; and if I did, she wouldn't have me. If {{you want to make}} Sophie Mellerby your niece, Jack's your game." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “She {{would often}} {{come into my}} Study to me, and when <b>I</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she would have, she would reply, Nothing, My Dear, but to ask thee how thou dost, and see if thou wantest any thing; and then with an endearing Smile would say, Dost thou love me? To which when I replied, Most dearly; I know it abundantly, would she answer, to my Comfort, but I love to hear thee tell me so.” ...|$|R
60|$|My {{door opened}} again, and J. Mellows's {{representative}} came back. <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could have for dinner, and she now {{returned with the}} counter question, what would I like? As the Dolphin stood possessed of nothing that I do like, I was fain to yield to {{the suggestion of a}} duck, which I don't like. J. Mellows's representative was a mournful young woman with eye susceptible of guidance, and one uncontrollable eye; which latter, seeming to wander in quest of stage-coaches, deepened the melancholy in which the Dolphin was steeped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she's {{undoubtedly}} gymnastic in the externals of music, but {{the intrinsic}} spirit {{of music is}} unguessed by her. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> music meant to her--you know I'm always curious to know that particular thing; {{and she did not}} know what it meant to her, except that she adored it, that it was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Schomberg jerked Heyst's note, twisted like a pipe-light, {{into my lap}} while I {{sat there}} unsuspecting," [...] Davidson went on. [...] "Directly I had {{recovered}} my senses, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> on earth {{she had to do}} with it that Heyst should leave it with her. And then, behaving like a painted image rather than a live woman, she whispered, just loud enough for me to hear: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{might have}} been mistaken, but I thought Mrs. Rymer {{answered}} me in no very friendly way. Resolved to judge for myself, I entered the lodge, and found my poor little pupil sitting in a corner, crying. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was the matter, the excuse of a [...] "bad headache" [...] was the only reply that I received. The natures of young girls are a hopeless puzzle to me. Susan seemed, for some reason which {{it was impossible to}} understand, to be afraid to look at me.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{understand}} the necessity for such an enormous force of armed men about a spot so surrounded by mystery and superstition that not a soul upon Barsoom would have dared to approach it even had they known its exact location. <b>I</b> questioned Thuvia, <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> enemies the therns could fear in their impregnable fortress.|$|R
60|$|Here she run me aground again, for <b>I</b> durst not <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> was Roxana's real name, lest she {{had really}} {{dealt with the}} devil, and had boldly given my own name in for answer; so that I was still more and more afraid that the girl had really gotten the secret somewhere or other; though I could not imagine neither how that could be.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} I {{want to know if}} she looks favorably upon me," [...] said Lawrence Croft to himself, [...] "for when I wish to {{discover}} that, <b>I</b> shall simply <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> wish now to know is whether, or not, she considers me at all as a lover. There surely must be something I can say which will give me a clew." [...] "The Virginians, as a rule," [...] he replied, [...] "are certainly a very well-grown and vigorous race." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was one day on my travels,' {{says the}} Black Thief, 'and I came {{into a large}} forest, where I wandered a long time, and could {{not get out of}} it. At length I came to a large castle, and fatigue obliged me to call in the same, where I found a young woman and a child sitting on her knee, and she crying. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> made her cry, and where the lord of the castle was, for I {{wondered}} greatly that I saw no stir of servants or any person about the place.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she {{considered}} to be the main underlying cause of this misery. She answered that she thought it was due 'to the people flocking from the country to the city,' thereby confirming an opinion that I have long held and advanced. She added that the overcrowding in the district was terrible, the regulations of the Public Health Authorities designed to check it being 'a dead letter.' In one case with which she had to do, a father, mother, and nine children lived in a room that measured 9 ft. by 9 ft., and the baby came into the world with the children looking on! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{direction}} in which she turned prevented her from seeing me. She was quite unaware that I had discovered her; and I have said nothing about it since. But I noticed something unusual {{in the manner in}} which her watch-chain was hanging, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> o'clock it was. She said, [...] "You have got your own watch." [...] I told her my watch had stopped. [...] "So has mine," [...] she said. There is no doubt about it now; she has pawned her watch. What for? She lives here for nothing, and she has not had a new dress since I have known her. Why does she want money? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{walked on}} through a {{pleasant}} meadow, where a pretty {{little girl was}} looking sadly up at a row of sheep's tails hung on a tree. I also saw a little boy in blue, asleep by a haycock; and another boy taking aim at a cock-sparrow, who clapped his wings and flew away. Presently I saw two more little girls: one sat by a fire warming her toes; and, when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>what</b> <b>her</b> name was, she said pleasantly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She came in {{here with}} a ring I dropped in my bed-room," [...] Mr. Franklin went on. [...] "When I had thanked her, of course I {{expected}} her to go. Instead of that, she stood opposite {{to me at the}} table, looking at me in the oddest manner--half frightened, and half familiar--I couldn't make it out. 'This is a strange thing about the Diamond, sir,' she said, in a curiously sudden, headlong way. I said, 'Yes, it was,' and wondered what was coming next. Upon my honour, Betteredge, I think she must be wrong in the head! She said, 'They will never find the Diamond, sir, will they? No! nor the person who took it--I'll answer for that.' She actually nodded and smiled at me! Before <b>I</b> could <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she meant, we heard your step outside. I suppose she was afraid of your catching her here. At any rate, she changed colour, and left the room. What on earth does it mean?" ...|$|R
60|$|If <b>I</b> {{had only}} <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{associations}} she connected with my Christian name--if I had only persuaded {{her to speak}} in the briefest and most guarded terms of her past life--the barrier between us, which the change in our names and the lapse of ten years had raised, must have been broken down; the recognition must have followed. But I never even thought of it; and for this simple reason--I {{was in love with}} her. The purely selfish idea of winning my way to her favorable regard by taking instant advantage of the new interest that I had awakened in her was the one idea which occurred to my mind.|$|R
