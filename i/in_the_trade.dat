40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the degree to}} which the learning by doing externality [LBD] calls for an undervalued exchange rate, a policy suggested by recent empirical studies which concluded that mildly undervalued real exchange rate may enhance growth. We obtain mixed results. For an economy where LBD externality operates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector, real exchange rate undervaluation may be used in order to internalize this externality, if the LBD calls for subsidizing employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector. Yet, we also find that these results are not robust to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nature of the LBD externality. If the LBD externality is embodied <b>in</b> aggregate investment, <b>the</b> optimal policy calls for subsidizing the cost of capital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector, and there is no room for undervalued exchange rate policy. In addition, a deliberate undervaluation by means of hoarding reserves may backfire if the needed sterilization would increase the cost of investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector. ...|$|R

Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south.
