500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the <b>friends</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
2500|$|By 2006, Dobson {{returned}} to the studio to finish her second album, Sunday Love. [...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least it got out there to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson. [...] "But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, I went back to the studio, got people that I knew, <b>friends</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew, and I started again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Bennett {{remained}} with the Beaneaters {{even though he}} had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. [...] As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. [...] Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players' League: [...] "I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my <b>friends</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not join them, so I {{remained with}} the Boston Club. When I went into the Brotherhood it was a protective order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of their own." ...|$|E

60|$|It means, my <b>friend,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see our {{position}} toward Romayne {{in a new}} light. Forgive me, if I say no more for the present. I prefer to be silent, until my audacity is justified by events.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{fathers and}} mothers," [...] said the attorney, [...] "never {{really know what}} the young ones are after. Don't mention it just at present, Runciman. You are such an old <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't help telling you." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{closed the}} door and gesticulated. [...] "No! Of course you didn't. Why ain't you out with some of your swell <b>friends</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ain't good enough to meet, shopping, and buying dresses, and God knows what--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had none}} to suggest; which made his {{question}} seem to himself silly {{as well as}} brutal. [...] "You've a great many <b>friends</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't know. You've a whole past from which I was perversely excluded." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are now twenty-seven or eight," [...] {{said the}} Warden, [...] "and were {{four years old}} when you first knew him. He might now be sixty-five.

6000|$|... "It's {{time to be}} moving," [...] {{said his}} comrade with a laugh. [...] "I would have roused you before, but you seemed to be so busily engaged with some <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn't the heart to part you sooner." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then {{the other}} looked at Robin and winked cunningly. Quoth he, [...] "I tell thee, <b>friend,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have nigh {{as much by}} me as thou hast, but it is hidden so that never a knave in Sherwood could find it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But indeed I do, and isn't it natural? If {{you will}} {{remember}} that your only brother is the oldest <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have in the world, {{how can it be}} otherwise? Of course he is much older than me, and very much older than you, Miss Mackenzie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{the oldest}} and dearest <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have in the world, sir," [...] I answered.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I went on, [...] "we do, indeed"; {{and again}} I smiled benignly, as I uttered that amazing lie.
