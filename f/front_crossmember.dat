2500|$|Toyota took {{measures}} {{to reduce the}} weight of this new model. Aluminium {{was used for the}} hood, targa top (when fitted), <b>front</b> <b>crossmember,</b> oil and transmission pans, and the suspension upper A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbo, the car was at least [...] lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of [...] The Sport Roof added [...] while the automatic transmission added [...] It had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed [...] with a manual transmission while the automatic added another [...] Weight distribution was 53% front/47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the spartan Mazda RX-7 and all aluminium bodied Acura/Honda NSX, but it was lighter than the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4.|$|E
50|$|The {{modifications}} {{were focused}} on sharper handling and ride improvements. STI flexible tower bar, Bilstein inverted struts with stiffer springs, front flexible low stiffeners, and rear pillow-ball, and reinforced <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> made the 2.5GT tS has more rigidity and better steering feedback.|$|E
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> (steering, {{suspension}} and engine mounting) assembly from the HA became {{a very popular}} item for DIY hot rod builders in the UK, due to its simple self-contained mechanics, similar to older designs such as those from the 1930s, and ability to accommodate much larger engines within its span. The assembly featured a double wishbone/vertical telescopic dampers suspension design in combination with a transverse leaf spring attached to the <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> at its centre position and the entire unit could be removed and adapted to another vehicle. (For similar reasons the Jaguar IRS assembly was often used {{at the rear of}} these custom cars). The Viva's rear suspension made do with conventional longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs and telescopic dampers.|$|E
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} comprised double wishbones and {{coil springs}} {{attached to a}} <b>front</b> axle <b>crossmember.</b> An anti-roll bar linked the two lower wishbones. [...] A similar arrangement was later used on the Vauxhall Viva.|$|R
50|$|Racing car kits {{were also}} produced, {{consisting}} {{of this type}} of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections. The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ, with the <b>front</b> suspension <b>crossmember</b> and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body.|$|R
5000|$|Changes include {{increased}} {{engine performance}} (from Continental GT Speed), a ZF eight-speed transmission, a redesigned {{body with a}} lower, wider appearance with sharp lines and gently curvaceous surfaces; a new wing vent at the front fenders; new body structure including reinforcement to the B-posts, sills and <b>front</b> <b>crossmembers</b> combined with deformable components in the floorpan for optimal load transfer; a deployable aluminium bonnet that includes both new reinforcement panels and deformation elements; 600 new interior parts, lightweight acoustic underfloor panels, side glazing and both front and rear screens made in acoustic glass; a heating and ventilation system with a new Thermostatic Expansion Valve (with optional Climate Boost function), new 19" [...] tyres with a 12% relative increase in sidewall height, suspension spring rates are softened front and rear by 10% and 13% respectively, anti-roll bars softened by 13% and 15% to improve single wheel impact absorption, suspension lever bushes all-round softened by at least 25% for reduced road noise and vibration, revised continuous damping control (CDC),and new 19-inch Classic wheels in bright-painted or diamond turned finishes (optional 20-inch five-spoke, 21-inch six-spoke and 21-inch ten-spoke wheels).Flying Spur W12 Mulliner includes five additional hides, expanding the number of available shades to 17, five further wood veneers choices, 21-inch five-spoke two-piece alloy wheels, Mulliner name at treadplates and the chrome details on the wing vent, diamond-quilted seats and door panels with perforated hides, drilled alloy sports pedals and a knurled sports gear lever.|$|R
50|$|The M20 {{truck had}} a riveted ladder frame with three beam axles, the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. The wheelbase was 179 in, measured from the {{centerline of the}} front axle to the centerline of rear bogie. A pintle hitch of 115,000 lb capacity was mounted on the rear frame crossmember; another pintle hitch was mounted on the <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> for positioning the trailer.|$|E
50|$|The R3 {{version was}} {{introduced}} for the 2009 year model. The R3 package added slightly improved suspension over the base model by adding Bilstein shock absorbers and a foam filled <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> to improve rigidity. The R3 also came with 19-inch forged aluminum-alloy wheels and high performance tires. On the exterior, the R3 had a different, lower front bumper sporting a splitter, lower side sills, {{and a standard}} rear spoiler. There {{is a pair of}} special Recaro seats up front, along with the same 300-watt Bose audio system, Bluetooth, and Mazda advanced keyless entry and start system. No electric sunroof was offered in the R3 model.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{extended}} {{back into}} the vehicle's passenger compartment, and was covered by a removable cowling. The vehicle thus had a very short bonnet, giving it its distinctive look. This configuration meant that the driver and passenger were travelling with their feet alongside the engine, but allowed a good proportion of the vehicle's overall length {{to be used for}} its payload. Access to the engine for routine checks was via the tiny bonnet flap, or the interior cowl. For major overhaul of the engine, the front panel containing the headlights and grille, and the chassis <b>front</b> <b>crossmember</b> had to be completely removed. A popular aftermarket conversion of the time was the use of the Perkins 4/99 diesel engine. This was low on power (40 bhp) but was capable of superior fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|The Pacer became {{only the}} second American car after the Ford Pinto in {{production}} cars in the U.S. to feature rack-and-pinion steering. The system was mounted low at the <b>front</b> of the <b>crossmember.</b> The body was designed with the aim that structural lines protected it from hit damage, and AMC engineers claimed that they succeeded in more than 50% of the car surface.|$|R
50|$|The Beetle is {{also used}} {{as the basis for the}} Formula Vee open-wheel racing category: specifically, the <b>front</b> {{suspension}} <b>crossmember</b> assembly (the shock absorber mounts are sometimes removed, depending on regulations in the class), and the engine and transaxle assembly (usually the earlier swing-axle type, not the later double-jointed axle).In original 1,200 cc Formula Vee spec, upgrades to the cars would only be allowed sparsely, so that the wheels, tires and engines didn't differ very much from the original Beetle. At the end of the 1960s, Vee Beetle engine output on a single carburetor would reach up to 70 BHP; top speeds would gradually rise to nearly 200 km/h. In this configuration, FV would become one of the most popular entry-level motorsports classes of its time.|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Endeavor is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’s PS platform. It uses RISE unibody {{structure}} that employs extensive reinforcement for additional passenger {{protection in the}} event of a collision. Robust front subframe members are connected with a dash panel crossmember and a strong, <b>front</b> steel <b>crossmember</b> to help create a rigid, boxed front subframe area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel crossmembers across the floor also help absorb side impact energy and help protect occupants. Extensive use of energy absorbing materials appear on the interior and headliner and are used to cover the inside of the front center and rear pillars and help reduce the possibility of injury during a collision.|$|R
50|$|Tänak scored {{his first}} WRC {{points in the}} 2011 Rally Mexico, and {{finished}} 3rd in SWRC. In Italy he collected his first class win with an outstanding performance. He continued to impress in Greece, as he was leading after the first day, but rolled his car on {{the first stage of}} the second day, and had to retire. In Finland he finished 3rd, and looked like he has only mathematical chances of winning the title. But with victories in Germany and France, he put himself back into title contention, arriving in Spain only 3 points behind leader Juho Hänninen. However, he hit a rock on the first stage, breaking his Fiesta S2000's <b>front</b> <b>crossmember,</b> and had to restart under SupeRally rules, meaning that he basically lost all of his chances of becoming the champion. He finished the event sixth in SWRC, and runner-up to Hänninen in the championship standings.|$|E
50|$|Toyota took {{measures}} {{to reduce the}} weight of this new model. Aluminium {{was used for the}} hood, targa top (when fitted), <b>front</b> <b>crossmember,</b> oil and transmission pans, and the suspension upper A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibers, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tires, and an additional turbo, the car was at least 200 lb lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of 3210 lb. The Sport Roof added 40 lb while the automatic transmission added 55 lb. It had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed 3450 lb with a manual transmission while the automatic added another 10 lb. Weight distribution was 53% front/47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the spartan Mazda RX-7 and all aluminium bodied Acura/Honda NSX, but it was lighter than the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4.|$|E
50|$|The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant is {{also built}} upon Mitsubishi’ PS platform. It uses a {{straight}} frame-rail RISE design body that absorbs and disperses {{energy in the}} event of a collision and offers improved structural rigidity to prevent longitudinal twisting. It features integrated, energy absorbing crumple zones and strategically applied reinforcements at key body points and steel side impact door beams. Every opening in the body, including doors, boot and engine compartment, is reinforced to help resist the bending and twisting forces. The body employs higher tensile strength steel panels to reduce body weight and increase body rigidity. Robust front subframe members are connected with a dash panel <b>crossmember</b> and strong, <b>front</b> steel <b>crossmember</b> to help create a rigid boxed section front subframe area. Reinforced side sill members also help disperse energy {{in the event of}} a collision. High-strength steel cross members across the floor absorb side impact energy.|$|R
5000|$|The 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer {{is built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). The RISE body structure disperses energy loads during side and rear crashes and controls distortion, enhancing occupant protection and also protecting the fuel system during a rear impact. The highly rigid structure makes extensive use of high-tension steel. It features straight [...] "front side members" [...] with an octagonal [...] "cross-section" [...] and a three-leg support structure, as well as increased application of both high-strength (590Mpa) and ultra-high strength (980MPa) steel. Compared to the previous-generation Lancer, torsional rigidity has been increased by 56 percent, and bending rigidity is up by 50 percent. The side pillars, roof joints and cross-car structure increase collision protection. A collapsible <b>front</b> chassis <b>crossmember</b> and a device to help prevent brake-pedal retraction during a collision contribute to better impact energy management. The pedestrian impact protection has also been increased, with new shock-absorbing hood, cowl and fender structures and shock-absorbing hood hinges.|$|R
5000|$|A new 2.2-liter X22SE engine {{built by}} Holden in Australia {{served as the}} base engine. Isuzu also offered the [...] 6VD1 V6 that carried 214 lbft Nm of torque at 3000 rpm. Fuel {{consumption}} is an estimated 22 mpg highway. From a technical prospective, the Rodeo and Amigo were built with a rigid frame that has eight <b>crossmembers.</b> <b>Front</b> suspension has independent lower and upper arms, with a solid rear axle. The Rodeo and Amigo 4WD models came with a modified Dana 44 rear axle and push-button four-wheel drive. They also had a traditional floor mounted lever for switching from high- to low-range. Underneath, both vehicles came with protective skid plates as a standard feature.|$|R
