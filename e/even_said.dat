5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{troubles}} in the south-east spread north, slowed {{by the poor}} communication links of medieval England. In Leicester, where John of Gaunt had a substantial castle, warnings arrived of a force of rebels advancing on the city from Lincolnshire, who were intent on destroying the castle and its contents. The mayor and the town mobilised their defences, including a local militia, but the rebels never arrived. John of Gaunt was in Berwick when word reached him on 17 June of the revolt. Not knowing that Wat Tyler had by now been killed, John of Gaunt placed his castles in Yorkshire and Wales on alert. Fresh rumours, many of them incorrect, continued to arrive in Berwick, suggesting widespread rebellions across the west and east of England and the looting of the ducal household in Leicester; rebel units were <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to be hunting for the Duke himself. Gaunt began to march to Bamburgh Castle, but then changed course and diverted north into Scotland, only returning south once the fighting was over.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that Democritus's father was from a noble family and so wealthy that he {{received}} Xerxes on his march through Abdera.

25|$|His {{works are}} {{sometimes}} <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to {{have contributed to}} the modern negative connotations of the words politics and politician, and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that Old Nick became an English term for the Devil. More obviously, the adjective Machiavellian became a pejorative term describing someone who aims to deceive and manipulate others for personal advantage. Machiavellianism also remains a popular term used in speeches and journalism; while in psychology, it denotes a personality type.|$|E
25|$|Between 1613 and 1622 the gun {{was used}} and {{was found to be}} capable of firing a 10lb (4.5kg) ball a {{distance}} of 2000 yards (1.8km). Before the English Civil War it guarded the cliffs of Dover and propaganda of the time claimed it could fire a 12lb ball seven miles. Some <b>even</b> <b>said</b> its shot could reach France if {{the gun was}} properly maintained though this is an exaggeration; tests done in the 1970s with similar basilisks have a more realistic range of 1200 yards with a 10lb ball.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Selleck {{played the}} lead role of Murray in a Broadway revival of Herb Gardner's comedic play A Thousand Clowns. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly {{negative}} about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of Jason Robards, Jr., who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character {{on the stage and}} in a movie version. (It remains the role with which Robards is most identified.) Playwright Gardner, however, actually preferred Selleck to Robards in the part, and <b>even</b> <b>said</b> that Selleck was the way he had always envisioned Murray.|$|E
25|$|He also {{tended to}} engage in {{sledging}} of opposition batsmen and teams, though it didn't always pay off. Before the 2005 Ashes series he predicted a 5–0 whitewash for Australia, and <b>even</b> <b>said</b> that if England won the Ashes {{he would return to}} Australia by boat, but England prevailed 2–1. However, this did not dissuade him from making a similar 5–0 prediction for the next Ashes series, in Australia in 2006/07 {{which turned out to be}} true. He finished his career as the most successful Test fast-bowler and 3rd highest Test wicket taker. However his Test wicket haul was surpassed by Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble during India's tour of England 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1865 at age 18, Nechayev {{moved to}} Moscow, {{where he worked}} for the {{historian}} Mikhael Pogodin. A year later, he moved to St. Petersburg, passed a teacher's exam and began teaching at a parish school. From September 1868, Nechayev attended lectures at St. Petersburg University (as an auditor, he was never enrolled) and became acquainted with the subversive Russian literature of the Decembrists, the Petrashevsky Circle, and Mikhail Bakunin, among others, as well as the growing student unrest at the university. Nechaev was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to have slept on bare wood and lived on black bread in imitation of Rakhmetov, the ascetic revolutionary in Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?.|$|E

25|$|The Goga cabinet {{ended when}} the {{tentative}} rapprochement between Goga and Codreanu prompted Carol {{to overthrow the}} democratic system and proclaim his own authoritarian regime (see 1938 Constitution of Romania, National Renaissance Front). The deposed Premier died in 1938, and Antonescu remained {{a close friend of}} his widow, Veturia Goga. By that time, revising his earlier stance, Antonescu had also built a close relationship with Codreanu, and was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to have become his confidant. On Carol's request, he had earlier asked the Guard's leader to consider an alliance with the king, which Codreanu promptly refused in favor of negotiations with Goga, coupled with claims that he was not interested in political battles (an attitude supposedly induced by Antonescu himself).|$|E
25|$|Gikai's return {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of {{what is known as the}} sandai sōron, a schism that would split Dōgen's community into multiple competing factions. Because Gikai had an interest in architecture and had recorded temple constructions during his time in China, Ejō allowed him to take control of the ongoing building projects at Eihei-ji. In 1267, Ejō had become ill and decided to retire as abbot. He moved out of Eihei-ji to a nearby location, but continued to be considered the tōdōi, a rank for retired abbots. Two monks, Bussō and Dōson, are <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to have attained enlightenment under him during his stay outside the temple. At any rate, his health had improved within a short time of leaving Eihei-ji.|$|E
25|$|To {{prove their}} allegation, the {{opposing}} Democratic Party, {{along with the}} police and Central Election Assistance Commission, swooped {{in the house where}} the alleged agent of NIS has resided. From there, the 29-year-old female agent, later known as Ha-Young Kim, who was running an illegal online election campaign operation such as spreading slanderous postings about the opposing candidate had locked herself in. The police could not force to enter the house and the standoff lasted for three days, provoking a tense political standoff. The opposition accused the intelligence service of blocking an investigation. Park and her party accused the opposition of harassing the woman. Park <b>even</b> <b>said</b> the standoff of the self lock-in was a violation against a female right in the presidential candidate debate that took place three days before the election.|$|E

25|$|From {{as early}} as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the River Thames in London. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to {{prohibit}} the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> that the river “smells like death.” As Britain was the first country to industrialize, {{it was also the}} first to experience the disastrous consequences of major urbanisation and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions. During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of cholera epidemics. Proposals to modernise the sewerage system had been made during 1856, but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.|$|E
25|$|The Zohar, one of {{the primary}} sources of Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism), {{attributes}} holiness to the beard, and strongly discourages its removal, declaring that even the shortening of a beard by scissors is a great sin; it was <b>even</b> <b>said</b> that Isaac Luria, a significant figure in the history of Kabbalistic mysticism, meticulously avoided touching his beard, lest he should accidentally cause hairs to drop from it. Kabbalistic teachings gradually spread into Slavonic regions, and consequently beard trimming was discouraged in these areas, even if it involved scissors; it was the Hasidic Jews who more closely followed Kabbalistic practices than Jews of a Lithuanian or Misnagdish background, and thus it became the Hasidic Jews who are known for the distinctive traditional practice of growing their beards. However, in Italy, shaving the beard was so popular that even the Italian followers of Kabbalah did it; an Italian Kabbalist even went to the extent of arguing that beard shaving was only prohibited in Canaan, and was actually to be encouraged elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Despite Euthymius' notorious stubbornness, which {{probably}} had discouraged Leo from raising {{him to the}} patriarchate sooner, he proved willing to grant the emperor economy, aided by the assent of the other patriarchates of the Pentarchy. Despite Zoe's repeated efforts, however, he steadfastly refused to officially recognize her marriage with the emperor as canonical and her status as empress. Leo was forced to do penance to atone for his marriage, and {{to pass a law}} excluding anyone from ever again marrying for a fourth time. As a result of the settlement, on 15 May 908 Euthymius crowned the infant Constantine VII as co-emperor. Even though the later Byzantine chroniclers tend to side with Nicholas Mystikos against Leo, they paint Euthymius in a favourable light. According to the Vita, his tenure helped heal the rift in the Church and reconcile many leading churchmen with the emperor's fourth marriage. Bishop Gabriel of Ancyra is <b>even</b> <b>said</b> to have sent the omophorion of Saint Clements as a gift and a token of appreciation.|$|E
