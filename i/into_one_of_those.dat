25|$|Duke Snider {{finished}} second to teammate Campanella in the MVP voting by just five points, 226–221, with each man receiving eight first place votes. The voting {{then as now}} was conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Each voting member, one from each major league city, filled out a ballot selecting ten men. A player receiving a first place vote got 14 points, 9 points for second, and then values of 8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 for those in places 3 through 10. A writer from Philadelphia who was sick and who had become hospitalized had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed in position number 1 as well as position number 5. The assumption had been that the writer had meant to write Snider's name <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> slots. Unable to get a clarification from the ill writer the BBWAA, after considering disallowing the ballot, decided to accept it, count the first place vote for Campanella and count the fifth place vote {{as though it were}} left blank. Had the ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider by three points. Had Snider gotten the fifth place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 227–226. Duke did, however, win the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955 and the Sid Mercer Award.|$|E
500|$|In general, the {{criteria}} for acceptance to the National Register are applied consistently, but there are considerations for exceptions to {{the criteria}} and historic districts have influence {{on some of those}} exceptions. Usually, the National Register does not list religious structures, moved structures, reconstructed structures, or properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years. However, if a property falls <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> categories and are [...] "integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria" [...] then an exception allowing their listing will be made. Historic district listings, like all National Register nominations, can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval. In the case of historic districts, a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. If such an objection occurred, then the nomination would become a determination of National Register eligibility only.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson went on {{to become}} a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson {{described}} him in Rolling Stone as a man who [...] "could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time" [...] and said [...] "his casket [...] have been launched <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it." [...] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While The Washington Post was lamenting Nixon's [...] "lonely and depressed" [...] state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that 'f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [...] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.' There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A good question, a {{very good}} question, Hoo-Hoo. But we did see--some of them. We had what we called microscopes and ultramicroscopes, and we put them to our eyes and looked through them, so that we saw things larger than they really were, and many things we could not see without the microscopes at all. Our best ultramicroscopes could make a germ look forty {{thousand}} times larger. A mussel-shell is a thousand fingers like Edwin's. Take forty mussel-shells, and by as many times larger was the germ when we looked at it through a microscope. And after that, we had other ways, by using what we called moving pictures, of making the forty-thousand-times germ many, many thousand times larger still. And thus we saw all these things which our eyes of themselves could not see. Take a grain of sand. Break it into ten pieces. Take one piece and break it <b>into</b> ten. Break <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> pieces <b>into</b> ten, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>into</b> ten, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>into</b> ten, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>into</b> ten, and do it all day, and maybe, by sunset, {{you will have a}} piece as small as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the germs."
