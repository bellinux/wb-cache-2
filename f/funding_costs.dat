50|$|Economist Randall S. Kroszner {{summarized}} several {{approaches to}} evaluating the <b>funding</b> <b>cost</b> differential between {{large and small}} banks.

30|$|Capital {{valuation}} adjustment (KVA) {{accounts for}} the cost of equity capital a bank incurs when entering a derivative trade. To explain the concept, some would say KVA is affine to FVA, in the sense that, in both cases, the cost is associated with a source of funding. The difference is that KVA, rather than measuring the <b>funding</b> <b>cost</b> coming from debt, refers to the <b>funding</b> <b>cost</b> from equity. That is, as a new deal is agreed on, it generates a cost of borrowing from the shareholder. That cost is normally of comparable scale to that of other valuation adjustments, which means its importance cannot be underestimated.|$|R

50|$|In banking {{terms the}} fact that a loan is made between {{business}} units may reflect agreed or contracted recognition of (too low in the financial crisis) costs rather than prevailing actual accurate <b>funding</b> <b>costs</b> and this is both an important audit concern and of taxation interest as transfer pricing affects where and in which business unit profit is reported.|$|E
50|$|Repricing risk {{reflects}} {{the possibility that}} assets and liabilities will be repriced at different times or amounts and affect an institution’s earnings, capital, or general financial condition in a negative way. For example, the management may use non-maturity deposits to fund long-term, fixed rate securities. If deposit rates increase, the higher <b>funding</b> <b>costs</b> would likely reduce net yields on fixed-rate securities.|$|E
50|$|FTP {{has become}} {{important}} because banks {{are expected to}} state their <b>funding</b> <b>costs</b> accurately as a regulatory requirement, because <b>funding</b> <b>costs</b> affect a bank's liquidity reporting. Failure and bail-outs of banks has made reported liquidity a hot topic. FTP calculation is complicated {{by a number of}} factors which make calculation of the revenue adjustment necessarily difficult. Factors affecting funding cost include the length of time an asset or liability is repaid (Liquidity Term Premium), the extent to which an asset has been or can be securitised (which affects its liquidity) and the *behaviour* of customers in particular product/customer niches such as customers' propensity to withdraw long-term deposits at a penalty or to repay obligations such as mortgages early, all which affect real funding cost. This behaviour factor complicates the calculation of FTP and has required significant and expensive changes to banking systems. Balance sheets now incorporate new attributes for customer and product which were not previously significant reporting dimensions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} interest rate setting behavior of the four largest banks in the Dutch mortgage market, using advertised interest rates at a daily frequency. The evidence {{for the long run}} pricing behaviour suggests that the banks operate in a competitive environment as they base their interest rates on <b>funding</b> <b>cost.</b> However, two banks appear to be less cost sensitive than the others. In the short run, most of the banks adjust their rates less strongly to <b>funding</b> <b>cost</b> increases than to decreases, which suggests competitive pressures. For one bank significant evidence is found for a quicker response to negative than to positive deviations of actual from desired interest rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of managed fund governance structures has become apparent in recent years. Looking at the Australian not-for-profit pension funds, we find correlations between funds&# 039; internal governance structures and {{their level of}} costs. Larger boards are linked to higher investment management fees and expenses, operating expenses and trustee and audit fees. We also find a positive relation between the proportion of independent trustees and investment management fees and expenses and operating expenses. These <b>fund</b> <b>costs</b> increase {{as the number of}} board committees and fund size increase. Finally, we observe that the presence of board committees affects different types of <b>fund</b> <b>costs.</b> Overall, these findings suggest that the conventional good governance practices do not benefit superannuation fund members in terms of cost reduction. We find no evidence of economies of scale in cost minimisation, since the relation between <b>fund</b> size and <b>costs</b> is mixed across various governance variables...|$|R

50|$|Funds {{transfer}} pricing (FTP) {{is a process}} used in banking to adjust the reported performance of different business units of a bank. A bank could have different kinds of business units. The split of these units between deposit-raising units and funds-advancing units affects whether they receive a positive or negative revenue adjustment. Both borrowing and lending contribute {{to the performance of}} the bank as a whole. FTP is a mechanism to adjust these profitabilities to incorporate true <b>funding</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
