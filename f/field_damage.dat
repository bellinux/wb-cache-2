5000|$|On 14 September 1999, at 21:47 UTC, a Boeing 757-204 {{charter flight}} from Cardiff, Wales, UK, with 236 {{passengers}} and 9 crew left the runway when landing {{in a storm}} and broke apart. After leaving the runway, it ran 343 metres across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi-airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit and severed a number of medium-sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then yawed considerably to the right, passed through the fence, landed again in a field, and its main landing gears collapsed. It finally stopped after a 244-metre slide across the <b>field.</b> <b>Damage</b> was substantial: the fuselage was broken in two places and the landing gear and both engines detached. Remarkably, there were no immediate fatalities but 44 people, including the aircraft's captain, received hospital treatment for severe to minor injuries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of the effect of damage during {{installation}} on the tensile properties of three different geosynthetics. The damage was induced on the geosynthetics using two different procedures: field trials and laboratory trials according to ENV ISO 10722 - 1. Soil and geosynthetic properties are described and the effect of damage during installation is studied. In what concerns the field trials two types of soils were used compacted with two different energies in order to conclude about the influence on damage during installation of the type of geosynthetic and of the type of soil, {{as well as of the}} compaction energy. Damage during installation laboratory tests were performed with three different aggregates, two of them natural and one synthetic. The results of the field trials and of the laboratory tests are compared in order to conclude about the liability of the laboratory tests in the prediction of <b>field</b> <b>damage</b> during installation. It was concluded that the geosynthetic structure, as well as the grain size and the sharpness of the confining soil and, also, the compaction energy have strong influence on <b>field</b> <b>damage</b> during installation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the intensity of}} oxidative molecular damage and its clinical correlations: visual <b>field</b> <b>damage,</b> intraocular pressure, age, and disease duration. METHODS: DNA was extracted from human trabecular meshwork specimens collected from 17 glaucoma-affected patients using standard filtration surgery. Twenty-one specimens from healthy eyes collected for cornea transplants serve as controls. Oxidative DNA damage was evaluated by determining 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine levels. All patients underwent a Humphrey 30 - 2 visual field examination and diurnal tonometry before surgery. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD DNA oxidative damage was 8. 51 +/- 5. 44 and 1. 75 +/- 1. 80 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine molecules/ 10 (5) normal nucleotides in patients with glaucoma and controls, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found among human trabecular meshwork DNA oxidative damage, visual <b>field</b> <b>damage,</b> and intraocular pressure. No other statistically significant correlations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress may represent an important pathogenetic step in primary open-angle glaucoma because it could induce human trabecular meshwork degeneration, favoring an intraocular pressure increase, thus priming the glaucoma pathogenetic cascade...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between endothelial dysfunction, endothelin 1 (ET- 1) plasma levels and subclinical inflammation in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Main methodsWe enrolled 40 POAG patients with progressive visual <b>field</b> <b>damage,</b> although well controlled intraocular pressure (IOP) and compared to age and sex matched healthxy subjects. Each patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, a standard achromatic perimetry (SAP), blood sampling to assess ET- 1 plasma levels, an objective assessment of cellularity within the anterior chamber (FLARE) and measurement of flow mediated dilation (FMD) with high resolution 2 -dimensional ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery. Key findingsAt baseline, POAG patients, compared to healthy controls, showed an increase of ET- 1 plasma levels: 2. 83 ± 0. 28 pg/ml vs. 1. 75 ± 0. 25 pg/ml (p 0. 001). SignificanceThe increase of ET- 1 in POAG patients is related to vascular dysfunction (r= 0. 942; p= 0. 001) and vascular dysfunction is related to sub-clinical intraocular inflammation (r= 0. 968; p= 0. 001).

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} several clinical variables {{on the development of}} visual field loss in the "second eye" of patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG) presenting with unilateral field loss.  METHODS—Patients with NTG and unilateral field loss at presentation were selected from a cohort of 403  consecutive diagnoses of NTG. The state of the visual field "normal" or with a visual field defect was defined using the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) template. Where available, optic disc planimetry was carried out on stereo photographs taken at presentation. Measurements of the topography of each of these optic discs were compared with morphometric values from a group of normal subjects, allowing for differences in age and disc size. For each patient the percentage of the relative neuroretinal rim (NRR) area was calculated. The time taken to develop a visual field defect was related to clinical factors including age, sex, peak and mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP), refraction, relative NRR area, and the AGIS score of the fellow eye at presentation RESULTS— 54 patients were included in the study. The median (range) follow up time was 49. 2  (11. 1 - 116. 7) months. 14  (26 %) patients developed field loss in the eyes with an initially normal field. The estimate of the median time to field loss onset was 95. 1  months. <b>Field</b> <b>damage</b> developed more rapidly in women and in patients with greater AGIS score in the contralateral eye at the beginning of follow up ((adjusted hazard ratio, HR (95 % confidence interval, CI) 0. 20  (0. 04; 0. 93); 1. 19  (1. 02; 1. 41) respectively)). Little evidence of any association was found between time to onset of field loss and each of age, refraction, and peak or mean diurnal IOP. Planimetric disc analysis was carried out in 33  (61 %) patients. Of these 10  (30 %) developed field loss in the eyes with initial normal field at a median follow up of 95. 1  months. After adjustment for sex and AGIS, relative NRR area was found to be significantly related to the time of onset of <b>field</b> <b>damage,</b> the greater the reduction in relative NRR area, the shorter the time to visual field loss (HR 0. 93  (0. 89; 0. 99)).  CONCLUSIONS—NTG patients with unilateral field loss are at high risk of developing <b>field</b> <b>damage</b> in the eyes with an initially normal visual field. In this study, the visual prognosis of the eye with the normal visual field at presentation was found to be influenced by the extent of the reduction in relative NRR area together with the severity of <b>field</b> <b>damage</b> in the contralateral eye at presentation. ...|$|E
