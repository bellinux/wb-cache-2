5|$|No queen consort of Menkauhor {{has been}} {{identified}} for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that Khuit I was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on the dating of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These arguments are criticized by the Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> queen.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.|$|E

5|$|About 82% of Americans live {{in urban}} areas (including suburbs); {{about half of those}} reside in cities with populations over 50,000. The US has {{numerous}} clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by {{more than a million people}} between 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Education {{remained}} mostly {{focused on}} the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained {{the province of the}} family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the trivium—grammar, rhetoric, logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Commercial secondary schools spread, and some Italian towns <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> such enterprise. Universities also spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500.|$|E

Two New York Islanders and Detroit Red Wings have also won the award. Players from the seven different Canadian teams have won this trophy on 12 of the 28 occasions that it has been awarded. Three members each from the Edmonton Oilers, and Calgary Flames, two members from the Vancouver Canucks, as well as one each from the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Winnipeg Jets have all won the award.|$|E

5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{appointment}} of the first Chamois Niortais manager, the Swiss coach Franchina, there have been 31 different first-team managers. Three of the coaches, Kazimir Hnatow, Robert Charrier and Pascal Gastien, have <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> spell {{in charge of the}} club. The current manager is Pascal Gastien, who was given the job in 2009 after Denis Troch was sacked following the side's relegation from the Championnat National. Gastien, a former Chamois Niortais player, is currently in his third spell as manager. To date, the only manager to have coached the club in the top division of French football is Patrick Parizon, during the 1987–88 season. The club's longest-serving manager was Ferdinand Faczinek, who had a five-year tenure between 1943 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{managers}} were appointed as caretaker managers {{prior to being}} given a permanent position; if so their caretaker appointment date is denoted in italics.

5|$|The {{bell tower}} has {{a ring of}} eight bells. The third bell was cast by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1697. The fourth was cast by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1716.

Taylor in 1840, presumably at their then Oxford foundry. In 1928 Taylors cast the treble, second and tenor bells, but at their Loughborough foundry St Mary's also has a small Sanctus bell cast by Peter de Weston of London in about 1336.|$|E
5|$|Losses on {{both sides}} were heavy. Arrogant had been damaged early in the battle and lost seven killed and 27 wounded while Victorious which bore {{the brunt of the}} French attack, {{suffered}} 17 killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Clark. Neither British ship was in sufficient repair to continue the engagement; Arrogant had several cannon dismounted and her sail's and rigging were tattered. Victorious was less badly damaged, but <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> in five of the crew unfit for duty. All of the French ships suffered damage and casualties, although Régénérée reported no losses in the aftermath. Vertu was damaged early on and took 24 casualties, Seine was hit by heavy fire later in the battle and lost 62 dead and wounded, with the captain among the former. The remainder of the squadron suffered lighter losses, with 12 on Prudente, 17 on Cybèle and 23 on Forte.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 40head coaches for the Cardinals {{franchise}} since {{it became a}} professional team in 1920; fourteen of the team's coaches are former Cardinals players. Ernie Nevers and Jimmy Conzelman are the only coaches to have <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> tenure with the team. Pop Ivy and Gene Stallings both coached the team during its move from one city to another. Cardinals coach Roy Andrews is tied for the lowest winning percentage among the team's coaches (.000), having lost the only game he coached, in 1931. Co-coach Walt Kiesling lost all 10 games he coached in 1943, when the team merged with the Steelers during World War II and was known as Card-Pitt. Co-coaches Ray Willsey, Ray Prochaska, and Chuck Drulis have the highest winning percentage among Cardinals coaches (1.000). The team's all-time leader in games coached is Ken Whisenhunt, who was hired on January 14, 2007, with 96. The all-time leader in wins is Whisenhunt with 45. Whisenhunt was fired on December 31, 2012, after the Cardinals recorded a 5–11 record in 2012.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} Oxford United Football Club managers from 1949, when the club turned professional, to the present day. During this time the club has had 23 full-time managers, of whom three (Jim Smith, Denis Smith and Darren Patterson) have <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> spell in the post, and nine periods of caretaker-management. The first manager appointed was Harry Thompson in July 1949. Thompson was in charge for nine years, during which he led the team to the Southern League title in 1953, as well as the Southern League Cup in 1953 and 1954. He was dismissed in November 1958 and replaced by Arthur Turner. Turner, the longest-serving manager in the club's history with more than a decade in charge, led United to back-to-back Southern League titles, of which the second, in 1962, resulted in their election to the Football League. Promotion followed from the Fourth Division in 1965, and the club were crowned Third Division champions three years later. Turner left the club nine months after this success. Over the next 13 years, five managers took charge: Ron Saunders, Gerry Summers, Mick Brown, Bill Asprey and Ian Greaves. During Brown's four-year run, United were relegated back to the Third Division after eight years in the Second.|$|E
