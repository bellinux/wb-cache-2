5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E

40|$|A new phage set was {{proposed}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> milk strains and its suitability was examined. Conclusions are summarized as follows : 1. Out of 77 phages isolated from lysogenic milk strains of staphylococci, 16 were selected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> milk strains and were named the "bovine phages". 2. These bovine phages were classified {{into two groups}} according to their host ranges; one was called group A and the other group B. The phages of group A were subdivided into types A_ 1 and A_ 2. 3. It was proved that the bovine phages were more suitable than <b>the</b> International phages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>typing</b> <b>of</b> staphylococcal strains isolated from bovine milk in Japan. 4. The relationship between the bovine phages and the International phages was shown. 5. The reacting ability of the bovine phages seemed {{to be limited to}} milk strains.

25|$|The obvious {{distinguishing}} features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects.

Neither were there models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.|$|E

In Blade Runner, they are used extensively by the LAPD to survey the general population, as well as by wealthy entrepreneurs. The Spinner was designed by Syd Mead. The Spinner has been replicated in films such as Back to the Future Part II, The Fifth Element and the Star Wars prequel trilogy.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top to butt, adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fishing a rod is built.
