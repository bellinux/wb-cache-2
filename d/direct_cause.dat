40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the application of}} social network analysis (SNA) in understanding and representing {{the relationships between the}} root and <b>direct</b> <b>causes</b> of defects. The root and <b>direct</b> <b>causes</b> of construction defects were identified through extensive literature review, and the thoroughness of the identified causes was confirmed by examining 91 non-conformance reports. The SNA software UCINET was used to visually map the links between the <b>direct</b> and root <b>causes</b> for identifying the root causes that accounted for the majority of <b>direct</b> <b>causes</b> and defects. A measure of centrality and adjacency indicated that the root cause Constructor Error/Omission was directly linked to seven of the ten identified <b>direct</b> <b>causes.</b> It was also determined that eliminating this root cause together with Transportation Error would reduce the number of defects by 90 %. Since the root causes responsible for the majority of <b>direct</b> <b>causes</b> as well as the largest number of defects could be identified using SNA, it is concluded that SNA is a valuable tool for recognizing where resources should be employed for the elimination of defects...|$|R

5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the <b>direct</b> <b>cause</b> of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E

5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a <b>direct</b> <b>cause</b> of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a <b>direct</b> <b>cause</b> or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors {{are more likely to have}} catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the <b>direct</b> <b>cause</b> of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{possible explanations}} of quantum correlations that satisfy {{the principle of}} continuity, which states that everything propagates gradually and continuously through space and time. In particular, following [J. D.

This is true even if the common and <b>direct</b> <b>causes</b> are allowed to propagate at a supraluminal-but-finite speed defined in a Newtonian-like privileged universal reference frame. Consequently, either there is supraluminal communication or the conclusion that Nature is nonlocal (i. e. discontinuous) is unavoidable.
