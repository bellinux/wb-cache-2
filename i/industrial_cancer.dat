40|$|In the Lancashire {{cotton textile}} industry, mule spinners were prone to a chronic and {{sometimes}} fatal skin cancer (often affecting the groin). The disease had reached epidemic proportions by the 1920 s, which necessitated {{action by the}} government, employers, and trade unions. In contrast to previous accounts, {{this article focuses on}} the government's reaction to mule spinners' cancer. Using official records in the National Archives, the slow introduction of health and safety measures by the government is explored in detail. Although obstructionism by the employers played a key role, {{one of the reasons for}} government inaction was the ambiguity of scientific research on engineering oils. On the other hand, prolonged scientific research suited a government policy that was framed around self regulation - a policy that had proved largely ineffective by the 1950 s. epithelioma, <b>industrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> occupational health, self-regulation,...|$|E

Case No. 1 : Six weeks prior to the first cystoscopic diagnosis, cytological examination was already positive. Case No. 2 : This was a follow-up case after TUR for bladder tumor. Cytological examination became positive but it was impossible to establish diagnosis by cystoscopy only. Biopsy revealed carcinoma in situ and infiltrating cancer. Case No. 3 : Cystoscopically the findings were those of cystitis, but cytological examination revealed neoplasm of high malignancy. Chromosome analysis of the exfoliated tumor cells obtained by pumping method was performed in a few cases.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{carcinogenesis}} is most advanced in bladder cancer through {{the study of}} what is called aniline bladder cancer. Bladder cancer has also {{played a key role in}} introducing the concept of 'occupational' <b>cancer.</b> <b>Industrial</b> Safety and Health Law defines various chemical substances as carcinogens of 'occupational' cancer, many of which are related to the urinary tract tumor, including benzidine, beta-naphthylamine, alpha-naphthylamine, 4 -aminodiphenyl, 4 -netrodiphenyl, auramine, magenta, orthotolidine, dianisidine, dichlorobenzidine and paradimethylaminoazobenzene. When a patient has been exposed to any of these substances, a diagnosis of 'occupational' cancer is made after consultation in the Central Labor Standards Council. Few bladder cancer patients are acknowledged as victims of 'occupational' cancer. In most cases the cause of bladder cancer remains unknown. However, cases of cancer caused by chemical substances are increasing, and many other chemical substances are probably carcinogenic.

40|$|High energy {{radiations}} are nowadays cornerstone in scientific, {{medical and}} <b>industrial</b> imaging and <b>cancer</b> therapy. However, their detection and dosimetry {{are restricted to}} systems of modest compactness that are not compatible with endoscopy. Here, we report the first experimental imaging and dosimetry of X-rays with an ultracompact sensor integrated {{at the end of}} a single mode optical fiber (125 μm full diameter). We realize such a dosimeter by coupling luminescent scintillators to a nano-optical antenna engineered at the end of the fiber and by detecting in-fiber outcoupled luminescence with a photon counter. Direct profile and real-time dosimetry of a X-ray focused beam reveals a spatial resolution of a few microns together with a sensitivity better than 10 ^ 3 X-photons/s/μm^ 2 at energies of 8 - 10 keV. Because the nano-optical platform is auto-aligned with respect to the fiber, the resulting dosimeter is plug-and-play, flexible, and it is suitable for ultralow footprint endoscopic investigations at higher X-ray energies. Our nano-optical approach thus offers the possibility of X-ray profiling and dosimetry in ultra-confined environments, opening up new avenues in the fields of X-ray imaging, real-time control of cancer radiotherapies and Curie therapies, medical and industrial endoscopy, etc. With this study, nano-optical antennas make a first key contribution to the development of X-ray sensing protocols and architectures...|$|R
40|$|Marathon runners spend {{considerable}} time outdoors training for {{and participating in}} marathons. Outdoor runners may experience high solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. South Africa, where running is popular, experiences high ambient solar UVR levels that {{may be associated with}} adverse health effects. This feasibility study explores the use of personal dosimeters to determine solar UVR exposure patterns and possible related acute health risks of four marathon runners during marathons and training sessions in Cape Town and Pretoria. Runners running marathons that started early in the day, and that did not exceed 4 hours, yielded low total solar UVR exposure doses (mean 0. 093 SED per exposure period run, median 0. 088 SED, range 0. 062 – 0. 136 SED; average of 16. 54 % of ambient solar UVR). Training sessions run during early morning and late afternoon presented similar results. Several challenges hindered analysis including accounting for anatomical position of personal dosimeter and natural shade. To assess health risks, hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated using a hypothetical runner’s schedule. Cumulative, annual solar UVR exposure-calculated acute health risks were low (HQ = 0. 024) for training sessions and moderate (HQ = 4. 922) for marathon runs. While these data and calculations are based on 18 person-days, one can measure marathon runners’ personal solar UVR exposure although several challenges must be overcome.

Evidence indicates that the hexavalent form is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Chemoprevention {{has emerged as a}} good strategy for reducing the risk from exposure to heavy metals. There is evidence that some tetrapyrrols such as protoporphyrin IX (PP-IX), a porphyrin without a metal center and which is a precursor of hemoglobin and cytochrome, acts as an antioxidant modulating the induction of antioxidant enzymes. The present study was performed to evaluate their antimutagenic potential of PP-IX against genetic damage induced by chromium trioxide (CrO 3). The wing spot test was used. Groups of 48 h-old larvae were pretreated for 24 h with 0, 0. 69, 6. 9, or 69 mM of PP-IX, after which groups of larvae were fed 0. 025 – 2. 5 mM CrO 3 solution in Drosophila instant medium. The results indicated that the lower PP-IX concentration (0. 69 mM) significantly reduced the genetic damage induced by all CrO 3 concentrations tested. In contrast, 6. 9 and 69 mM only inhibited the damage induced by CrO 3 2. 5 mM.

Along the way, we examine not only the level of pollution but also who is being polluted. As with so many other environmental hazards, it turns out that the problems are disproportionately borne by low-income communities of color. One unique aspect of this work is that we track the pollution not just to the smokestacks but to the companies that own them. Many firms are aware of their impacts on communities and the environment, and many have adopted strategies for becoming better corporate citizens.

40|$|This {{population-based}} case-referent {{study investigated}} the lung cancer risk associated with occupational exposure to asbestos, focusing on dose-response relations and the interaction with tobacco smoking. Incident cases of lung cancer among males aged 40 – 75 years in Stockholm County, Sweden, were identified from 1985 to 1990. Referents were selected randomly within strata (age, inclusion year) of the study base. Questionnaires administered to subjects or their next of kin gave information on occupations, tobacco smoking habits, and residences. Response rates of 87 % and 85 % resulted in 1, 038 cases and 2, 359 referents, respectively. Occupational exposures were assessed by an <b>industrial</b> hygienist. Lung <b>cancer</b> risk increased almost linearly with cumulative dose of asbestos. The risk at a cumulative dose of 4 fiber-years was 1. 90 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 32, 2. 74), higher than that predicted by downward linear extrapolation from highly exposed occupational cohorts. The relative risk (exp(beta)) for a transformed dose variable ln(fiber-years + 1) was 1. 494 (95 % CI: 1. 193, 1. 871) per unit of exposure.

40|$|Abstract Background Asturias, an Autonomous Region in Northern Spain {{with a large}} {{industrial}} area, registers high lung cancer incidence and mortality. While this excess risk of lung cancer might be partially attributable to smoking habit and occupational exposure, the role of industrial and urban pollution {{also needs to be}} assessed. The objective was to ascertain the possible effect of air pollution, both urban and <b>industrial,</b> on lung <b>cancer</b> risk in Asturias. Methods This was a hospital-based case-control study covering 626 lung cancer patients and 626 controls recruited in Asturias and matched by ethnicity, hospital, age, and sex. Distances from the respective participants' residential locations to industrial facilities and city centers were computed. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CIs) for categories of distance to urban and industrial pollution sources were calculated, with adjustment for sex, age, hospital area, tobacco consumption, family history of cancer, and occupation. Results Whereas individuals living near industries displayed an excess risk of lung cancer (OR = 1. 49; 95 %CI = 0. 93 - 2. 39), which attained statistical significance for small cell carcinomas (OR = 2. 23; 95 %CI = 1. 01 - 4. 92), residents in urban areas showed a statistically significant increased risk for adenocarcinoma (OR = 1. 92; 95 %CI = 1. 09 - 3. 38). In the Gijon health area, residents in the urban area registered a statistically significant increased risk of lung cancer (OR = 2. 17; 95 %CI = 1. 25 - 3. 76), whereas in the Aviles health area, no differences in risk were found by area of exposure.

40|$|Summary : Sapogenins are {{naturally}} occuring metabolites associated with several health benefits. The {{objective was to}} isolate the sapogenin mixture, pentahydroxy-pregn- 14 -ol, 20 -one -β-D-thevetopyranoside (PPG) from Wattakaka volubilis and  to assess their anti-inflammatory and apoptotic mechanism in human colon cancer cells in vitro. Sapogenins (WVSM) and pentahydroxy-pregn- 14 -ol, 20 -one -β-D-thevetopyranoside (PPG) are isolated from Wattakaka volubilis. The WVSM and PPG were subjected to cytotoxic assay (MTT), apoptotic parameters such as caspase- 3 assay and DNA fragmentation studies against HT- 29 cells. Macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7 were used to process anti-inflammatory studies includes COX- 2 and iNOS assay, NO and PGE 2 production. WVSM and PPG showed 62 and 52 % cytotoxicity against HT- 29 cells, caspase- 3 enzyme was increased and DNA fragmentation was showed in HT- 29 cells treated with WVSM and PPG. COX- 2 and iNOS activity was significantly decreased with the less production of PGE 2 and NO. From the present study it can be inferred that WVSM and PPG promotes cytotoxicity against HT- 29 cells with the activation of apoptotic mediators. It also promotes the anti-inflammatory activity via COX- 2 and iNOS inhibition. Hence the results support the traditional use of Wattakaka volubilis against various <b>cancers.</b> <b>Industrial</b> Relevance : Globally greater than 1  million people get colorectal cancer yearly resulting in about 0. 5  million deaths. As of 2008 {{it is the second}} most common cause of cancer in women and the third most common in men with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after  lung,  stomach, and liver cancer.  It is more common in developed than developing countries.
