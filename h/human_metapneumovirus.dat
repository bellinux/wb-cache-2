In this study, we investigated the abilities of two prototype strains of HMPV (A 1 [NL 0] and B 1 [NL 9]) to activate RIG-I and induce type I IFNs. Despite the abilities of both HMPV-A 1 and HMPV-B 1 to infect and replicate in cell lines and primary cells, only the HMPV-A 1 strain triggered RIG-I to induce IFNA/B gene transcription. The failure of the HMPV-B 1 strain to elicit type I IFN production was dependent on the B 1 phosphoprotein, which specifically prevented RIG-I-mediated sensing of HMPV viral 52 ̆ 7 triphosphate RNA. In contrast to most cell types, plasmacytoid dendritic cells displayed a unique ability to sense both HMPV-A 1 and HMPV-B 1 and in this case sensing was via TLR 7 rather than RIG-I.

40|$|The Innate {{immune system}} is {{the first line of}} defense against invading {{microbial}} pathogens. It is a fast-acting and non-antigen-specific defense system, which employs germline encoded surveillance systems capable of responding to a broad-spectrum of pathogens. The innate immune system involves a variety of immune cells, which express different profiles of surveillance or detection receptors. Upon sensing pathogens, these receptors trigger cell signalling to turn on transcription of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, anti-microbial peptides and type I Interferons. These effectors have direct effects on the control of pathogen load and also activate the adaptive immune system, which is ultimately required to clear infections. The type I interferons (IFNs) are the principal cytokines strongly induced during infection with viruses and are required for direct control of viral replication and modulation of cells of the adaptive immune response. The signalling pathways induced in order to activate type I IFNs are dependent on the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Striving for survival, microbes have evolved various strategies to subvert/impair these critical defense molecules. In this thesis work, I have used <b>Human</b> <b>Metapneumoviruses</b> (HMPVs), a relatively newly described family of paramyxoviruses as model viruses to explore the role of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the IRF family of transcription factors in the innate immune response. These studies revealed that the recognition of HMPV viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by immune cells is different in different cell types. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), a cytosolic RNA helicases senses HMPV-A 1 virus for triggering type I IFN activation by detecting its 5 ’- triphosphate viral RNA in most human cells, including cell lines and primary monocytes. An exception to these findings was plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), where Toll-like receptor (TLR) - 7 is the primary sensor involved in detecting HMPV viruses. By comparing the innate immune response to two HMPV strains, we found that these two closely related strains had very different immune stimulatory capabilities. HMPV- 1 A strain triggered type I IFNs in monocytes, PDCs and cells of epithelial origin. In contrast, a related strain, HMPV-B 1 failed to trigger IFN responses in most cell types. Our studies suggested that the phosphoprotein (P) of HMPV-B 1 could prevent the viral RNA from being detected by RIG-I, thus inhibiting the induction of type I IFN production in most cell type examined. This finding adds to our understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses are sensed by surveillance receptors and also unveils new means of viral evasion of host immune responses. Although IRFs are extensively studied for their role in regulating type I IFN activation, especially in TLR and RIG-I like receptor (RLR) signalling pathways upon viral infection, a clear understanding of how this family of transcription factors contributes to anti-viral immunity was lacking. Studies conducted as part of this thesis revealed that in addition to IRF 3 and IRF 7, which play a central role in anti-viral immunity downstream of most PRRs (e. g. TLRs, RLRs, DNA sensors), the related factor IRF 5 was also an important component of innate anti-viral defenses. Using IRF 5 -deficient mice we studied in detail the role of IRF 5 in coordinating antiviral defenses by examining its involvement in signalling downstream of TLRs. These studies led us to examine the role of IRF 5 in the regulation of type I IFNs as well as inflammatory cytokines in different cell types. While most TLRs that induced IFNβ showed normal responses in IRF 5 -deficient mice, CpG-B-induced IFNβ production in CD 11 c+CDCs isolated from mouse spleen but not those generated in vitro from bone marrow required IRF 5. This was in contrast to responses with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (polyIC), ligands for TLR 4 and 3, respectively. Moreover, we found that in contrast to IRF 3 and/or IRF 7, IRF 5 was important in coordinating the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα downstream of some TLRs. In addition to our studies to examine the requirement for IRF 5 in TLR signaling, we also showed that muramyl peptide (MDP) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) could activate type I IFNs via IRF 5. This was the first evidence linking IRF 5 to a non-TLR-driven pathway. IRF 5 activation in this case was downstream of a novel nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing (NOD) - 2 /receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (RIP) - 2 signaling pathway. Collectively, the studies outlined in this thesis have assisted in providing a framework to understand the role of TLRs, RLRs and IRFs in the immune response to paramyxoviruses and have unveiled new mechanisms of activation of the IRFs as well as new mechanisms by which pathogens subvert or evade these important innate defense mechanisms...|$|R

Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13 %, of which four (30. 7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. Conclusions the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co-detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria...|$|R
50|$|CAP {{in older}} infants {{reflects}} increased exposure to microorganisms, with common bacterial causes including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Maternally-derived syphilis {{is also a}} cause of CAP in this age group. Viruses include human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), <b>human</b> <b>metapneumovirus,</b> adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses, influenza and rhinovirus, and RSV is a common source of illness and hospitalization in infants. CAP caused by fungi or parasites is not usually seen in otherwise-healthy infants.|$|E

A vaccine for the papillomaviruses that cause cervical cancer was developed between 2002 and 2006. [...] In 2005, human T lymphotropic viruses 3 and 4 were discovered. In 2008 the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative was re-launched {{with a plan to}} eradicate poliomyelitis by 2015. In 2010, the largest virus, Megavirus chilensis was discovered to infect amoebae. These giant viruses have renewed interest in the role viruses play in evolution and their position in the tree of life.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{cases in the}} Western {{hemisphere}} were discovered in December, 2002 by clinical virologists at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut who were curious to discover if HCoV-HKU1 was in their area. They conducted a study of 851 infants and children over a 7-week period from December 2001 to February 2002. The children were also tested for Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (types 1-3), influenza A and B viruses, and adenovirus by direct immunofluorescence assay as well as <b>human</b> <b>metapneumovirus</b> and HCoV-NH by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All tested negative. Out of the 851 children, two tested positive for HCoV-HKU1. The researchers reported that the strain identified in New Haven {{is similar to the}} strain found in Hong Kong. This strain found in New Haven is sometimes referred to as HCoV-NH, for New Haven where it was discovered.|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{respiratory}} {{infections are}} {{the leading cause of}} mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Pneumonia accounts for 16 % of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935   000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. Methods: One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at − 70  °C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio‐Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded. Results: Of the samples tested, 81. 6 % were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23. 7 %, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16. 6 %, metapneumovirus in 5. 7 %, parainfluenza virus (types 1 – 4) in 5. 5 %, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3. 6 %, adenovirus in 2. 2 %, coronavirus (NL 63, OC 43, 229 E, and HKU 1) in 2. 2 %, and bocavirus in 0. 4 %. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22. 1 %; 18. 4 % of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), <b>human</b> enterovirus/rhinovirus, and <b>metapneumovirus</b> were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children...|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the route of HCoV-NL63 spread is through direct person-to-person transmission in highly populated areas. The virus can survive {{for up to a}} week in outside of the body in aqueous solutions at room temperature and three hours on dry surfaces. Most people will be infected with a coronavirus in their lifetime, but some populations are more susceptible to HCoV-NL63. These population include {{children under the age of}} 5, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The virus seems to have seasonal incidence, occurring most frequently in the winter months in temperate climates. In more extreme and tropical climates the virus has no preference toward a particular season. Many studies have reported the co-occurrence of HCoV-NL63 with other human coronavirus, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and <b>human</b> <b>metapneumovirus</b> (hMPV). The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoV-NL63 including: washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and not touching the eyes, mouth, or nose.|$|E
