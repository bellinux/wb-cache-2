25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is <b>de-energized,</b> the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears <b>de-energized</b> (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Stepper motors are a type {{of motor}} {{frequently}} used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled {{by a set of}} external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also {{be thought of as a}} cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it [...] "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and <b>de-energized</b> in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} growing {{recognition}} {{about the role of}} informal networks in organizations and the importance of energizers in the workplace, chances are that managers and organizations are missing a potentially devastating expense: de-energizers. Over the past decade we've studied the effects of negative or <b>de-energizing</b> ties, defined as enduring, recurring set of negative judgments, feelings, and behavioral intentions towards another person. While <b>de-energizing</b> ties may represent a relatively small proportion of ties, they have a disproportionately potent effect on individuals, other employees, and teams within organizations. At the individual level <b>de-energizing</b> relationships can result in blocked opportunities, decreased motivation, and even organizational isolation. The consequences include decreased levels of thriving, lower performance, and increased likelihood of exit. The effects on others are very similar. Countless co-workers often get sucked into these negative situations. At the team level <b>de-energizing</b> ties can cause more conflict, lower team cohesion and trust, and decrease boundary spanning activity. The result is less access to critical information, a decrease in the ability to solve problems, and overall lower team performance. <b>De-energizing</b> ties are not insurmountable, though. Managerial actions, such as conflict resolution, training and mentoring, as well as staffing changes, can change the dynamics of informal organizational networks and minimize the effects of <b>de-energizing</b> ties. Likewise, individual actions such as better awareness and strategic management of one's own network can decrease the effects of <b>de-energizing</b> relationships.

2500|$|Conrail made initial {{plans to}} sell the bridge to bridge enthusiast and lawyer Donald L. Pevsner, by an option granted to him on February 1, 1984. Later in 1984, Conrail advised Pevsner to take title of the bridge in a shell corporation, with no assets but the bridge and no funds to pay for {{necessary}} insurance and maintenance; the railroad {{just wanted to be}} rid of the bridge, whatever the dubious ethics of such disposal. This decision was made personally by then-Conrail Chairman L. Stanley Crane, at a time when Conrail was owned by the U.S. Government. Pevsner refused, and let his option expire on November 1, 1984. [...] One day later, on November 2, 1984, Conrail sold the bridge for $1 to a convicted bank swindler (SEE Poughkeepsie JOURNAL: various issues) and ex-felon named Gordon Schreiber Miller, of St. Davids, Pennsylvania, to [...] "get it off the books.". For the next fourteen years, Miller and his successor, Vito Moreno, spent little or nothing on maintenance or insurance, while attempting to drastically increase the $25,000 annual rent paid by Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation for its three 115,000-volt and three 69,000-volt power lines across the Hudson, attached to {{the south side of the}} bridge since 1949. In response, Central Hudson <b>de-energized</b> those power lines and relocated them under the river in 1985, thereby ending Miller's only source of bridge income. During this long period, critical bridge navigation lights were mostly inoperative, resulting in large U.S. Coast Guard fines against the Miller corporation that all went unpaid. Further, all of the 2,200-pound brackets that connected Central Hudson's <b>de-energized</b> high-tension power lines to the south side of the bridge continued to deteriorate by rusting. Though Central Hudson admitted that it normally had a legal duty to remove its abandoned power lines, it refused to remove its abandoned bridge-affixed lines, instead relying on a claim that it no longer owned the lines at issue pursuant to prior litigation with Conrail that was decided on September 26, 1984, and won a similar legal opinion before the New York State Public Service Commission in 1995, which was left to stand on April 1, 1999 when The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge Company, Inc., as the successor owner to Gordon Schreiber Miller and Vito Moreno, withdrew its 1998 complaint against Central Hudson on January 27, 1999.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{protecting}} personnel from arc flash hazards.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be <b>de-energized</b> before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is <b>de-energized.</b> Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be <b>de-energized,</b> insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|E

The victim’s daily tasks included cleaning out the concrete mixer {{at the end}} of the shift. The clean-out procedure was to shut off the power at the breaker panel (approximately 35 feet from the mixer), push the toggle switch by the mixer to make sure that the power was off, and then enter the mixer to clean it. No one witnessed the event, but investigators concluded that the mixer operator had shut off the main breaker and then made a telephone call instead of following the normal procedure for checking the mixer before any one entered it. The victim did not know that the operator had <b>de-energized</b> the mixer at the breaker. Thinking he was turning the mixer off, he activated the breaker switch and energized the mixer. The victim then entered the mixer and began cleaning without first pushing the toggle switch to make sure that the equipment was <b>de-energized.</b> The mixer operator returned from making his telephone call and pushed the toggle switch to check that the mixer was <b>de-energized.</b> The mixer started, and the operator heard the victim scream.
