50|$|<b>Hetacillin</b> can be {{administered}} orally. The potassium salt, <b>hetacillin</b> potassium, {{is administered by}} injection, either intravenously or intramuscularly. It is sold under the trade name Hetacin for intramammary injection in veterinary use.|$|E
50|$|As {{opposed to}} ampicillin, <b>hetacillin</b> is only {{marginally}} {{broken down by}} the bacterial enzyme beta-lactamase, at least in vitro.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-imidazolidinones are cyclic amides. Several {{have been}} {{investigated}} as organocatalysts. [...] Drugs featuring this ring include <b>hetacillin,</b> NNC 63-0532, spiperone, and spiroxatrine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hetacillin</b> {{was removed}} from the market for human use when the {{discovery}} was made that it is actually cleaved in the gastrointestinal tract to formaldehyde and had no advantages over ampicillin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hetacillin</b> is {{prepared}} from ampicillin and acetone. In aqueous solutions it is unstable, {{with a half}} life of 15 to 30 minutes at [...] and pH 7, quickly releasing acetone again.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hetacillin</b> is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic {{that is part}} of the aminopenicillin family. It is a prodrug and it has no {{antibacterial activity}} itself, but quickly splits of acetone in the human body to form ampicillin, which is active against a variety of bacteria.|$|E
40|$|Fast {{methods for}} {{measuring}} inhibition {{of growth of}} Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus by <b>hetacillin</b> or ampicillin showed {{that the rate of}} inhibition was a function of the antibiotic concentration. When ampicillin concentrations were measured rapidly, <b>hetacillin</b> was shown to have a half-life of 20 min at 37 C and pH 6. 7. <b>Hetacillin</b> was much less susceptible to penicillinase (β-lactamase) than was ampicillin. An inhibitory effect of <b>hetacillin</b> was shown in the presence of β-lactamase, which destroyed ampicillin activity very rapidly...|$|E
40|$|Urological {{operations}} are often performed for diseases associated with urinary infection or are frequently followed by postoperative infection. This {{is the reason}} we need a potent antibiotic just like <b>hetacillin,</b> a newly synthesized broad spectrum penicillin. The clinical evaluation of <b>hetacillin</b> (commercially Natacillin) was made on the postoperative infection or on the cases with indwelling catheter. Postoperative infusion of the massive dosis of <b>hetacillin</b> resulted in improvement of infection recognized preoperatively and prevention of new infection due to indwelling catheter. Various function tests proved on harmful effect on any vital organ. From the above results, {{it was concluded that}} the large dosis intravenous administration of <b>hetacillin</b> in the early postoperative period is quite valuable...|$|E
40|$|There is the {{tendency}} of increase of urinary tract infection with resistant gram-negative bacilli. Aminobenzyl-PC and <b>hetacillin</b> (Versapen) were administrated to five cases with various urinary tract infections of resistant strains. The effective results were obtained in three cases but the alterations or superinfections were observed in two cases. The main strains of chronic urinary tract infection in Nagoya University Hospital were Klebsiella and E. coli that were highly resistant against the classical broad spectrum antibiotics. Ten cases of urinary infections with resistant gram negative bacilli were treated by AB-PC or <b>hetacillin</b> (Versapen) and MCI-PC. The synergistic action of AB-PC or <b>hetacillin</b> and MCI-PC was found in seven cases of Klebsiella, Rettgerella and Ps. aeruginosa infections. No significant side effect was observed in this series...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} 2 intramammary treatments for mild-to-moderate cases of clinical mastitis in a noninferiority comparison. Noninferiority trials are intended to show whether a given treatment, <b>hetacillin</b> potassium, has at least comparable efficacy as the reference treatment, ceftiofur hydrochloride. Treatments can be deemed inferior to the reference treatment by an amount less than the margin of noninferiority, or inconclusive if the confidence interval crosses the margin of noninferiority. Cows with clinical mastitis from 6 farms were considered for enrollment. Using a randomized design, cows with mild or moderate mastitis in 1 quarter were assigned to on-label treatment with either ceftiofur or <b>hetacillin.</b> A total of 596 cows met the criteria needed for continued enrollment. Treatment distribution resulted in 309 cows in the ceftiofur group and 287 cows in the <b>hetacillin</b> group. Mixed regression analysis was performed for the following outcomes: bacteriological cure, pathogen cure, clinical cure, postevent milk production and linear score, and survival to d 30 and 60. Cox proportional hazards {{analysis was used to}} describe treatment effect on survival and mastitis risks. Bacteriological cure, defined as absence of causative organism in samples retrieved at d 14 and 21 postmastitis, was similar between groups. No significant statistical differences were found in cure risk, and noninferiority of <b>hetacillin</b> relative to ceftiofur for bacteriological cure was conclusive (hetacillin= 67 %, ceftiofur= 72 %). Absence of a pathogen on both follow-up samples designated a cow as a pathogen cure. Pathogen cure was similar between treatment groups and noninferiority of <b>hetacillin</b> relative to ceftiofur was shown (hetacillin= 35 %, ceftiofur= 32 %). Clinical cure (hetacillin= 68 %, ceftiofur= 64 %), postevent milk production (hetacillin= 37. 0 kg, ceftiofur= 38. 2 kg), and linear scores (hetacillin= 3. 4, ceftiofur= 3. 1) were also not statistically different between treatment groups. Noninferiority of <b>hetacillin</b> relative to ceftiofur was shown for survival to d 30 and survival to d 60, whereas <b>hetacillin</b> was {{more likely to have a}} clinical cure than ceftiofur by d 4. No differences were seen between groups when Cox proportional hazards were performed, neither for exit from the herd in the 60 d following the event nor in the risk for a subsequent mastitis event. These findings can be used to develop farm-specific protocols for clinical mastitis treatment...|$|E
40|$|Foram tratados 155 pacientes do sexo masculino, portadores de uretrite gonocócica aguda, com 3, 0 g de Hetacilina K por via oral (70 casos) ou 1, 0 g do mesmo medicamento por via {{intramuscular}} (85 casos). Em 88, 6 % dos casos tratados pela via oral, e em 93 % dos casos tratados com uma injeção intramuscular, o corrimento desapareceu em um tempo médio de 48 horas.
