25|$|KCNE2 was {{originally}} discovered to regulate hERG channel function. KCNE2 decreases marcoscopic and unitary current through hERG, and speeds hERG deactivation. hERG generates IKr, {{the most prominent}} repolarizing current in human ventricular cardiomyocytes. hERG, and IKr, are highly susceptible to block by a range of structurally diverse pharmacological agents. This property means that many drugs or potential drugs {{have the capacity to}} impair human ventricular repolarization, leading to drug-induced Long QT syndrome (LQTS). KCNE2 may also regulate hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) pacemaker channels in human heart and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> other species, as well as the Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel.|$|E

She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.|$|E
25|$|The synod {{teaches that}} the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace {{through which the}} Holy Spirit gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> individuals, forgives sins {{for the sake of}} Christ's death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that {{combines}} a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did {{not wait}} on the Revolution in France. The {{individuals}} in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by the}} revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{travel to}} Ti'atha Forest where they {{encounter}} {{the spirit of}} Kisala's father, King Albioth (Fred Tatasciore). Albioth had faced Mother, but lost and {{had turned into a}} beast. He tells them the only way she can be defeated is by neutralizing the power of her Rune, using Drigellum energy; which can only be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> good people. Each of the party's hearts generates Drigellum, which is forged into a sword. The party enter Mother's lair and fight her. Jaster again releases the power of the Star King. He reveals Mother as being a sorceress named Ilzarbella (Wendee Lee) who served the Star King until she was seduced by the power of Rune. Using the Drigellum sword, the Star King/Jaster kills her. However, as soon as the battle ends, the Emperor arrives with the intention of collecting the Rune energy to create beasts so as to continue the war. However, Rune takes over the ship, killing Valkog and Norma, and integrating them into an organic vessel which it uses to attack Jaster and his group. The group split up, with each member attacking a separate part of the ship, eventually defeating it.|$|E
25|$|Frik du Preez is {{probably}} the greatest Northerns hero of all heroes. The Springbok lock and flank {{was not only a}} dazzling player on the field, but was equally popular off the field. Together with his close friend, Mof Myburgh, both played a total of 109 matches for the Northern Transvaal. Du Preez and Myburgh were inseparable, and Myburgh also proved to be a hero of note. Despite being rather short for a lock, Du Preez's line-out work was practically unequalled and his powerful sprints struck fear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> his opposition, while he also kicked for posts for the Springboks and Northern Transvaal and put away some magnificent drop goals. How popular he was, even outside Pretoria, is apparent from {{the fact that he was}} carried, shoulder high, off the field after his last game at Newlands in Cape Town in a match that Northerns won by 25-14. Frik retired at the end of the 1971 season. Du Preez was nominated by the magazine SA Rugby as the South African player of the century, and was the first South African to be honoured, along with Dr Danie Craven, in the International Hall of Fame in Auckland, New Zealand.|$|E
