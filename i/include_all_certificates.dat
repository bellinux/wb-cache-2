40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we have tried}} to present a {{descriptive}} description of Cryptographic Hardware. Cryptography itself is a math that provides the security in many technologies, <b>including</b> <b>all</b> digital <b>certificate</b> and encryption systems. Either Software or Hardware implementations of cryptography can be used. The Hardware implementation is secure, faster, but comes at an exorbitant price. To this extent the current trends in Hardware implementations have a promising future for cost effective hardware crypto-systemss. In this regard we try to give a summary of Cryptography Processor Architecture, Dynamic implementation of one of the AES standards. For this, we have chosen the Serpernt Block Cipher algorithm. And finally the comparision of the performance of FPGA implementation of five standard AES algorithms and determine their suitability for FPGA implementation...|$|R
50|$|CyberTrust {{was founded}} as a {{subsidiary}} of GTE Corporation's Government Systems Information Security Directorate. It focused on security services for electronic commerce. These included authentication, privacy, integrity and non-repudiation using Public Key Encryption technology. In 2000, GTE sold CyberTrust to Ireland-based security company Baltimore Technologies for $150 million. In 2003, Baltimore Technologies divested its operating companies, <b>including</b> <b>all</b> digital <b>certificate</b> operations to BeTrusted Holdings, Inc. A year later in September 2004, BeTrusted announced its intention to merge with former competitor TruSecure Corporation and in November the resulting company was incorporated in Virginia as CyberTrust. Verizon Business then acquired Cybertrust in 2007, reuniting it with its former parent (Verizon {{was created by the}} merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic). Financial terms were not disclosed. In 2015, the CyberTrust root certificates were acquired by DigiCert, Inc., a leading global Certificate Authority (CA) and provider of trusted identity and authentication services. The financial terms were not disclosed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{analysed}} nationwide {{trends and}} {{spatial distribution of}} NTD-related mortality in Brazil. We <b>included</b> <b>all</b> death <b>certificates</b> in Brazil from 2000 to 2011, in which NTDs were recorded as any causes of death. A total of 100, 814 / 12, 491, 280 (0. 81 %) death certificates were identified, which mentioned at least one NTD. Age-adjusted NTD-related mortality rates showed a significant decrease over time (annual percent change [APC]: − 2. 1 %; 95 % CI: − 2. 8 to − 1. 3), with decreasing mortality rates in the Southeast, South, and Central-West regions, stability in the Northeast region, and increase in the North region. We identified spatial and spatiotemporal high-risk clusters for NTD-related mortality in all regions, with a major cluster covering a wide geographic range in central Brazil. Despite nationwide decrease of NTD-related mortality in the observation period, regional differences remain, with increasing mortality trends especially in the socioeconomically disadvantaged regions of the country. The existence of clearly defined high-risk areas for NTD-related deaths reinforces the need for integrated prevention and control measures in areas with highest disease burden...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the most {{frequent}} non-conformities identified in different European countries in the processes of forest management certification according to FSC standards. A total of 31 active certificates from five countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Romania, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) were analysed, <b>including</b> <b>all</b> active <b>certificates</b> (as of 1 st of June 2014) from three countries along with a sample of 13 FSC certificates issued in the UK and one certificate covering 95 % of the certified forest area in Slovenia. 253 non-conformities in relation to FSC standard requirements were identified as formulated by the audit teams and the most frequently identified non-conformities in the certification process were those related to Principle 6 - Environmental impact (34 %), Principle 4 - Community relations and workerâ€™s rights (17 %) and Principle 8 - Monitoring and Assessment (13 %). A slight positive correlation was noticed between the FSC certified area and the total number of non-conformities, with a closer link in the case of Principle 9 - Maintenance of high conservation value forests, and Principle 4. The non-conformities related to Principles 4, 6 and 9 appeared to be significantly influenced in occurrence by country development; less often in the UK compared with the other four countries...|$|R
40|$|Injuries {{comprise}} the main group of causes of mortality among women 15 to 35 {{years of age}} in Brazil. The present study aimed to improve the knowledge concerning mortality by injuries, using a descriptive population-based approach, <b>including</b> <b>all</b> 869 death <b>certificates</b> for resident 10 - 49 -year-old women from Cascavel, Paraná State, who died between 1991 and 2000.

Injuries were the main group of causes of death up to 34 {{years of age and}} for all women 15 - 45 (coefficient 29. 4 / 100, 000 women) and the third most common among women 35 - 45.

Ever increasingly, the so-called “portfolios” are becoming accepted as the basic documents on any individual's knowledge, experience and personal abilities, In this article, the au­ thor takes a stance for the formal recognition and affirmation of experiential learning, i. e. studies which are conducted concurrently with work. In order to establish the experiential knowledge gained, one must first of all have a clear concept of the relevant aims and standards. Assessment of the standards of learning should be primarily directed towards the include study-objective, but should also include examples of the work-products, {{as well as an}} analytical review by several assessors.
