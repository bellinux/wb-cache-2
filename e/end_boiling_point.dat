50|$|An {{interesting}} {{property of}} heat pipes is the temperature range over {{which they are}} effective. Initially, it might be suspected that a water-charged heat pipe only works when the hot <b>end</b> reaches the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (100 °C, 212 °F, at normal atmospheric pressure) and steam is transferred to the cold <b>end.</b> However, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of water depends on the absolute pressure inside the pipe. In an evacuated pipe, water vaporizes from its triple point (0.01 °C, 32 °F) to its critical point (374 °C; 705 °F), {{as long as the}} heat pipe contains both liquid and vapor. Thus a heat pipe can operate at hot-end temperatures as low as just slightly warmer than the melting point of the working fluid, although the maximum rate of heat transfer is low at temperatures below 25 °C (77 °F). Similarly, a heat pipe with water as a working fluid can work well above the atmospheric <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (100 °C, 212 °F). The maximum temperature for long term water heat pipes is 270 °C (518 °F), with heat pipes operating up to 300 °C (572 °F) for short term tests.|$|R
50|$|Ethylene {{and oxygen}} are passed co-currently in a {{reaction}} tower at about 130 °C and 400 kPa. The catalyst is an aqueous solution of PdCl2 and CuCl2. The acetaldehyde is purified by extractive distillation followed by fractional distillation. Extractive distillation with water removes the lights <b>ends</b> having lower <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> than acetaldehyde (chloromethane, chloroethane, and carbon dioxide) at the top, while water and higher-boiling byproducts, such as acetic acid, crotonaldehyde or chlorinated acetaldehydes, are withdrawn together with acetaldehyde at the bottom.Due to the corrosive nature of catalyst, the reactor {{is lined with}} acid-proof ceramic material and the tubing is made of titanium.|$|R
25|$|Polymerization {{results from}} the {{addition}} of a second olefin to the C8 carbocation formed in the primary reaction. The resulting C12 carbocation can continue to react with an olefin to form a larger carbocation. As with the previously described mechanisms, the heavy carbocations may at some point undergo a hydride transfer from isobutane to yield a C12 – C16 isoparaffin and a t-butyl cation. These heavy molecules tend to lower the octane and raise the <b>boiling</b> <b>end</b> <b>point</b> of the alkylate effluent.|$|R
25|$|Each {{azeotrope}} has {{a characteristic}} <b>boiling</b> <b>point.</b> The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of an azeotrope is either {{less than the}} <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> temperatures of any of its constituents (a positive azeotrope), or greater than the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of any of its constituents (a negative azeotrope).|$|R
25|$|The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> {{corresponds}} to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> {{is dependent on the}} pressure. <b>Boiling</b> <b>points</b> may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325 kPa (or 1 atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> is also lower. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> cannot be increased beyond the critical <b>point.</b> Likewise, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> decreases with decreasing pressure until the triple point is reached. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> cannot be reduced below the triple point.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a cryogenic Joule-Thomson refrigeration capable of pumping multicomponent gases {{with a single}} stage sorption compressor system. Alternative methods of pumping a multicomponent gas with a single stage compressor are disclosed. In a first embodiment, the sorbent geometry is such that a void is defined near {{the output of the}} sorption compressor. When the sorbent is cooled, the sorbent primarily adsorbs the higher <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas such that the lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas passes through the sorbent to occupy the void. When the sorbent is heated, the higher <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas is desorbed at high temperature and pressure and thereafter propels the lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas out of the sorption compressor. A mixing chamber is provided to remix the constituent gases prior to expansion of the gas through a Joule-Thomson valve. Other methods of pumping a multicomponent gas are disclosed. For example, where the sorbent is porous and the low <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas does not adsorb very well, the pores of the sorbent will act as a void space for the lower <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas. Alternatively, a mixed sorbent may be used where a first sorbent component physically adsorbs the high <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas and where the second sorbent component chemically absorbs the low <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> gas...|$|R

50|$|For {{economic}} reasons evaporators are seldom operated on low-TDS water sources. Those applications are filled by reverse osmosis.

Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels.
