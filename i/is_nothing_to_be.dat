25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E

Ilana tells Michael there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned from the camps and refuses the money. Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one. She wants him {{to take care of}} this instead. Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account.|$|E

Shay was suspended indefinitely in late June 1911 after a fight with an umpire. In October 1911, Shay abruptly resigned as the manager in Kansas City. He declined to say what prompted his resignation {{and said that he}} might not be permanently finished with baseball, but {{he said that he was}} finished with the Kansas City club. When asked about the possibility of a major league managing job, Shay responded, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said now, but there may be something later." ...|$|E

500|$|Professor David Harman {{observed}} that Swaminarayan [...] "criticized the popular shakta cults and 'gosai' and 'nath' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental {{way in which}} they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women." [...] Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to protect the ill treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan [...] "forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex." [...] This strict precept was one he likely internalized [...] "after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [...] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught “the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attractive.|$|E
500|$|During 1931, NSS {{was busy}} closing shipyards {{elsewhere}} in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. [...] By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: [...] "Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what {{is one of the}} finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" [...] Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: [...] "The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds... was the ring of the breakers' hammers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E

2500|$|Asquith {{had opposed}} votes for women {{as early as}} 1882, and he {{remained}} well known as an adversary throughout his time as prime minister. He took a detached view of the women's suffrage question, believing it should be judged on whether extending the franchise would improve the system of government, {{rather than as a}} question of rights. He did not understand—Jenkins ascribed it to a failure of imagination—why passions were raised on both sides over the issue. He told the House of Commons in 1913, while complaining of the [...] "exaggerated language" [...] on both sides, [...] "I am sometimes tempted to think, as one listens to the arguments of supporters of women's suffrage, that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said for it, and I am sometimes tempted to think, as I listen to the arguments of the opponents of women's suffrage, that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said against it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hume {{attended}} the University of Edinburgh at the unusually early age of twelve (possibly {{as young as}} ten) {{at a time when}} fourteen was normal. At first, because of his family, he considered a career in law, but came to have, in his words, [...] "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [...] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring". He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books". Hume did not graduate.|$|E

In the same letter he wrote of his aim to [...] "improve {{the taste of the}} discerning public upon ecclesiastical architecture." [...] In July of the same year, he began this by giving his first lecture, on Norman architecture, presumably at the Sydney School of Arts. Towards the end of the year, he and Sarah rented a house from Dr Hammett in Stanley Street, off College Street, where he was soon to receive an important architectural commission. Their first child, Edith, was born at Stanley Street the following year.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1906, Hammond {{was hired}} as the {{head coach of the}} Ole Miss Rebels {{football}} team. [...] He began practice with the team on September 15, 1906, and Atlanta's The Constitution reported at the time that [...] "the squad of candidates" [...] that turned out for Hammond's team was [...] "decidedly small," [...] and [...] "the new material in sight right now <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of." [...] Accordingly, the Atlanta paper noted that [...] "those who have entertained enthusiastic hopes for a successful eleven this season are somewhat disappointed to date." [...] Hammond spent the first two weeks with the team [...] "drilling them daily in the elementary part of the game and impressing on them the importance of the new rules," [...] which included legalization of the forward pass. [...] Hammond led the Ole Miss team to a 4–2 record in 1906, including wins over LSU (9–0), Tulane (17–0) and Mississippi State (29–5). [...] One of the team's two losses came against Vanderbilt, coached by Hammond's former University of Michigan teammate, Dan McGugin.|$|E
2500|$|Gabe Habash of Publishers Weekly {{called it}} an ingenious, upsetting, and unforgettable novel. He added, [...] "There is much to admire in Han's novel. Its three-part {{structure}} is brilliant, gradually digging {{deeper and deeper into}} darker and darker places; the writing is spare and haunting; but perhaps most memorable is its crushing climax, a phantasmagoric yet emotionally true moment that's surely one of the year's most powerful". He compared its parts to Patrick Süskind's Perfume, Herman Koch's The Dinner, and Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life respectively. Eileen Battersby, writing for The Irish Times, said, [...] "The Vegetarian is more than a cautionary tale about the brutal treatment of women: it is a meditation on suffering and grief. It is about escape and how a dreamer takes flight. Most of all, it is about the emptiness and rage of discovering there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done when all hope and comfort fails. For all the graphic, often choreographed description, Han Kang has mastered eloquent restraint in a work of savage beauty and unnerving physicality." [...] Laura Miller, writing for Slate, compares the straightforward style of writing with works by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami.|$|E

Franz Brentano established a branch of his business in Vienna and joined his wife there. Bettina von Arnim, in her epistolary novel Goethe's Correspondence with a Child describes Birkenstock's collection as follows: [...] "I am much pleased with the old tower, from whence I overlook the whole Prater: trees on trees of majestic appearance, delightful green lawns. [...] Here I live in the house of the deceased Birkenstock, in the midst of two thousand engravings, as many drawings, as many hundred antique urns, and Etrurian lamps, marble vases, antique remains of hands and feet, pictures, Chinese dresses, coins, collections of minerals, sea-insects, telescopes, countless maps, plans of ancient buried kingdoms and cities, skilfully carved sticks, valuable documents, and lastly the sword of the Emperor Carolus. [...] All these surround us in gay confusion, and are just about being brought into order, so there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> touched or understood, and with the chesnut-alley in full blossom, and the rushing Danube, which bears us over on his back, there is no enduring the Gallery of Art." ...|$|E
