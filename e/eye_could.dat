5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from the <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> instantaneously light up the stars every time someone blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E

500|$|Betelgeuse, also {{designated}} Alpha Orionis (α Orionis, abbreviated Alpha Ori, α Ori), is the ninth-brightest star in {{the night}} sky and second-brightest in the constellation of Orion.

500|$|His {{answer was}} {{that in many cases}} animals exist with {{intermediate}} structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> have evolved. Darwin concludes: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.

[...] Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot.

500|$|The {{plastic surgery}} used to {{reconstruct}} Smith's face following his crash in the Western Desert in 1943 left his face somewhat lopsided, with partial paralysis. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn {{writes that the}} grafted skin on his face [...] "almost hides the injuries even today, though it has {{left him with a}} slightly blank expression". This was often commented on by observers, and when Smith died in 2007, it was prominent in many of his obituaries. [...] "It was Ian Smith's war-damaged left eye that drew people's attention first," [...] began the report printed in the London Times: [...] "wide open, heavy-lidded and impassive from experimental plastic surgery, it hinted at a dull, characterless nature. The other was narrow, slanting and slightly hooded. Being watched by it was an uncomfortable experience. Each <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> have belonged to a different person." [...] The Daily Telegraph took a similar line, reporting that the operation to reconstruct Smith's face had [...] "left him with a somewhat menacing stare".|$|E
500|$|Virginia was {{described}} as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called [...] "pure white", causing a [...] "bad complexion that spoiled her looks". One visitor to the Poe family noted that [...] "the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright", possibly a symptom of her illness. Another visitor in Fordham wrote, [...] "Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look." [...] That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human. William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of [...] "matchless beauty and loveliness, her <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> match that of any houri, and her face defy the genius of a Canova to imitate". She {{might have been a}} little plump. Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even {{in the last years of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|Magic mirrors: In about 800 AD, {{during the}} Tang Dynasty (618–907), a book {{entitled}} Record of Ancient Mirrors described {{the method of}} crafting solid bronze mirrors with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly transparent effect, they were called 'light-penetration mirrors' by the Chinese. Unfortunately, this Tang era book was lost over the centuries, but magic mirrors were described in the Dream Pool Essays by the Song dynasty polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095), who owned three {{of them as a}} family heirloom. Perplexed as to how solid metal could be transparent, Shen guessed that some sort of quenching technique was used to produce tiny wrinkles {{on the face of the}} mirror too small to be observed by the eye. Although his explanation of different cooling rates was incorrect, he was right to suggest the surface contained minute variations which the naked <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> not detect; these mirrors also had no transparent quality at all, as discovered by British scientist and mathematician William Bragg in 1932.|$|E

500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Today, Muybridge {{is known}} for his {{pioneering}} work on animal locomotion in 1877 and 1878, which used multiple cameras to capture motion in stop-motion photographs, and his zoopraxiscope, a device for projecting motion pictures that pre-dated the flexible perforated film strip used in cinematography.

[...] The FAA still recommends, [...] "a pilot should close one eye when using a light to preserve some degree of night vision".
