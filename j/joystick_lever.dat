Due to the binary nature of keyboards (the key is either depressed or not), there's no possible way to move slower than the maximum move speed. With the analog type of the recommended joysticks for the A3D, the player can apply less or more force to the <b>joystick</b> <b>lever</b> and get a similar percentage of his full-speed in game, basically allowing him the fine control needed to strafe-aim.|$|E
40|$|Wheelchairs are {{tools that}} are used {{by people who have}} {{difficulty}} walking on legs, whether caused by disease, injury, or disability, it be mobilized with a manual like being pushed by others, moved by hand, or by using the wheel electrically actuated electric motor. The purpose of making this omnidirectional wheelchair prototype to develop a model of the wheelchair and makes the wheelchair user to be comfortable when using them. As well as how to use easily by directing the <b>joystick</b> <b>lever</b> to move the wheelchair. The joystick is also used for addition and subtraction speed, by pressing the center of the joystick. For speed is set at 1 to 10 but when it begins starting at a rate of 5. In this omnidirectional wheelchair prototype are the main components such as joysticks, arduino, driver motors, dc motors, and omnidirectional wheels with 4 -wheel drive configuration. There are some movements as a result on prototype wheelchair testing, they are moving oblique, sideways, forward, backward and turning. It can be oncluded that the use of the wheel omnidirectinal affect free movement in all directions. Keywords: Omnidirectional Wheel, Prototype, Wheelchairs...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) data should be interpreted in combination and {{in the context of}} relevant behavioral measurements. However, the strong magnetic environment of MRI scanner and the supine position of participants in the scanner significantly limit how participants' behavioral responses are recorded. This paper presents the design of a low-cost handheld response system (HRS) with a multi-configurable optomechanical design that utilizes a reflective-type intensity modulated fiber-optic sensor (FOS) and a programmable visual interface to accurately gather participants' behavioral responses during an fMRI experiment. Considering the effects of an input unit design on the participants' performance efficiency across age groups and physical and neurological (dis) ability, the optomechanical system is designed to provide flexibility in the range of an input module with easy change-out feature. Specifically, the input unit can be configured as a binary module such as push buttons or as an analog input device including a scrolling wheel, and one-dimensional <b>joystick</b> (<b>lever</b> arm). To achieve MRI-compatibility, all parts of the unit that are used inside the scanner bore are built from nonferromagnetic and off-the-shelf plastic materials. The MRI compatibility was evaluated on a 3. 0 Tesla MRI scanner running echo planar imaging (EPI) and the average time-variant signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) loss is limited to 2 %...|$|E
40|$|Human Computer Interaction (HCI) {{is central}} for many applications, {{including}} hazardous environment inspec-tion and telemedicine. Whereas {{traditional methods of}} HCI for teleoperating electromechanical systems in-clude <b>joysticks,</b> <b>levers,</b> or buttons, our research focuses on using electromyography (EMG) signals to improve intuition and response time. An important challenge is to accurately and efficiently extract and map EMG sig-nals to known position for real-time control. In this pre-liminary work, we compare the accuracy and real-time performance of several machine-learning techniques for recognizing specific arm positions. We present results from offline analysis, as well as end-to-end operation using a robotic arm...|$|R
50|$|Though various {{synthesizer}} {{manufacturers have}} used many {{other types of}} left hand controllers over the years—including <b>levers,</b> <b>joysticks,</b> ribbon controllers, and buttons—the pitch and mod wheels introduced on the Minimoog have become de facto standard left-hand controllers, and have since been used by almost every major synthesizer manufacturer, including Korg, Yamaha, Kawai, and (now defunct) Sequential Circuits on their ground-breaking Prophet-5 programmable polyphonic synthesizer (1977). A notable exception is the Japanese manufacturer Roland, who have typically never included Pitch and Modulation wheels as the primary controller on any synthesizer, instead including alternative controllers of their own design. However, they included the wheels as secondary controllers on their JD-XA synthesizer and as the primary controller on their JD-Xi synthesizer.|$|R
40|$|Forests {{represent}} one of {{the biggest}} terrestrial ecosystems of Earth, that can produce important raw renewable materials such as wood with the help of sun, air and water. To efficiently extract these raw materials, the tree harvesting process is highly mechanized in developed countries, meaning that advanced forestry machines are continuously used to fell, to process and to transport the logs and biomass obtained from the forests. However, working with these machines is demanding both mentally and physically, which are known factors to negatively affect operator productivity. Mental fatigue is mostly due to the manual operation of the on-board knuckleboom crane, which requires advanced cognitive work with two <b>joystick</b> <b>levers,</b> while the most serious physical strains arise from cabin vibrations. These vibrations are generated from knuckleboom crane vibrations as a result of aggressive manual operation. To enhance operator workload, well-being, and to increase productivity of the logging process, semi-automation functions are suggested, which are supervised automatic executions of specific work elements. Some of the related issues are addressed in the current thesis. Therefore, the content is divided into: (1) the design and development of a semi-automation function focused only on the base joint actuator (slewing actuator) of a knuckleboom crane, and (2) active vibration damping solutions to treat crane structure vibrations induced by the main lift cylinder (inner boom actuator). The considered reference machine is a downsized knuckleboom crane of a forwarder machine, which is used to pick up log assortments from a harvesting site. The proposed semi-automation function presented in the first part could be beneficial for operators to use during log loading/unloading scenarios. It consists from a closed-loop position control architecture, to which smooth reference slewing trajectories are provided by a trajectory planner that is automated via operator commands. The used trajectory generation algorithms are taken from conventional robotics and adapted to semi-automation context with proposed modifications that can be customizable by operators. Further, the proposed active vibration damping solutions are aimed to reduce vibrations of the knuckleboom crane excited by the inner boom actuator due to aggressive manual commands. First, a popular input shaping control technique combined with a practical switching logic was investigated to deal with the excited payload oscillations. This technique proved to be useful with a fixed crane pose, however it did not provide much robustness in terms of different link configurations. To tackle this problem an H 2 -optimal controller is developed, which is active in the pressure feedback-loop and its solely purpose is to damp the same payload oscillations. During the design process, operator commands are treated and explained from input disturbance viewpoint. All of the hypothesis throughout this thesis were verified with extensive experimental studies using the reference machine...|$|R
5000|$|The D11R and D11R Carrydozer were {{introduced}} at the Las Vegas, Nevada at MINExpo International 1996. Both were [...] {{and that would}} be increased to [...] later in 1997. Other improvements made to the D11R were Fingertip Controls and Electronic Clutch and Brakes. The Finger Tip Controls (FTC) allowed the D11R to be steered with a single <b>lever</b> (<b>joystick)</b> on the left hand side. The D11R now weighed 230935 lb. The Carrydozer version has a special blade with a curvature that allowed 57 yd to be pushed. The [...] "Carrydozer" [...] had the structure strengthened considerably for the extra weight and much bigger blade that it carried up front. Both D11Rs received a new Caterpillar 3508B EUI diesel engine with electronic controls at 915 gross hp. The Carrydozer versions weight is just over 120 tons at 248,600 pounds. According to Caterpillar by the year 2000 over 3,000 D11s had been produced at their plant in East Peoria.|$|R
