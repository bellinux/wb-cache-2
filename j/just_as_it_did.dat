25|$|Baseball {{had been}} watched live {{since the mid}} 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s {{increased}} attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch Maury Wills rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as it always did, made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.|$|E
25|$|After Congress {{passed the}} Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, 1994), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, 1996), and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA, 1996), the FBI {{followed}} suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> with its CART team in 1991. Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) {{were created to}} deal with the increase in Internet-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened US operations. With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.|$|E
25|$|With {{the wars}} raging in Europe, Madison tried to {{maintain}} American neutrality, {{and insisted on}} the legal rights of the U.S. as a neutral party under international law. Neither London nor Paris showed much respect, however, and the situation deteriorated during Jefferson's second term. After Napoleon achieved victory at over his enemies in continental Europe at the Battle of Austerlitz, he became more aggressive and tried to starve Britain into submission with an embargo that was economically ruinous to both sides. Madison and Jefferson also decided on an embargo to punish Britain and France, forbidding American trade with any foreign nation. The embargo failed in the United States <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in France, and caused massive hardships {{up and down the}} seaboard, which depended on foreign trade. The Federalists made a comeback in the Northeast by attacking the embargo, which was allowed to expire just as Jefferson was leaving office.|$|E

500|$|Oort {{noted that}} the number of {{returning}} comets was far less than his model predicted, and this issue, known as [...] "cometary fading", has yet to be resolved. No dynamical process are known to explain the smaller number of observed comets than Oort estimated. Hypotheses for this discrepancy include the destruction of comets due to tidal stresses, impact or heating; the loss of all volatiles, rendering some comets invisible, or the formation of a non-volatile crust on the surface. Dynamical studies of hypothetical Oort cloud comets have estimated that their occurrence in the outer-planet region would be several times higher than in the inner-planet region. This discrepancy {{may be due to the}} gravitational attraction of Jupiter, which acts as a kind of barrier, trapping incoming comets and causing them to collide with it, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> with Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E

The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management told me she wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and I love what she's doing. You got to embrace it!

2500|$|No {{historian}} {{is likely}} to deny that David's early career was largely manufactured for him by King Henry I of England. David was one of Henry's [...] "new men", and his [...] "greatest protégé"; Henry's influence had brought David his English marriage and lands, and Henry's military power had allowed David to take up his Scottish lands. David's early career {{can be understood as}} part of Henry's frontier policy, which included marriage of two daughters to the kings of Scotland and Galloway, consolidation of royal control in the north-west coast of England and the quelling of the Montgomeries, marcher lords on the Welsh borders who had been allied to Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (1101–19).

2500|$|On 8 August 1940, {{less than}} two months into the occupation, Ambrose Sherwill, President of the Controlling Committee of Guernsey, {{broadcast}} on German radio that, while the Channel Islanders remained the [...] "intensely loyal subjects" [...] of the British Sovereign, the behaviour of the German soldiers on Guernsey was [...] "exemplary" [...] and he was grateful for their [...] "correct and kindly attitude." [...] He affirmed that the leaders of the Guernsey government were being treated with courtesy by the German military. [...] Life, he said, was going on <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> before the occupation. Sherwill's objective was to ease the minds of relatives in Britain about the fate of the islanders. [...] German authorities made propaganda usage of his broadcast.

2500|$|Preparations for {{receiving}} {{the bodies of}} the USS Maine began in June 1911. Captain James D. Tilford and undertaker Oliver B. Jenkins of Washington, D.C., took charge of the remains in Havana. They were assisted by the Maine former chaplain, Father John Chidwick. Their plan was to place each set of remains in a coffin, which would be kept under guard at the La Cabaña fortress. The assumption of many involved in the operation was that the USS Leonidas would take the remains to the United States (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> other relics from the ship). Tilford and Jenkins ordered 25 coffins from the United States, believing that most of the 75 missing bodies had been blown far out into the harbor by the explosion and would not be recovered.

2500|$|All the {{survivors}} of the Light Brigade were now behind the Russian guns in the valley, yet the turning point of the action was the realisation that Lucan and the Heavy Brigade was not following in support. Russian officers, noticing how vastly superior their numbers were, managed to halt their retreat near the Chernaya, and edge forward their men. The Russian lancer regiments waiting on heights were now ordered down into the valley to form a line behind the British (the 13th, 17th, and 8th on the right of the valley, the 11th and 4th on the left) and block their route of escape. Those watching with Raglan thought the Light Brigade completely lost, but unexpectedly the two groups of survivors managed to break through the Russian trap. Still far from the British line, however, they once again came under fire from the guns and marksmen on the Causeway Heights. [...] "The truth must be told," [...] recorded Lieutenant Koribut Kubitovich, [...] "that this fire hit us <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> the enemy," [...] but admitted that, [...] "The English fought with astounding bravery, and when we approached their dismounted and wounded men, even these refused to surrender and continued to fight till the ground was soaked with their blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|David's {{relationship}} with England and the English crown {{in these years}} is usually interpreted in either or both of two ways. Firstly, his actions are understood in relation to his connections with the King of England. No historian is likely to deny that David's early career was largely manufactured for him by King Henry I of England. David was the latter's [...] "greatest protégé", one of Henry's [...] "new men", Henry's influence had brought David his English marriage and lands, and Henry's military power had allowed David to take up his Scottish lands. David's early career {{can be understood as}} part of Henry's frontier policy, which included marriage of two daughters to the kings of Scotland and Galloway, consolidation of royal control in the north-west coast of England and the quelling of the Montgomeries, marcher lords on the Welsh borders who had been allied to Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (1101–19). The world of peace which David had enjoyed in England ended after the death of Henry I, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> for most other English magnates. His hostility to Stephen can be interpreted as an effort to uphold the intended inheritance of Henry I, the succession of his daughter, the former empress-consort Matilda. David indeed carried out his wars in her name, joined her when she arrived in England, and later knighted her son, the future Henry II.|$|E
