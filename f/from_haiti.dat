5|$|In nearby Haiti, {{the damage}} from the {{hurricane}} was catastrophic as torrential rains, reported to have exceeded , triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the country.

Several days after the hurricane's passage, reports began to indicate that immense damage had taken place due to the storm. The city of Gonaïves was completely flooded after a nearby river overflowed its banks. Residents sought safety from the flood waters in the upper floors and roofs of their homes. Sixteen {{people were killed in}} the city after a bridge was destroyed by the swollen river. The Tonazeau River near Port-au-Prince also topped its banks, inundating nearby areas.|$|E

Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in the occupied territories, and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops <b>from</b> <b>Haiti</b> and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 3 February 1812 was {{an unusual}} minor naval {{engagement}} off the western coast of Haiti between a British frigate and a frigate manned by a loose coalition of Haitian rebels. The battle was fought {{against the background of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of government in Haiti {{in the aftermath of the}} Haitian Revolution eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled <b>from</b> <b>Haiti</b> in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by Jérôme Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called Sud. The small Haitian Navy defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.|$|E
5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,C yr Record of Climate and Vegetation Change <b>from</b> <b>Haiti</b> |journal=Quaternary Research|volume=52|issue=2|pages=159–170 |doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2062|bibcode = 1999QuRes..52..159H|author2= Brenner, Mark|last3=Hodell|first3=David A.|last4=Curtis|first4=Jason H. |last5=Leyden |first5=Barbara W.|last6=Binford|first6=Michael W. }} and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E
