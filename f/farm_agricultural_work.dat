40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem with classifying agriculturally related injury {{is that there}} is neither a rational nor a comprehensive scheme for grouping incidents into categories describing actual exposures encountered on <b>farms</b> and in <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> Current surveillance systems are unable to differentiate between work that is related to farm production and work that is not, and to include all exposed persons in the surveillance. The proposed <b>Farm</b> and <b>Agricultural</b> Injury Classification Code is a step toward overcoming these problems. When it was applied to previously analyzed fatality data, 40 % of cases previously identified as farm production work were reclassified into other categories...|$|R

40|$|Care farming {{includes}} using farms, {{farm work}} and animals, and agricultural and horticultural activities for improving {{human health and}} quality of life. It {{has its roots in}} involving patients in <b>farm</b> and <b>agricultural</b> <b>work</b> within large health and social care institutions in the past. It also originates from rural self-help systems, which used to employ disadvantaged individuals on farms. Modern care farming is a part of multifunctional agriculture, which offers services beyond mere production of food and fabric. From the care part it comes from the search for new possibilities of therapy, rehabilitation and integration of disabled and disadvantaged people, within the process of deinstitutionalisation of care. Some countries have developed this concept with research conducted at both national and international levels. Care farming has been mostly a bottom-up approach that arose spontaneously from individuals' and organizations' pursuits. If the number of care farming providers is higher in a country they tend to create a network to cooperate better and share experience. I describe the situation in Norway and the United Kingdom. Care farming is provided by farms or social/health care organizations as a means of service. Frequent target groups are people with mental health problems, learning difficulties, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Bihar {{has a large}} agrarian {{economy of}} over Rs 250 billion with more than 80 percent of rural {{population}} subsisting on <b>farming.</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>work</b> force increased more than two-fold from 126 lakh in 1981 to 265 lakh in 2006 whereas net sown area declined by about one lakh hectares and gross cropped area has been stagnating at 80 lakh hectares during the period. Due to increase in number of agricultural labour force in Bihar, per agricultural worker annual real productivity (at 1980 prices) has declined from Rs 1977. 00 in 1980 - 81 to Rs 1278. 00 in 2005 - 06. Among the major states in India, Bihar is at the lowest ladder in terms of proportion of institutional loan to total loan disbursement to farmers. The high indebtedness to money lenders {{may be an important}} reason for indifferent attitude of farmers towards lending institutions, resulting in low investment and low productivity in Bihar. An assessment of the situation at ground level indicates that recourse to non-institutional credit continues to dominate as far as rural areas and agriculture sector are concerned. The study recommends interest rate on co-operative agricultural loans be reduced to 3 per cent in Bihar for benefit of farmers. It will motivate farmers to approach cooperatives for agricultural loans who are still not inclined to contact commercial bank branches. Agricultural insurance offers protection against losses caused by fluctuations in the output of a crop from one year to another or from one crop season to another. Its objective is to stimulate and support the production of principal crops in the country. Providing financial support to farmers in the event of crop failure, it makes farmers credit-worthy for the next crop season. It has been observed that the majority of small and marginal farmers, as well as tenant farmers and farm laborers bear the brunt of crop failure. However, the performance of National Agricultural Insurance Scheme has also been unsatisfactory in Bihar. Despite change in form of crop insurance scheme and establishment of Agricultural Insurance Company Ltd. the regional disparities in crop insurance still persist. It is accordingly recommended that a campaign be launched in rural areas to create awareness among farmers about crop insurance involving, inter alia, non-loan taking farmers because a large number of farmers are still {{not in a position to}} avail crop loan facility from institutional agencies in Bihar. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{provides}} an overview of the health farm - Green Care. In the Czech Republic, Green Care farms are not widespread, but in some areas, such as social services these farms can be found. Green Care means the use of care <b>farms,</b> carrying out <b>agricultural</b> <b>work,</b> care for animals, plants - all to support human health and improve quality of life. Green care utilizes knowledge of multifunctional agriculture, which offers services beyond the production itself. The different forms of green car in the Czech Republic and other countries are discussed. The main forms of therapy are presented. The original research was made by the questionnaire on the two localities (STROOM Dub and Chráněná dílna). The personal dialog was made with the director of farms, social farmerettes and clients. The data from original research are sparse for statistical analysis.

40|$|The hazards {{associated}} with farming {{have been well}} described for over 50 years {{in terms of the}} number of injuries. Despite this, there continue to be problems with interpretation f the patterns of injury and risk due to methodologic problems with the reported work. Specifically, use of denominators toclarify risk patterns are rare and sometimes not appropriate, definitions of farm work are usually absent, and coding on death certificate data is not adequate to identify farm work related injuries. Therefore, results of research cannot necessarily be compared. A number of researchers have worked to develop standard techniques for identification of <b>farm</b> or <b>agricultural</b> production <b>work</b> related injuries and to ensure use of appropriate denominators in the calculation of rates. The p~pose of this paper is to discuss the methodologic ssues, consequences of the choices researchers have made, and present information which will be useful in identifying methods which will allow comparisons of study results...|$|R
40|$|Despite of the {{important}} role international migration fills in the United States’ labor-intensive agricultural sector, few studies have addressed the individual characteristics and circumstances surrounding entry and exit by farm laborers. With increasing public attention on international migrant labor, policymakers have a {{need to understand the}} labor market patterns of these workers if they are to formulate appropriate immigration reforms, including temporary worker programs geared towards agriculture. In this analysis, we model the likelihood of entering agricultural employment by migrants to the United States. Using data from the Mexican Migration Project we find that migrants with higher levels of education and a greater command of English are less likely to <b>work</b> as <b>agricultural</b> laborers. Those that do enter agricultural occupation stay in the United States for shorter periods of time per trip than those who enter non-agricultural occupation. In future analysis we will attempt to model the demand for <b>agricultural</b> <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> as a determinant of the decision by migrants to enter the U.

5000|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the {{majority}} of working men in Tilehurst were employed in <b>farming</b> or similar <b>agricultural</b> <b>work.</b> [...] The main industry associated with Tilehurst, however, was the manufacture of tiles. This industry present in the district until recent times; the 1881 UK census listed a number of men as being employed as brickmen in kilns in the area. [...] Written evidence of brickwork {{can be traced to}} the 1600s, but with the peak of production at around 1885. Kilns were established at Grovelands and Kentwood—both to the east of the settlement—with clay pits being dug on Norcot Hill in an area now known as The Potteries. An overhead cable was used to transport the clay-filled buckets between the pits and the kiln across Norcot Road; this was shown on a 1942 map of the area as an [...] "aerial cable" [...] running from the clay pit in Kentwood to Grovelands works approximately 1.5 mi away. [...] The cable was also included on the 1940s Ordnance Survey New Popular Edition maps, labelled as an [...] "aerial ropeway". An 1883 Ordnance Survey map of Berkshire shows a number of kilns in the Grovelands area (on the present-day Colliers Way estate) and one in Norcot near the present-day Lawrence Road. [...] The latter was more specifically named in the 1899 Pre-WWII 1:2,500 scale Berkshire map as [...] "Norcot Kiln, Brick and Tile Works".
