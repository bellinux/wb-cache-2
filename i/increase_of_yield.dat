This included not only a rise in sugar beet crops, but also other types of agricultural production {{were expected to be}} utilised by industry (with even cotton plants being established in 1931). This plan anticipated a decrease in the area of grain cultivated, in contrast to an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and area for other crops. By July 1, 1931, 65.7% of Ukrainian peasant households and 67.2% of arable land were reported as [...] "collectivized".

50|$|With an {{increasing}} population, {{the production of}} food needs to increase with it. It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 {{in order to meet}} the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold. This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.|$|E

30|$|First, we {{analyze the}} {{necessary}} stress for dislocation nucleation at surfaces versus that for dislocation penetration of twin boundaries, {{the latter being}} stress for yielding. According to Zhu et al. [24], dislocation nucleation stress or activation volume depends on surface conditions. With square cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is low, and additional stress is necessary for dislocations to penetrate twin boundaries. Therefore, the presence of twin boundaries leads to <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress, as shown in Fig. 2. With circular cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is high, and this stress suffices for yielding also. Therefore the presence of twin boundaries leads no <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress. In addition, this presence introduces intersections of twin boundaries and surfaces and thereby reduces the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation; this necessary stress is the highest for non-twinned nanowire.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} on {{solution}} and precipitation hardening of two-phase gamma titanium aluminides was directed towards improved creep resistance. Alloys were systematically doped with carbon up to 0. 37 atomic percent. Solid solutions and precipitates of carbon were formed by different thermal treatments. The hardening obtained {{as a result}} of the different precipitate conditions was measured by deformation experiments between 293 and 973 K. An <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress of up to 300 MPa was observed for finely distributed perovskite precipitates. This <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress was maintained up to 973 K and was shown to be dominantly athermal in character from activation parameter measurements. Electron microscopic investigations confirmed the athermal nature of the perovskite precipitates to dislocation motion. The precipitates thus act as barriers to dislocation glide over a wide temperature range and can therefore increase the creep resistance at the anticipated operation temperature of 973 K. In addition to studying the mechanism of precipitation hardening, the pinning of dislocations by the formation of impurity atmospheres has also been investigated. This phenomenon is effective at intermediate temperatures of around 550 K and is thought to be caused by very mobile elements such as iron and boron. These elements are present in all alloys of technical relevance. (orig.) 158 refs.

It is found that yield strength plays {{a crucial role}} in the thickening of a lava flow of given flow rate. To illustrate this point, downstream thickness profiles and yield strength distributions were calculated for flows with mass flow rates of 10, 000 and 100, 000 kg/m-sec.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a lava flow is studied by a two-dimensional model describing a viscous fluid with Bingham rheology, flowing down a slope. The {{temperature in the}} flow is calculated assuming that heat is transferred through the plug by conduction and is lost by radiation to the atmosphere {{at the top of}} the flow. Taken into account is that the increasing crystallization takes place in the flow as a consequence of cooling. The lava viscosity and yield stress are expressed as a function of crystallization degree as well as of temperature: in particular it is assumed that yield stress reaches a maximum value above the solidus temperature, according to experimental data. Dynamical variables, such as velocity and thickness of the flow, are calculated for different values of the maximum crystallization degree and the flow rate. The model shows how the lava flow dynamics is affected by cooling and crystallization. The cooling of the flow is controlled by the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress, which produces a thicker plug and makes the heat loss slower. The increasing crystallization has two opposing effects on viscosity: it produces an increase of viscosity, but at the same time produces an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> stress and hence reduces the heat loss and keeps the internal temperature high. As a consequence, lava flows are significantly affected by the dependence of yield stress on temperature and scarcely by the maximum crystallization degree...|$|E
