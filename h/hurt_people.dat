The following week on Raw, he defeated Roman Reigns in his main roster in-ring debut after a distraction by Braun Strowman. The same week, {{in an interview with}} Michael Cole, Cole attempted to warn Joe that Triple H turned on prior cohorts. Joe claimed that he was not his heavy, and <b>hurt</b> <b>people</b> only because he has done so for all of his career. He then went on to attack Sami Zayn, who took offense to Joe's remarks concerning him. On March 5, at Fastlane, Joe defeated Zayn by technical submission. Joe then faced Rollins at Payback, in a losing effort, giving Joe his first singles loss on the main roster. Joe retaliated by costing Rollins an Intercontinental Championship opportunity on Raw the following night against Finn Bálor and The Miz, which also saw Bray Wyatt interfere. On the May 29 episode of Raw, Joe defeated Balor and Wyatt in a triple threat match.|$|E

500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to <b>hurt</b> <b>people,</b> but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die.

5000|$|Critic Richard Eder did {{not like}} the film much. He wrote, [...] "The movie has too much plot.

500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a way to get out of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any of us, at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to <b>hurt</b> <b>people.</b> Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E

Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot."

2500|$|Atto was {{captured}} by Task Force Ranger on September 21, 1993, from a location near Digfer Hospital. The Rangers had made an earlier attempt at Atto's capture, but missed him by seconds. In a speech at a church in Daytona, in January 2002, William Boykin, responsible for the operation, recounted, [...] "There {{was a man in}} Mogadishu named Osman Atto... He went on CNN and he laughed at us, and he said, 'They'll never get me because Allah will protect me.'" [...] The arrest was later portrayed in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In an interview with the BBC, Atto indicated that many aspects of the movie are factually incorrect. He took exception with the ostentatious character chosen to portray him; Atto does not look like the actor who portrayed him, smoke cigars, or wear earrings, facts which were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, Atto in reality seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he was not consulted about the project or approached for permission, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies: [...] "First of all when I was caught on 21 September, I was only travelling with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it shows in the film... And when the helicopter attacked, people were <b>hurt,</b> <b>people</b> were killed... The car we were travelling in, and I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times.

[...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and <b>hurt</b> <b>people,</b> they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
