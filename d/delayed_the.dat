5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007.

40|$|The back {{bias voltage}} on a {{functional}} circuit is controlled through a closed loop process. A delay element receives a clock pulse and produces a <b>delay</b> output. <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> element is advantageously constructed {{of the same}} materials as the functional circuit so that the aging and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element parallels <b>the</b> degradation of the functional circuit. As <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element degrades, <b>the</b> transistor switching time increases, increasing <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> output. An AND gate compares a clock pulse to an output pulse of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, <b>the</b> AND output forming a control pulse. A duty cycle of the control pulse is determined by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> time between <b>the</b> clock pulse and <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element output. <b>The</b> control pulse is received at the input of a charge pump. The charge pump produces a back bias voltage which is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and to the functional circuit. If <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> produced by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element exceeds <b>the</b> optimal <b>delay,</b> <b>the</b> duty cycle of the control pulse is shortened, and the back bias voltage is lowered, thereby increasing the switching speed of the transistors in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and reducing <b>the</b> time <b>delay.</b> If <b>the</b> throughput of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element is too fast, the duty cycle of the control pulse is lengthened, raising the back bias voltage produced by the charge pump. This, in turn, lowers the switching speed of the transistors in both <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and <b>the</b> functional circuit. The slower switching speed in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element increases time delay. In this manner, the switching speed of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, and of the functional circuit, is maintained at a constant level {{over the life of}} the circuit...|$|R
