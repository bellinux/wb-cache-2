2500|$|Early on Chesterton {{showed a}} great {{interest}} in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. [...] Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story [...] "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: [...] "There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime." ...|$|E

"Indeed," [...] said Elspeth, {{trying to}} catch and chime in {{with the ideas of}} the Sub-Prior, [...] "I have often thought <b>the</b> miller's <b>folk</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Monastery-mill were far over {{careless}} in sifting our melder, and in bolting it too--some folk say they will not stick at whiles to put in a handful of ashes amongst Christian folk's corn-meal." ...|$|R
