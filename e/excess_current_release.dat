40|$|We {{present results}} from {{point-contact}} measurements on Sr 2 RuO 4 that show a linear {{dependence of the}} <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> {{as a function of}} temperature and applied magnetic fields over a surprisingly wide range of the phase diagram. We propose an explanation of this finding in terms of a p-wave triplet-pairing state with coupling to a low-energy fluctuation mode. Within this model we obtain a quantitative description of the temperature dependence of the <b>excess</b> <b>current.</b> The impact of surface effects on order parameter and <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is addressed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we present an {{analytical}} derivation of the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> in Josephson microbridges, following the Octavio-Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (OBTK) model. We can confirm previously found numerical results, including {{the prediction of}} negative <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> for low transparencies, which might possibly shed new light on questions concerning {{the validity of the}} OBTK approach...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{capture and}} <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> after {{substrate}} hot-hole injection into 60 and 131 A silicon dioxides have been studied. After the hole injection into 131 A oxides, a transient <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> {{appears in the}} gate current-oxide field char-acteristics and electrons are captured even at low oxide fields for the positive gate polarity. The low field electron cap-ture is explained based on the tunneling of electrons from the substrate into the positive charge and neutral trap centers created near the substrate-Si 02 interface. The transient <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is suggested {{to be due to}} the two current compo-nents: the displacement current component due to the electron capture by both the positive charge and the neutral trap centers, and the tunneling current component enhanced by the positive charge located near the interface. In 60 A oxides, <b>excess</b> <b>currents</b> appear for both positive and negative gate polarities after the hole injection, and consist of the steady-state leakage current component and the transient current component. The leakage current induced by the hole injection is increased as the oxide thickness is decreased...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} I-V {{characteristics}} of S_T/n/N contacts, where S_T is a BCS superconductor S {{with a built-in}} exchange field h, n represents a normal metal wire, and N [...] -a normal metal reservoir. The superconductor S_T is separated from the n-wire by a spin filter which allows the passage of electrons with a certain spin direction so that only fully polarized triplet Cooper pairs penetrate into the n-wire. We show that both the subgap conductance ฯ_sg and the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> I_exc, which occur in conventional S/n/N contacts due to Andreev reflection (AR), exist also in the considered system. In our case, they are caused by unconventional AR that is not accompanied by spin flip. The <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> I_exc exists only if h exceeds a certain magnitude h_c. At h < h_c the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is converted into a deficit current I_def. The dependencies of the differential conductance and the current I_exc are presented {{as a function of}} voltage and h. Comment: 7 + pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of integrating various renewable energy recourses in power system requires {{extensive use of}} power electronic solutions, which allows energy conversion between different frequencies and stabilizes the system. Consequently, other than the traditional 50 / 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage stresses act on the high voltage insulation systems. Therefore a need for elaborating fast and accurate characterization methods arises for facilitating studies of {{the different types of}} voltage waveforms on the behaviour of insulation materials and systems. Two commonly applied non-destructive insulation characterization techniques, dielectric response and partial discharge (PD) measurements, are addressed in the project. Several methods based on the so called Arbitrary Waveform Impedance Spectroscopy (AWIS) technique have been developed to enable fast and accurate characterization of dielectric material frequency response. This approach was further adopted to study the behaviour of PDs in various types of test objects, including needle-plate electrode arrangement, twisted pair enamel wires and dielectrically insulated cavities, by simultaneously applying the dielectric response measurements and the stochastic PD detection. Various experiments, involving occasionally changing voltage level, circulating air around a specimen, and modifying conductivity of cavity walls, were performed and allowed identifying additional PD current components in the total current response, which are in the following named as <b>excess</b> <b>currents.</b> It is shown among others, by comparing the <b>excess</b> <b>currents</b> with simultaneously detected PD pulses, that contributions from weak discharges lying below the conventional PD detection threshold as well as slow contributions to the current caused by charge movements within the partial discharge area can be identified and evaluated. An important component of the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is a non-PD <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> that repeatedly appears in all studied types of objects and causes a decay or even disappearance of PD activity with time. At longer exposures of the dielectrically isolated cavities, it also yields oscillating interchanges between PD activity and the <b>excess</b> <b>current...</b>|$|R

40|$|Evidence is that {{tunneling}} via {{states in}} the forbidden gap is the dominant source of <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> in the dark current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of high-efficiency DMCVD grown Al(x) Ga(1 -x) As/GaAs(x is {{equal to or greater}} than 0. 85) solar cells. The dark forward and reverse I-V measurements were made on several solar cells, for the first time, at temperatures between 193 and 301 K. Low-voltage reverse-bias I-V data of a number of cells give a thermal activation energy for <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> of 0. 026 + or - 0. 005 eV, which corresponds to the carbon impurity in GaAs. However, other energy levels between 0. 02 eV and 0. 04 eV were observed in some cells which may correspond to impurity levels introduced by Cu, Si, Ge, or Cd. The forward-bias <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is mainly due to carrier tunneling between localized levels created in the space-charge layer by impurities such as carbon, which are incorporated during the solar cell growth process.

This work applies a measurement system based on dielectric response technique to study an <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> associated with PD activity, which appears during and after PD activity and shows some prominent properties. The value of such a measurement is demonstrated through studies of two types of test objects, twisted pairs and cavity specimens. A simultaneous use of pulse PD detection in the study shows a correlation between changes in PD amplitudes and non-PD <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> levels.

This is achieved through a comparison of currents measured with and without PDs by simultaneously performed conventional pulse PD detection and dielectric response (DR) measurement from which the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> wave shape is deduced.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extensive}} experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} proximity effect in InAs nanowires connected to superconducting electrodes. We fabricate and investigate devices with suspended gate-controlled nanowires and nonsuspended nanowires, with {{a broad range of}} lengths and normal-state resistances. We analyze the main features of the current-voltage characteristics: the Josephson <b>current,</b> <b>excess</b> <b>current,</b> and subgap current as functions of length, temperature, magnetic field, and gate voltage, and compare them with theory. The Josephson critical current for a short-length device, L = 30 nm, exhibits a record high magnitude of 800 nA at low temperature that comes close to the theoretically expected value. The critical current in all other devices is typically reduced compared to the theoretical values. The <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> is consistent with the normal resistance data and agrees well with the theory. The subgap current shows a large number of structures; some of them are identified as subharmonic gap structures generated by multiple Andreev reflection. The other structures, detected in both suspended and nonsuspended devices, have the form of voltage steps at voltages that are independent of either the superconducting gap or length of the wire. By varying the gate voltage in suspended devices, we are able to observe a crossover from typical tunneling transport at large negative gate voltage, with suppressed subgap <b>current</b> and negative <b>excess</b> <b>current,</b> to pronounced proximity junction behavior at large positive gate voltage, with enhanced Josephson current and subgap conductance as well as a large positive <b>excess</b> <b>current.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|In a {{point contact}} NS junction, perfect Andreev {{reflection}} occurs over {{a range of}} voltages equal to the superconducting energy gap, producing an <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> of I_exc = (4 / 3) (2 eฮ/h). If the superconductor has a finite width, rather than the infinite width of the point contact, one cannot neglect superfluid flow inside the superconducting contact. The energy range available for perfect Andreev reflections then becomes larger than the superconducting gap, since superfluid flow alters the dispersion relation inside the finite width superconductor.

40|$|Nonequilibrium {{effects and}} their impact on a charge {{transport}} in superconducting ballistic weak links biased by an ac voltage are investigated {{within the framework of the}} Keldysh technique.

For small bias voltages this effect results in a strong supression of both the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> and the conductance of the weak link. In the opposite limit of large bias voltages the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> remains unaffected.

Detection is designed to probe separately the absorption and emission contributions of current fluctuations, i. e. the positive and negative frequencies of the Fourier transformed nonsymmetrized noise correlator. It relies on measuring the quasiparticles photon assisted tunneling current across a superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction (the detector junction) caused by the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> fluctuations generated by quasiparticles tunneling across a Josephson junction (the source junction). We demonstrate unambiguously that the negative and positive frequency parts of the nonsymmetrized noise correlator are separately detected and that the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> fluctuations of a voltage biased Josephson junction present a strong asymmetry between emission and absorption.
