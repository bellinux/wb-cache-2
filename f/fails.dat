30|$|The {{reason why}} Droptimeout and DropTTL {{increase}} {{is that the}} sensor node that is deployed around the <b>failed</b> sink node keeps sending data in upstream routing to the <b>failed</b> sink node until potential fields converge. When a neighbor node of the <b>failed</b> sink node has data in upstream routing, the node waits for an ID message from the <b>failed</b> sink node. Because the <b>failed</b> sink node cannot send an ID message, the neighbor node of the <b>failed</b> sink node drops the data owing to timeout.|$|R

This scheme allows minimizing the necessary catch memory size for <b>fail</b> classification. A 64 Mbit <b>fail</b> map can be compressed to 2 k allowing classification of 13 <b>fail</b> types. Since catch ram requirements are small, this scheme can be implemented in a manufacturing environment for all processed hardware.

5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then <b>fails</b> suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material <b>fails,</b> straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
