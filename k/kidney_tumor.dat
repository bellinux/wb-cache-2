2500|$|During {{the filming}} of his last Perry Mason movie {{in the spring of}} 1993, Raymond Burr fell ill. A Viacom {{spokesperson}} told the media that the illness might be related to the renal cell carcinoma (malignant <b>kidney</b> <b>tumor)</b> that Burr had had removed that February. It was determined that the cancer had spread to his liver and was at that point inoperable.

2500|$|Lymphoma is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} diagnosed in cats. [...] Lymphoma in young cats occurs most frequently following infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or to a lesser degree feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). [...] These cats tend to have involvement of lymph nodes, spine, or mediastinum. [...] Cats with FeLV are 62 times more likely to develop lymphoma, and cats with both FeLV and FIV are 77 times more likely. [...] Younger cats tend to have T-cell lymphoma and older cats tend to have B-cell lymphoma. [...] Older cats tend to have gastrointestinal lymphoma without FeLV infection, although tests more sensitive to low level FeLV infections and replication-defective FeLV have found that many of these cats have been previously exposed. [...] The same forms of lymphoma that are found in dogs also occur in cats, but gastrointestinal {{is the most}} common type. [...] Lymphoma of the kidney {{is the most common}} <b>kidney</b> <b>tumor</b> in cats, and lymphoma is also the most common heart tumor.|$|E

In the present investigation, the influence of unilateral nephrectomy on the production of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> in rats treated with DMN and basic lead acetate (BLA) was studied. Wistar strain male rats were. divided into the following 7 groups: (1) nephrectomy plus DMN followed by BLA, (2) nephrectomy plus DMN, (3) nephrectomy plus BLA, (4) sham operation plus DMN followed by BLA, (5) sham operation plus DMN, (6) sham operation plus BLA, (7) nephrectomy alone. The animals were given either a diet containing 500 ppm DMN or the basal diet for 2 weeks followed by a 1. 5 % BLA-containing diet or the basal diet for about 22 weeks, and were sacrificed about 24 weeks after the experiment. All the rats treated with unilateral nephrectomy plus DMN and BLA developed <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors.</b> A comparable group of sham-operation rats showed a 75. 096 incidence of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors.</b> Two (18. 2 %) of the rats treated with unilateral nephrectomy plus BLA developed <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors.</b> In contrast, no rats of sham operation plus BLA showed the development of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors.</b> These results indicate that unilateral nephrectomy accelerated the development of rat <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> induced with both DMN and BLA.

The patient is typically placed on the operating room bed lying on the side opposite the <b>kidney</b> <b>tumor.</b> The goal of the procedure is to remove the <b>kidney</b> <b>tumor</b> along with a thin rim of normal kidney tissue. Because the kidneys clean the blood, all blood eventually flows through the kidneys and 25% of it will go into the kidneys with each heart beat. In order to safely remove the <b>kidney</b> <b>tumor,</b> the {{blood flow to the}} kidney is often temporarily blocked off.

Carcinogens in {{cigarette}} smoke, especially nitrosamines, are known to induce <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> {{of a variety of}} histologic types in rodents—but with no evidence of VHL mutations; however, none of these tumors resembled human clear cell carcinomas. We examined N-nitrosodimethylamine-induced <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> of the clear or mixed clear/ granular cell type in Wistar rats to assess the presence of VHL mutations. Methods: Sections of eight clear or mixed clear/granular cell <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> that had been formalin fixed and paraffin embedded were microdissected. DNA was extracted from the microdissected tissue, and exons 1 – 3 of the rat VHL gene were examined by use of polymerase chain reaction and cycle sequencing techniques. Results: Four VHL gene mutations (three G:C to A:T and one A:T to G:C) were detected in three of the tumors in contrast to no mutations in 40 previously reported rat <b>kidney</b> <b>tumors</b> of other histologic types (three of eight tumors versus none of 40; two-sided Fisher’s exact test; P =. 003).
