5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E

There have been previous attempts, trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to obtain semen samples but has only resulted in the penis swelling.|$|E
25|$|This aria poses some difficulties. If sung {{as written}} {{throughout}} (alternative phrases are provided at several {{points in the}} score), there are three high E-flats (above high C), two staccato and one sustained; there are also numerous uses of high C and D-flat. Some of the florid passages are very intricate. Theatrically, it demands an elaborate comic staging, in which Cunegonde adorns herself with jewelry while singing and dancing around the stage, and has a satirical quality that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> perform.|$|E

Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school. Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in University or dating in Nightlife. In Nightlife, each date <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.|$|E
25|$|All-fifths tuning {{has been}} {{approximated}} by the so-called “New Standard Tuning” (NST) of King Crimson’s Robert Fripp, which NST replaces all-fifths' high B {{with a high}} G. To build chords, Fripp uses “perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves”, so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation). It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, {{which is based on}} all-fifths tuning. Some closely voiced jazz chords become impractical in NST and all-fifths tuning.|$|E

Office of Personnel Management <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> Section 3 of DOMA {{in federal}} court based on a {{judicial}} employee's attempt to receive spousal health benefits for her wife. In 2008, Karen Golinski, a 19-year employee of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, applied for health benefits for her wife. When the application was denied, she filed a complaint under the Ninth Circuit's Employment Dispute Resolution Plan. Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, in his administrative capacity, ruled in 2009 that she was entitled to spousal health benefits, but the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) {{announced that it would}} not comply with the ruling.|$|E

A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800kg).|$|E

[...] Ed's adventures featured encounters with penis-worshipping pygmies, flesh-eating rats, Martians, Frankenstein's monster, and other characters from traditional genre fiction. [...] The story unfolds with a black-comedic sensibility topped with Christian symbolism. [...] Despite his ordeals—being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, falling in love with a vampire—Ed remains a gentle, childlike innocent, with a Candide-like optimism. [...] The story has had more than one ending and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> summarize.|$|E

5000|$|Flavin's one-man play, According to Tip, was {{produced}} at Boston's New Repertory Theatre in 2008, starring Ken Howard. It received generally favorable reviews for capturing {{both the public}} and private life of Tip O'Neill, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives. It was awarded “Best New Play of the Year” by the critics and writers that make up the Independent Reviewers of New England. Flavin himself performed in the role on several occasions, and was quoted as saying [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> write about, and will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> portray, such <b>a</b> unique character." ...|$|R
500|$|Chet's face is near expressionless throughout. The {{characters}} are distanced from the reader, inviting neither empathy nor identification. [...] To cartoonist and critic Pepo Pérez, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> readers {{to understand the}} characters. [...] In the appendix to the [...] "New Definitive Edition", Brown declares the dialogue is filtered through his memory and likely did not occur as recorded, and that locations and other details are also subject to lapses of memory. [...] To academic Elisabeth El Refaie this transparency on Brown's part is [...] "a deeper and more sincere form of authenticity". [...] Reviewer C.Max Magee found the tone of awkwardness and emotional emptiness comparable to works by contemporaries such as Daniel Clowes and Chris Ware.|$|E
500|$|W. E. B. Du Bois was incensed by {{news of the}} attack, saying [...] "any talk of {{the triumph}} of Christianity, or the spread of human culture, is idle twaddle {{as long as the}} Waco lynching is {{possible}} in the United States". After receiving Freeman's report, he placed an image of Washington's body on the cover of an issue of The Crisis, the NAACP's newsletter, which discussed the event. The issue was titled [...] "The Waco Horror" [...] and was published as an eight-page supplement to the July edition. Du Bois popularized [...] "Waco Horror" [...] as a name for Washington's lynching; the Houston Chronicle and the New York Times had previously used the word [...] "horror" [...] to describe the event. In 1916, The Crisis had a circulation of about 30,000, {{three times the size of}} the NAACP's membership. Although the paper had campaigned against lynching in the past, this issue was the first that contained images of an attack. The NAACP's board was initially hesitant to publish such graphic content, but Du Bois insisted on doing so, arguing that uncensored coverage would push white Americans to support change. In addition to images, the issue included accounts of the lynching that Freeman obtained from Waco residents. Du Bois wrote The Crisis article on the lynching; he edited and organized Freeman's report for publication, although she was not named in the issue. The article concluded with a call to support the anti-lynching movement. The NAACP distributed the report to hundreds of newspapers and politicians, a campaign that led to wide condemnation of the lynching. Many white observers were disturbed by the southerners who celebrated the lynching. The Crisis included more images of lynchings in subsequent issues. Washington's death received continued discussion in The Crisis. Oswald Garrison Villard wrote in a later edition of the paper that [...] "the crime at Waco <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> our American civilization".|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2008, after {{a meeting}} with the Dalai Lama, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its {{handling}} of the unrest in Tibet and called on [...] "freedom-loving people" [...] worldwide to denounce China.

2500|$|When he {{was asked}} whether tuning in fifths [...] {{facilitates}} [...] "new intervals or harmonies that aren't readily available in standard tuning", Robert Fripp responded, [...] "It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes." [...] To build chords, Fripp uses [...] "perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves", so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation). It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, {{which is based on}} all-fifths tuning.
