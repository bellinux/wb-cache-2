5|$|Around 400 {{people from}} Vukovar's {{hospital}} – non-Serb patients, medical personnel, local political figures {{and others who}} had taken refuge there – were taken by the JNA. Although some were subsequently released, around 200 were transported to the nearby Ovčara farm and executed in {{what became known as}} the Vukovar massacre. At least 50 others were taken elsewhere and never seen again. Thousands more were transferred to prison camps in Serbia and rebel-controlled Croatia. Further mass killings followed; at Dalj, north of Vukovar, where many inhabitants were previously massacred, numerous prisoners from Vukovar were subjected to harsh interrogations, beatings and torture, and at least 35 were killed. The JNA imprisoned 2,000 people at the Velepromet <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> in Vukovar, 800 of whom were classified by the JNA as prisoners of war. Many were brutally interrogated, several were shot on the spot by TO members and paramilitaries, and others were sent to Ovčara where they were killed in the massacre. The remaining prisoners were transferred to a JNA-run prison camp in Sremska Mitrovica, where they were stripped naked on arrival, beaten and interrogated, and forced to sleep for weeks on bare wooden floors. Most were released in January 1992 under an agreement brokered by UN envoy Cyrus Vance. Others were kept prisoner until mid-1992. Serbs who defended Vukovar were regarded as traitors by their captors and treated particularly harshly, enduring savage beatings.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 202 {{crosses the}} Passaic River into Harding Township, Morris County, where the route becomes Mt. Kemble Avenue. The NJDOT {{replaced}} this bridge {{with a new}} bridge built in seven days during August 2012. The new bridge was designed by AmerCom Corporation and built by Joseph M. Sanzari, Inc. utilizing Accelerated Bridge Construction techniques. In Harding Township, the road runs north through mostly runs through wooded residential and commercial areas, closely paralleling Interstate 287, which runs {{to the east of}} U.S. Route 202. It heads into more heavily wooded areas, running to the east of Morristown National Historical Park, before continuing northeast into Morris Township. Here, U.S. Route 202 continues through woodland, but residences start to increase along the road and it passes by an <b>industrial</b> <b>facility.</b> It passes by the Spring Brook Country Club before crossing into Morristown. Upon entering Morristown, the route heads toward the downtown area, where it splits into a one-way pair following Market Street northbound and Bank Street southbound. The one-way pair comes to Park Place, a square in the center of Morristown, where U.S. Route 202 meets County Route 510 and Route 124. County Route 510 heads west from the square on Washington Street and east from the square on Morris Street, while Route 124 heads east from the square on South Street. Meanwhile, U.S. Route 202 continues north from Park Place on Speedwell Avenue, a two-lane road that heads past numerous downtown businesses. The route then leaves the downtown area, heading through residential neighborhoods and crossing the Whippany River before leaving Morristown and crossing back into Morris Township, where it briefly passes through an area of businesses. At the intersection with County Route 650 (Hanover Avenue), U.S. Route 202 crosses into Morris Plains, where it continues north through suburban commercial and residential areas. The route passes under New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line near the Morris Plains Station and intersects the southern terminus of Route 53 (Tabor Road).|$|E

25|$|Proposals for a mill {{came from}} the Norwegian Forest Owners Association, who wanted a major <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> to buy lumber in Central Norway. Originally named Nordenfjelske Treforedling AS, the company was {{incorporated}} on 1 March 1962. Forest owner associations held {{a majority of the}} shares and the mill was long considered part of the agricultural cooperatives. The first lumber was delivered on 1 March 1966 and the first paper machine, PM1, became operation on 15 September. PM2 started running on 14 November 1967. After buying Van Severen and Ranheim Papirfabrikk, the company took the name Norske Skog in 1972 and gradually expanded beyond their inaugural mill at Skogn.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} to visit Skien {{was an air}} show held by Pierre Chanteloup at Gråtenmoen in Solum in 1914. Other aviators used Gråtenmoen for flights from 1918. The first plans for a permanent airport in Grenland was proposed by Norsk Hydro in 1928, during the planning of their <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> at Herøya. At a meeting in on 12 January 1934, hosted by Skien Chamber of Commerce, Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, chief aviator in the newly established Norwegian Air Lines, recommended that an airport be built in Skien. The lecture spurred municipal and commercial interest in an airport, and within days there were carried out investigations of possible sites, notably Gråtenmoen, Vallermyrene and Geiteryggen.|$|E

500|$|Both Compton and Groves {{proposed}} that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-{{proposed that}} the semiworks be {{operated by the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to {{be found at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university [...] would be operating an <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> [...] from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University [...] "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T.

When University President Robert Hutchins returned, he greeted Compton with [...] "I see, Arthur, that while I was gone you doubled the size of my university".|$|E
500|$|The {{regional}} airports only {{received a}} simple terminal and a [...] runway. The first such airports were opened in Helgeland in 1968. Førde was declared as a [...] "center of growth" [...] in 1965, {{which resulted in}} a series of public agencies and industrial enterprises being built in the town. The selection of Førde was tied to its central location within Sogn og Fjordane, as it was within a two-hour drive from nearly the entire county. Immediately after the appointment, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway started establishing an <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> at Øyrane. An industrial park opened 1968, which included a shipyard. The surplus earthwork from dredging the port facilities was used to fill in land for a runway. The process went so quickly that the municipal council had not made a formal decision to build the airport before the groundwork was completed.|$|E

2500|$|The Boiler House was a scare maze first {{introduced}} in 2008, and was situated {{next to the}} Alton Towers Hotel. Originally, the scare maze was set in an abandoned <b>industrial</b> <b>facility</b> and featured live actors in make up. This was changed in 2009, when a new storyline was added. The scare maze later featured the fictional [...] "Hamble Twins" [...] serial killers hiding in the industrial building, and visitors have to escape them as they are chased through the scenes. Visitors queued outside, past a van labelled [...] "Alton News 24", from which television screens play news reports on {{the activity of the}} serial killers. Guests then walk through a covered walkway, which hides the marquee that the maze is contained in from view. Once inside, a man appears and warns guests about the dangers of coming inside. The murderers then appear and kill him, before chasing visitors away. Each of the Twins are played by two different actors wearing the same grotesque, latex mask. They appear at different points in the maze, creating the illusion that one character is in several places at once. Dim lighting and scent effects are heavily used. For the 2011 Scarefest, The Boiler House moved along with the Carnival of Screams to the X Sector, where they both shared the old Black Hole tent. After three years it did not return for the 2012 season.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an <b>industrial</b> <b>facility.</b> [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|E
