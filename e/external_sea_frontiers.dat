On 19 February 1942, a German submarine torpedoed and sank , the first American ship lost to enemy action in the waters of the Gulf <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier.</b> In the summer of 1942, as German submarines took their grim toll of merchant shipping, Turaco pursued her duties. German submarines laid minefields which were discovered by patrolling American vessels - often enough, only after American ships had been damaged or lost. The small coastal minesweepers joined the larger sweepers (AM's) in clearing these fields on the Eastern <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> and Gulf <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier.</b> As the war wore on, Turaco continued her duties with the 6th Naval District and the 7th Naval District. Increased availability of ships and aircraft, improved understanding of antisubmarine warfare, and greater organizational efficiency all contributed to decreasing merchant ship losses on the Gulf <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier.</b>|$|R
