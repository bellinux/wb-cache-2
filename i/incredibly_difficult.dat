25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be <b>incredibly</b> <b>difficult,</b> especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents.

As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E

40|$|LEP {{is today}} {{exploring}} {{the frontier of}} high masses searching for new particles predicted by the standard model, such as the Higgs boson, or predicted by the supersymmetric theory, such as charginos or neutralinos. If this search $ 9 fails, {{the aim is to}} put lower limits of the order of 100 GeV on the mass of each of them. At the same time, more and more precise measurements of the Z and W characteristics allow the mass intervals in which these particles can be $ 9 found to be reduced. The LHC, the future proton-proton collider of CERN, will continue the same searches despite the <b>incredibly</b> more <b>difficult</b> environment, widening the mass interval from 100 to 1000 GeV. For this purpose, the most $ 9 sophisticated detectors ever designed by physicists are now under construction with the participation of groups from throughout the world. This huge increase of the explored mass range guarantees that, if Higgs bosons and $ 9 supersymmetric particles are not found, other scenarios must become evident, opening the road to a new and deeper understanding of the structure of matter and forces.

5000|$|Leonard Woolley (1880-1960), knighted in 1935, was {{a famous}} British {{archaeologist}} {{who was in the}} middle of several seasons excavating the ancient city of Ur when he and his wife Katharine (1888-1945) met Christie in 1928. She was on a solo trip to the Middle East following the painful divorce from her first husband, Archibald Christie. Having read in the Illustrated London News about the progress of the dig, she made a visit there and, unusually for the Woolleys, was made welcome. This special treatment was entirely due to Katharine's admiration for Christie's 1926 novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. The situation was further unusual in that Katharine was not a woman that other women found easy to get on with. <b>Incredibly</b> self-centred and <b>difficult,</b> she preferred to surround herself with men whom she then expected would accede to her demands and whims, such as brushing her hair or walking miles to purchase her favourite confectionery, which she would then eat in one sitting, making her sick.

40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{tested the}} effect of explicit motivation on an errors monitoring system, specifically on a feedback-related EEG peak (FRN). The FRN {{has been shown to}} occur in instances of socially deviant behavior, but it is unclear what specifically motivates this response. One possible motivation is explicit goals. A non-naive group was manipulated to resist conformity and compared to a naive group expected to conform. All subjects completed a face attractiveness task in which subjects rated faces both before and after viewing "average" ratings. Non-naïve subjects were told these averages were fictitious, naïve subjects were told the averages represented the opinions of their peers. We predicted that non-naïve subjects would show decreased conformity as measured by the change in ratings between rating sessions. With respect to the FRN, we predicted an FRN reduction in the non-naïve group, indicating that the FRN is dependent on internal goals. However, if no reduction was found, this would show an independence of error-monitoring from explicit goals. Unfortunately, the manipulation did not reduce non-naïve subjects' conformity behavior nor did it affect the FRN, so the main hypothesis could not be tested. This {{may be due to the}} minor methodological modifications made to this manipulation, though it may indicate that conformity behavior is <b>incredibly</b> resilient and <b>difficult</b> to suppress...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 95 - 104) The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore multilateral marriage as a possible successful alternative to the contemporary family system. A multilateral marriage consists of three or more individuals all of whom regard themselves as married to each other. Descending from the realm of theoretical possibility, multilateral marriage is a new marital entity practiced on a very small scale. Nevertheless, the fact that it is practiced on any scale is of profound significance for the future of marriage and family relations. The participants discussed in this study include members of the Multilateral Relations Study Project, the clients of Dr. Herb Seal, and various groups the investigator had personally contacted or researched through literature in the field. Potential benefits and problems of multilateral marriage are described and analyzed, including jealousy, sex, children, integration into a family unit, and some aspects of the structure and dynamics of the group. The study concludes that multilateral marriage is an <b>incredibly</b> complex and <b>difficult</b> form of marriage, but one offering unprecedented potentials for satisfaction and growth. Most respondents indicated a serious commitment to striving for vital, authentic, and truly equalitarian relationships. While the sexual variety afforded by the relationship was important, perhaps reflecting an intrinsic human propensity for a variety of sexual partners, the respondents perceived the enhanced opportunities for a diversity of deep, interpersonal relationships and the concomitant potential for growth as the central pragmatic benefit of their multilateral marriages. Seeking these ideals, it is likely that some individuals will always favor some kind of multilateral involvement, most in theory, but some in practice. One must conclude, however, that although multilateral marriage is a promising growth oriented form of marriage, it is feasible for only those few persons highly motivated to deal with its structural and emotional complexity. It is unlikely that multilateral marriage will replace monogamy in the foreseeable future or even that a majority will opt for it over the present marital system. In view of the psychological stakes, the emotional cost of dysfunctional models, and the growth and happiness possible in successful ones, it is evident that much more intensive research is necessary in the area of multilateral marriage...|$|R
