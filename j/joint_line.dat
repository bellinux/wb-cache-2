5|$|GPK trains {{used the}} Glasgow and Paisley <b>Joint</b> <b>Line</b> {{as far as}} Paisley; it was joint with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. The line between Shields Junction and Paisley was quadrupled in 1880s. It was reduced again to double track during the mid 1960s. A third track was added once more in early 2012.|$|E
5|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> {{through the}} Denburn Valley {{to link the}} Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E

50|$|PVNS (Pigmented villonodular synovitis): {{is a joint}} {{problem that}} usually affects the shoulder, hip or knee. It can also affect the elbow, ankle, and hand or foot. In {{pigmented}} villonodular synovitis, the synovial <b>joint</b> <b>lining</b> becomes swollen and grows. It may harm the bone around the <b>joint.</b> The <b>lining</b> also makes extra fluid that can cause swelling and make movement difficult and painful.|$|R

25|$|The line {{left the}} City of Glasgow Union Railway (CGUR) at Shields Junction (at {{the point where}} the CGUR joined the <b>joint</b> <b>line)</b> and {{followed}} a course south of that route, running through the southern part of Paisley Burgh and rejoining the G line to Ayr at Elderslie. As the CGUR was controlled by the G, G passenger trains from St Enoch, and goods trains from College, could reach Ayr without the necessity of entering on any part of the <b>joint</b> <b>line.</b> Despite the easing of the worst curvature, the new Canal Line was unsuited to fast running due to the alignment. A loop in the canal was used to hold cooling water for the cotton thread mills at Ferguslie.|$|E

40|$|Pigmented villonodular {{synovitis}} is {{an unusual}} benign tumor of the <b>joint</b> <b>lining.</b> It is most common in the knee, but occasionally occurs in the ankle.

5000|$|The origins {{leading to}} arthrofibrosis are unclear. They {{frequently}} have involved previous knee injury or trauma, such as {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction surgery. [...] More subtle origins of fibrotic contracture in the anterior interval have also been attributed to plica (or naturally occurring folds in the knee <b>joint</b> <b>lining)</b> that become stiff and restrictive.|$|R
25|$|Partly {{because of}} {{disagreements}} with the Metropolitan Railway (MetR) over {{use of their}} tracks {{at the southern end}} of the route, the company built the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> (1906) from Grendon Underwood to Ashendon Junction, by-passing the greater part of the MetR's tracks.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s {{the main}} {{section of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> between Bridge Street station and Paisley Gilmour Street station was {{increased}} to quadruple tracks. The work involved the opening out of the Arkleston Tunnel, which was reported as being carried out in 1882. 260 trains used the section daily at that time—300 in the peak summer period.|$|E
25|$|Goods trains {{started running}} {{on the line in}} March 1885, and the new line opened to {{passenger}} trains on 1 July 1885.

25|$|The GPK {{opened a}} section at its {{southern}} end on 19 July 1839 between Irvine and Ayr (Newton-on-Ayr), {{and it started}} operation on the <b>Joint</b> <b>Line</b> on 14 July 1840 from a temporary station at Glasgow (Bridge Street) to Paisley. The GP opened in March 1841, having been delayed due to the difficulties {{in the construction of}} the tunnel at Bishopton.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Lincolnshire, the new Spalding to Lincoln {{direct line}} opened from Spalding via Sleaford to Ruskington on 6 March 1882 {{and on the}} Lincoln on 1 August, on which date the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway came into being {{comprising}} {{in addition to the}} new Spalding– Lincoln line, the former GNR March to Spalding and Lincoln to Doncaster lines and the former GER Huntingdon to March line plus the Ramsey branch from Somersham. To the GER this was the line to the Yorkshire coal fields they had long been seeking, to the GNR it provided a new alternative line for freight from Huntingdon to Doncaster to relieve pressure on the main line. In the first five months of the <b>joint</b> <b>line,</b> the GNR lost £50,000 due to diverted traffic, but according to Lord Colville, chairman of the GNR, it was better to have half the receipts of a <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> than to have to compete with a new entirely foreign through line.|$|E

The probe is slightly shorter than the weld depth required, with the tool shoulder riding atop the work surface. After a short dwell time, the tool is moved forward along the <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> at the pre-set welding speed.|$|E

In its heyday, there were at least 10 elegant supper clubs and jazz <b>joints</b> <b>lining</b> Springwood Avenue.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1922, {{one year}} before it amalgamated with other {{railways}} to create the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the LNWR amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway {{and at the same}} time absorbed the North London Railway, the Dearne Valley Railway and the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. With this, the LNWR achieved a route mileage (including <b>joint</b> <b>lines,</b> and lines leased or worked) of 2707.88 mi.|$|R
25|$|In 1888 the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway {{opened a}} 6.5miles (10km) line from Giffen on the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway to Ardrossan. Its {{purpose was to}} shorten the route for Caledonian mineral traffic, and it was worked by the Caledonian. In 1903 - 1904 it was {{extended}} eastwards to Cathcart and Newton, enabling the heavy mineral trains to avoid the <b>Joint</b> <b>Line</b> and the congested area around Gushetfaulds from the Lanarkshire coalfields to Ardrossan Harbour.|$|E
25|$|On 22 February 1855 the 6.00 a.m. Dumfries to Glasgow {{train was}} brought to a stand on the <b>Joint</b> <b>Line</b> by a {{derailment}} due to a broken tyre. One of the passenger coaches had its doors locked, and before the guard could release the occupants, the 9.15 a.m. Greenock to Glasgow train ran into {{the rear of the}} train. One person was killed and several were injured. It was stated at the inquiry that the Joint Committee had issued no printed operating instructions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a new {{signal box}} at Quorn opened, {{at that time}} the only {{preserved}} box in the UK with a double track on either side. With this new signal box, a train can, in theory, be dispatched from Loughborough every 10 minutes. A further signal box at Swithland Sidings has been fitted with Great Western Railway style signals, {{in the style of the}} GCR/GWR <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> via High Wycombe, allowing for a further capacity increase on the preserved GCR. The full Swithland project was completed in May 2012.|$|E
5000|$|At Wimbledon, the LSWR had its {{through station}} with four platforms, and the Wimbledon and Croydon had a {{separate}} platform. When the LB&SCR and LSWR <b>joint</b> <b>lines</b> via Tooting were opened, {{there were two}} dedicated [...] "Brighton" [...] platforms: platform 5 (Up Tooting) and 6 (Down Merton). The station had its own approach road from the Broadway, and was managed independently, with a goods yard at the north-eastern end.|$|R
50|$|Very {{similar to}} a Stick system a ladder system has {{mullions}} which can be split and then either clipped, or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate, this allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in shop effectively reducing the time spent installing the system on site. The drawback of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible <b>joint</b> <b>lines</b> {{down the length of}} each mullion.|$|R
50|$|Synovectomy is a {{procedure}} recommended to provide relief from {{a condition in}} which the synovial membrane or the <b>joint</b> <b>lining</b> becomes inflamed and irritated. The synovial membrane encloses each joint and also secretes a lubricating fluid that allows different joint motions such as rolling, folding and stretching. When the synovium becomes inflamed or irritated, it increases fluid production, resulting in warmth, tenderness, and swelling in and around the joint.|$|R
