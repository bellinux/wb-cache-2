25|$|Tayloe’s son, William Henry, {{took over}} Mount Airy in 1828, and its slave {{population}} continued to increase, even as depleted soil led to crop shortfalls and declining profits. So where the Barhams responded to their demographic crisis by buying more slaves and intensifying production, the new master of Mount Airy opted for expansion. He struck out west with his brothers, acquiring cotton fields in Alabama. Between 1833 and 1862, William Henry moved {{a total of}} 218 slaves from white-fenced Virginia to the Cotton South’s slave frontier, a distance of 800 miles. Many of these captives were teenagers, “of the right age to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> cotton.” By this point, with the Atlantic slave trade closed, Virginia had become a net slave exporter; in the early 19th century, there were fewer than a million enslaved people in the United States, mostly concentrated in the coastal and piedmont South. Four decades later, there were four times as many, spread from Charleston to Texas, from Mount Airy to west-central Alabama, where William Henry Tayloe established his new estates.|$|E

500|$|Wisden, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} Australia's post-war record and the West Indies' success during their 1950 tour of England, declared the 1951–52 series {{between the two sides}} to be, [...] "the unofficial cricket championship of the world". Hassett went into the First Test at Brisbane without playing a first-class match for the season due to the scheduling. However, this was negated {{by the fact that the}} tourists only had one match of comparable standard before the Tests, prompting Hassett to make some unusually blunt comments, saying that [...] "The West Indies have suffered from sheer stupidity in the organisation of their tour". Like many of the Australians, he struggled to pick the action of West Indian leg spinner Sonny Ramadhin. He was out for only six in the first innings, as Australia eked out a 10-run lead. He then managed 35 as Australia scraped home in the second innings by three wickets to 7/236. He had been dismissed by Ramadhin both times, bowled and lbw, unable to pick which way the ball was spinning. Between Tests, Hassett had an opportunity to rectify this problem when Victoria hosted the Caribbean tourists, but Ramadhin prevailed again, dismissing him for 12 in his only innings. Having worked out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> Ramadhin's variations, he compiled 132 and 46 not out in a seven-wicket win in the Second Test at Sydney. Hassett's century was part of a 235-run partnership with Keith Miller, an Australian Test record for any wicket against the West Indies. Ramadhin ended with 1/196 and was demoralised. Between Tests, Hassett's Victorians faced New South Wales in consecutive matches. Hassett scored 92 in the first encounter, a high-scoring draw, and his team had the upper hand in the latter, forcing their opponents to hold on with only three wickets remaining.|$|E
