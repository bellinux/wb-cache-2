25|$|Kayla, {{a killer}} whale born in captivity, {{gave birth to}} her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Kayla {{rejected}} her calf, perhaps because she had never been exposed to a young calf before and did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn died unexpectedly on June 15, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Although many around Presley {{were worried}} about his {{worsening}} drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't want to admit {{there was such a}} problem because he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it and was worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did attempt to talk to his client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E

The actress stated that Zombie {{wanted to see}} Laurie Strode travel into [...] "these really dark places". Taylor-Compton clarified that when the film starts Laurie is still not aware that Michael is her older brother, and as the film progresses more and more pieces of information are given {{to her and she}} does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them. The actress explained that the darkness brewing inside Laurie is manifested externally, generally through her physical appearance and the clothes she chooses to wear—Zombie characterized the look as [...] "grungy".|$|E

While Ms. Mudd <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss.

500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

At the first event, Anwesh {{spoke of the}} need {{to break out of the}} Gender Binary. Through the talk, he {{challenged}} a world where sex and gender are often used interchangeably when in reality there exists a clear distinction between the two. He imagines a world where one's identity isn't limited to the binary male or female, but can manifest as a spectrum of infinite possibilities. His second TEDx talk, [...] "Tapping into your Alice," [...] related to growing up in a society that did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> those who did not conform to gender stereotypes, in addition to how adulthood drains us of our belief in magic.|$|E

2500|$|In a video exposé by The Atlantic, Voris stated {{his belief}} that what had led up to his sexual {{behavior}} could be traced to his mother having bipolar disorder. He stated that in his home life with a bipolar parent [...] "Everything in the environment revolves around that mental illness. I wound up believing my parents didn't love me." [...] After {{his mother had been}} diagnosed with stage four cancer, about three months before she died she told Voris, [...] "'I never believed that you were homosexual or gay. I believed that you were acting out in response to the fact of how I had created this situation at home that you didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it.'" [...] Voris said that struck him like a hammer.|$|E
2500|$|Having devoted most of {{his time}} to the {{jurisdictional}} arguments, he asked for some time to speak about the merits near the end. [...] "If we only knew what the school board would have done but for the phone call ," [...] Gottesman suggested, [...] "we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ... <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> this case." [...] The Court should follow precedent from civil-rights and labor law and put the burden of proving that on the defendant. Otherwise, [...] "every school board that wants to fire someone for a First Amendment reason, well ... no teacher can teach for five years without doing something somebody would find objectionable. Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they'll tack on two or three other reasons." [...] At a justice's prompting, he likened it to the harmless error rule in appellate review.|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell's mother, Gloria Jean Cantrell, died in 1987. His {{close friend}} Andrew Wood (of Mother Love Bone) died in 1990, leading Jerry to pen the song [...] "Would?" [...] for Alice In Chains' second album Dirt in Wood's memory. He also {{dedicated}} Alice In Chains' debut album Facelift to Wood, {{as well as}} his late mother. Speaking with Spin magazine in 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song [...] "Sunshine" [...] from Facelift was written about his mother's death. “When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, “I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of you like you took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> it then, and I still don't. But it gave me the impetus to do what I'm doing.” Gloria is also mentioned in the song [...] "Rooster".|$|E

5000|$|Much of 1982 was {{relatively}} quiet {{in terms of}} musical activity. An album of duets was recorded with his lover Clydie King at Gold Star Studios, but it would remain unreleased.

2500|$|Kiedis {{was briefly}} {{kicked out of}} the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis {{completed}} the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Flea has referred to the album as [...] "the 'rockingest' record" [...] the band has ever made. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on the Billboard 200. Following the Uplift tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed. On 28 June 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: [...] "I didn't really <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> that sadness, and I don't think [...] knew {{how to deal with it}} either." [...] Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{women may}} take {{a greater role in}} {{providing}} for the family financially, this does not always mean that men take on a greater share of the housework. Studies on Taiwanese and Korean immigrants in New York found that the distribution of household labor in the home varied with class. In general, husbands in families belonging to the professional class were more likely to take on household work than in those belonging to the working class. Among Chicano families belonging to the professional class, a study found that husbands took on an even greater share of the household labor when compared to professional-class families from other ethnic groups. These studies found, however, that even among immigrant families in the professional class, wives still did the bulk of the work. Among many Vietnamese immigrant families, reproductive labor is still seen as the responsibility of women. In the United States, the scope of this household work is expanded to include dealing with larger institutions like schools, utility companies, and the health-care system. Women may also take over the task of finding housing and dealing with landlords. Language barriers and the threat of feeling powerless may lead men to avoid interactions with such bureaucracies, leaving the job of navigating these complex systems to women. This results in women having superior knowledge of the workings of such systems. Among Vietnamese immigrants, women are often thought of as experts on health-care, and men may defer to women since they have more knowledge of how the health-care system operates. In the case of Vietnamese immigrants, although women were still expected to take responsibility for a disproportionate amount of household-related labor, the change in the nature of such labor gives them the skills and the confidence to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> societal institutions. [...] This knowledge provides women {{with a certain amount of}} leverage within the household and provides them with a greater amount of social and cultural capital relative to men.|$|E
