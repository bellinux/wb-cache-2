5000|$|The abrupt heading {{change after}} the {{aircraft}} descended below minimum altitude may have exacerbated a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b>|$|R
50|$|The program {{results showed}} that the Sprite could be safely {{controlled}} at angles of attack of 30 to 72 degrees and at <b>high</b> <b>rates</b> of <b>descent.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{final report}} of the {{accident}} blamed it mainly on pilot error; specifically the inability to arrest the <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> existing at 50ft altitude on the radar altimeter. [...] The <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> at touch down was 18–20ft/s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{struck the}} building with [...] "a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and low/negligible forward speed" [...] and {{no part of it}} detached in flight. It came to rest approximately upright.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} simulator {{study was}} run to test pilot detection of {{an error in}} autopilot mode selection. Active airline air crew were asked to fly landing approaches by commanding the Flight Path Angle mode while monitoring the approach with both a Head Up Display and Head Down Displays. During one approach, the Vertical Speed mode was intentionally triggered by an experimenter instead, causing a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> below the intended glide path. Of the 12 pilots, 10 were unable to detect the <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> prior to significant glide path deviation...|$|R
50|$|The canard {{configuration}} {{is designed}} so that the forward surface stalls before the main wing, making the aircraft unstallable, and also unspinnable. This does not mean, however, that the aircraft cannot be maneuvered into a flight regime where a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> is achieved.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically {{more complex}} and less {{vulnerable}} to weather conditions that CanSats with parachute or gliders. This kind of gadgets are much more harsh to govern and require an electronic system able to perform many more corrections per second due to its <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the order}} of Spencer, Wagstaff made a mayday call to Madang Tower and gave the aircraft's GPS position. However, instead of {{checking}} emergency checklists and procedures, their attention turned {{to where they were}} going to make a forced landing. The aircraft descended at a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b>|$|R
50|$|When landing from an autorotation, the {{kinetic energy}} {{stored in the}} {{rotating}} blades is used to decrease the <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and make a soft landing. A greater amount of rotor energy is required to stop a helicopter with a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> than is required to stop a helicopter that is descending more slowly. Therefore, autorotative descents at very low or very high airspeeds are more critical than those performed at the minimum <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> airspeed.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian {{board of}} inquiry {{determined}} the probable {{cause of the}} crash to be [...] "Deliberate reduction of engine power by the pilot 12 seconds prior to first impact due to altitude unawareness resulting in a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent,</b> very heavy landing and the undershooting of the aircraft by 1300 feet." ...|$|R
2500|$|Soon after, the {{co-pilot}} continually {{called out}} [...] "go around", likely indicating {{that he thought}} the aircraft would soon crash into something. During the last 14 seconds, the <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> was extremely high. Thereafter the helicopter crashed due to loss of control resulting in <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> in down draught. The helicopter impacted {{the ground in a}} steep left bank and all occupants on board died due to crash injuries.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} determined that due to the <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> of the DC-9, its pilots {{were not able to}} see the other plane in time to avoid a collision. Weather conditions included widely scattered, thin clouds, with haze reducing visibility to 6 to 7 mi, twice the 3 mi visibility required for VFR flight.|$|R
50|$|The thick wing profile gives good {{low-speed}} characteristics (nominal {{stall speed}} approximately 65 km/h or 35 knots). The flight characteristics are docile; its stall is gentle, with ample vibration warning, and is easily recoverable. The nose does not noticeably drop, but the variometer indicates a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and the vibration continues until back pressure is released and stall recovery is initiated.|$|R
500|$|On 11 May 1964, Vulcan B.2 XH535 crashed {{during a}} demonstration. The {{aircraft}} entered a spin while {{a very low}} speed and <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> was being demonstrated. The landing parachute was deployed, stopping the spin briefly before it began to spin again. At around [...] the aircraft commander instructed the crew to abandon the aircraft. The commander and co-pilot ejected successfully, {{but none of the}} rear compartment crew did so, presumably due to the g forces in the spin.|$|R
50|$|March 9, 1967, TWA Flight 553, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet {{airliner}} {{operated by}} Trans World Airlines, {{en route to}} Dayton when it collided with a Beechcraft Baron over Urbana, Ohio. Visual flight rules (VFR) were in effect {{at the time of}} the accident. However, the uncontrolled VFR traffic around Dayton airspace contributed to, also with <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> of the DC-9 prompted, Federal Aviation Administration's decision to create Terminal Control Areas or TCAs (either called Class B airspace and Class C airspace) coordination.|$|R
5000|$|The NTSB {{published}} {{its final}} report on March 12, 1976. In its report, the NTSB determined the following probable {{cause for the}} accident:"The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the aircraft's encounter with adverse winds associated with a very strong thunderstorm located astride the ILS localizer course, which resulted in <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> into the non-frangible approach light towers. The flight crew's delayed recognition and correction of the <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> were probably associated with their reliance upon visual cues rather than on flight instrument reference. However, the adverse winds might have been too severe for a successful approach and landing even had they relied upon and responded rapidly to the indications of the flight instruments." ...|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{conducted}} a simulation {{of the crash}} and found that at 16 seconds before the crash, the spooling up of the engine had reduced the <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b> However, eight seconds later when the Flap Lever was moved to 15, the <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> increased as seen by the steepening of {{the slope of the}} curve. This was caused by loss of lift due to the reduction in wing area as the flaps moved up from 40 to 15. Six seconds after the Flap Lever was moved to 15, the <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> increased even further indicating that the flaps were close to 15 position and the wing no longer generated enough lift to support the aircraft. This <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> together with the high Nose Up pitch attitude held by the Pilot resulted in the aircraft attaining a very high Angle of Attack of the order of 26º. The aircraft had completely stalled by this time and even though thrust had been increased to the maximum possible on both engines, recovery was not possible.|$|R
5000|$|... 30 June 1967 - Thai Airways International Flight 601, a Caravelle III, {{crashed into}} the sea while landing at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport during a {{tropical}} heavy rainstorm. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft, allegedly made an abrupt heading change, causing the aircraft {{to enter into a}} <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and crashing into the sea, {{to the right of the}} runway. The starboard wing broke off and the aircraft lay on its starboard side, the port wing tip protruding from the water. 24 were killed probably because half the escape doors were made useless when the aircraft rolled onto its side.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the flow}} field around a model rotor {{descending}} axially into its own vortex wake have been performed using particle image velocimetry (PIV). At low <b>descent</b> <b>rates,</b> the expected cylindrical down-flow structure below the rotor is observed. At slightly <b>higher</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate,</b> the flow enters the so-called vortex ring state (VRS) where the vorticity from the rotor accumulates into a toroidal structure near the rotor tips, and a large recirculation zone forms above the rotor disk. In the VRS, the flow below the rotor shows a significant upwards component, with a small up-flow zone penetrating {{right up to the}} rotor disk. Measurements show there to be a range of <b>descent</b> <b>rates</b> just before the onset of the VRS over which the flow may be interpreted to be in an incipient VRS condition. In this range, analyses of individual PIV measurements indicate that the flow near the rotor intermittently switches between the down-flow topology found at lower <b>descent</b> <b>rates</b> and the flow topology found in the fully developed VRS. The frequency of excursions {{of the flow}} into the VRS topology increases as the <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> of the rotor is increased until, at <b>high</b> enough <b>descent</b> <b>rate,</b> the flow remains locked within its toroidal state...|$|R
40|$|It {{is quite}} {{important}} that the airplane performance during a continuing headwind loss be understood. Lack of consideration of this characteristic can result in assuming almost twice the performance than that which the airplane actually has during severe wind shear at <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rates.</b> The example data relates to the Boeing 727 - 200, but the characteristics are applicable to any airplane...|$|R
50|$|In {{the lower}} atmosphere, the orbiter flies {{much like a}} {{conventional}} glider, except for a much <b>higher</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate,</b> over 50 m/s or 9,800 fpm. At approximately Mach 3, two air data probes, located {{on the left and}} right sides of the orbiter's forward lower fuselage, are deployed to sense air pressure related to the vehicle's movement in the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|A {{prototype}} S-11, N2164K, {{was involved}} in an accident on 19 January 1991. The aircraft suffered an engine failure caused by a seized piston at altitude. The landing was hard and resulted in a fire. The pilot received serious injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board assessed cause factors as engine failure followed by a <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> on landing. The aircraft is listed as destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Air brakes {{are used}} to {{increase}} drag. Spoilers might act as air brakes, but are not pure air brakes as they also function as lift-dumpers {{or in some cases}} as roll control surfaces. Air brakes are usually surfaces that deflect outwards from the fuselage (in most cases symmetrically on opposing sides) into the airstream in order to increase form-drag. As they are in most cases located elsewhere on the aircraft, they do not directly affect the lift generated by the wing. Their purpose is to slow down the aircraft. They are particularly useful when a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> is required. They are common on high performance military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft, especially those lacking reverse thrust capability.|$|R
5000|$|Vortex ring {{state is}} a hazard induced by a {{combination}} of low airspeed, high power setting, and <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate.</b> Rotor-tip vortices circulate from the high pressure air below the rotor disk to low pressure air above the disk, so that the helicopter settles into its own descending airflow. Adding more power increases the rate of air circulation and aggravates the situation. It is sometimes confused with settling with power, but they are aerodynamically different.|$|R
2500|$|On 30 June 1967, a Thai Airways International Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III {{crashed into}} Victoria Harbour {{while trying to}} land during a torrential rainstorm. A typhoon was some [...] NW of Hong Kong, but the colony was not closed down in {{preparation}} of the typhoon. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft, unable to even see the runway due to {{the density of the}} rain, allegedly made an abrupt heading change, causing the aircraft to enter into a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and crash into harbour waters {{to the right of the}} runway. The starboard wing snapped off on impact, and the aircraft rolled onto its starboard side, halving the number of escape routes. 24 were killed, but only 23 bodies were recovered at the scene. The final body was recovered after it was seen floating in the harbour six weeks later.|$|R
50|$|In a B-line stall, {{the second}} set of risers from the leading-edge/front (the B-lines) are pulled down {{independently}} of the other risers, with the specific lines used to initiate a stall. This puts a spanwise crease in the wing, thereby separating the airflow from the upper surface of the wing. It dramatically reduces the lift produced by the canopy and thus induces a <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b> This can be a strenuous maneuver, because these B-lines have to be held in this position, and the tension of the wing puts an upwards force on these lines. The release of these lines has to be handled carefully not to provoke a too fast forward shooting of the wing, which the pilot then could fall into. This is less popular now as it induces high loads on the internal structure of the wing.|$|R
5000|$|On November 18, 1979, Transamerica Airlines L-188 (N859U), {{operating}} a flight for the US military (Logair 3N18) from Hill Air Force Base, crashed near Salt Lake City airport, Utah. While climbing between 12,000 and 13,000 ft, all electrical power was lost; the crew requested an immediate descent. The aircraft attained a high airspeed and a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and the aircraft disintegrated in flight killing all three crew members. The NTSB investigation stated the probable cause was a progressive {{failure of the}} aircraft electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of flight critical flight instruments and lighting. As a result, the crew became disoriented and {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed loads which exceeded the design limits and caused it to break up in flight.|$|R
5000|$|Thai Airways International Flight 601 {{took off}} from Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA/RCSS) on a flight to Kai Tak Airport. The Sud Aviation Caravelle (Registration: HS-TGI which had its first flight in 1960) had 73 {{passengers}} and 7 crew on board and after a 1-hour flight was on an ILS approach to land on runway 31 at Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG/VHHH). With a typhoon over Hong Kong {{at the time of}} the approach, the Captain was busy looking for visual contact with the ground not noticing that the aircraft had descended below the decision height of 415 ft. The aircraft made an abrupt heading change (while already 80 ft below the glide slope), then entered a <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> and crashed into the sea short of runway 31 under-shoot. The accident killed 24 passengers out of 80 passengers and crew on board.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the flight}} deck, the display units {{are the most}} obvious parts of an EFIS system, and are the {{features}} {{that lead to the}} term glass cockpit. The display unit that replaces the ADI is called the primary flight display (PFD). If a separate display replaces the HSI, it is called the navigation display. The PFD displays all information critical to flight, including calibrated airspeed, altitude, heading, attitude, vertical speed and yaw. The PFD is designed to improve a pilot's situational awareness by integrating this information into a single display instead of six different analog instruments, reducing the amount of time necessary to monitor the instruments. PFDs also increase situational awareness by alerting the aircrew to unusual or potentially hazardous conditions [...] - [...] for example, low airspeed, <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> [...] - [...] by changing the color or shape of the display or by providing audio alerts.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 1967, a Thai Airways International Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III {{crashed into}} Victoria Harbour {{while trying to}} land during a torrential rainstorm.

40|$|A set of {{dimensionless}} variables (modified Chapman's variables) {{is introduced}} in a derivation of general equations for lifting flight and bank modulation within a planetary atmosphere. The atmosphere is assumed spherical and at rest, and a generalized lift-drag polar is also introduced. Corresponding equations for flight over a flat planet model are attained via a straightforward transformation. Two planar flight cases: flight at constant absolute speed over a spherical planet, and flight at constant <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> over a flat planet, are analyzed, and the required lift control law (with negative or positive lift) is exhibited in each case. Glide at very <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> and plane flows of trajectories are analyzed...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the plane}} was a little higher than the normal glide path, Captain Fernandez asked for a <b>higher</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> of 1000 ft / min, instead of the normal rate of 700 ft / min. This faster descent {{increased}} the aircraft speed to 275 km / hr — higher than the recommended speed of 240 km / hr — but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path. The aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode — the correct mode for landing.|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{believe that}} Hughes entered {{an area of}} deteriorating weather with low {{visibility}} and lost his visual reference with the ground. This induced spatial disorientation and eventually led to a graveyard spiral with the aircraft entering into a right-hand diving turn, with a nose-down attitude of 25°. When the aircraft cleared the clouds, Hughes attempted to arrest the <b>high</b> <b>descent</b> <b>rate</b> by pulling the nose up and applying full power, {{but it was too}} late. The FAA investigators later found evidence that the propeller was at maximum speed during impact.|$|R
40|$|The autorotative {{performance}} of an assumed helicopter was studied {{to determine the}} effect of inoperative jet units located at the rotor-blade tip on the helicopter <b>rate</b> of <b>descent.</b> For a representative ramjet design, the effect of the jet drag is to increase the minimum <b>rate</b> of <b>descent</b> of the helicopter from about 1,OO feet per minute to 3, 700 feet per minute when the rotor is operating at a tip speed of approximately 600 feet per second. The effect is less if the rotor operates at lower tip speeds, but the rotor kinetic energy and the stall margin available for the landing maneuver are then reduced. Power-off <b>rates</b> of <b>descent</b> of pulse-jet helicopters would be expected to be less than those of ramjet. helicopters because pulse jets of current design appear to have greater ratios of net power-on thrust to power-off, drag than currently designed rain jets. Iii order to obtain greater accuracy in studies of autorotative performance, calculations in'volving <b>high</b> power-off <b>rates</b> of <b>descent</b> should include the weight-supporting effect of the fuselage parasite-drag force {{and the fact that the}} rotor thrust does not equal the weight of the helicopter...|$|R
