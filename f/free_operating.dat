50|$|Until this point, the GNU project's {{lack of a}} kernel {{meant that}} no {{complete}} <b>free</b> software <b>operating</b> systems existed. The development of Torvalds' kernel closed that last gap. The combination of the almost-finished GNU operating system and the Linux kernel made the first complete <b>free</b> software <b>operating</b> system.|$|R

25|$|Many Linux {{distributions}} {{and other}} <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> systems {{are involved in}} the development and distribution of the software, and are therefore also active in the KDE community. These include commercial distributors such as SUSE/Novell or Red Hat but also government-funded non-commercial organizations such as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey with its Linux distribution Pardus.|$|E
25|$|Independently, in 1991, Linus Torvalds {{released}} {{the first version}} of the Linux kernel. Early Linux developers ported GNU code, including the GNU C Compiler, to the kernel. The free software community adopted the use of the Linux kernel as the missing kernel for the GNU operating system. This work filled the remaining gaps in providing a completely <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system.|$|E
25|$|GNU/Linux {{is a term}} {{promoted}} by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman. They argue that GNU was a longstanding project begun in 1984 to develop a <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system, and that when the Linux kernel was independently created in 1991, it merely provided a substantial missing piece. Several distributions employ the FSF-endorsed name, such as Debian, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.|$|E

25|$|Torvalds {{began the}} {{development}} of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley Software Distribution, commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a terminal control library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X. Eric Allman (BS 1977, MS 1980) created SendMail, a Unix mail transfer agent that delivers about 12% of the email in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Accordingly, {{a number}} of free {{software}} organizations (Free Software Foundation France, EUCD.info, Framasoft, APRIL, AFUL…) [...] lobbied that the DADVSI law should not act as a de facto prohibition on making free software capable of reading formats protected by DRMs, including video and music, and thus making <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> systems unsuitable for personal use. They also noted that copyrighted works also include text, that formats such as PDF also have DRMs, and thus that the law could well exclude free software from desktop processing, since it could perhaps not read the same file formats as the main desktop suites.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Stallman {{published}} the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation {{for creating a}} <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix. The name GNU is a recursive acronym for [...] "GNU's Not Unix". Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts. Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.|$|E
2500|$|Development of the Hurd has {{proceeded}} slowly. Despite {{an optimistic}} announcement by Stallman in 2002 predicting {{a release of}} GNU/Hurd later that year, the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments. Development in general has not met expectations, {{and there are still}} a significant number of bugs and missing features. This has resulted in a poorer product than many (including Stallman) had expected. In 2010, after twenty years under development, Stallman said that he was [...] "not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd. It makes some progress, but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems", but added that [...] "finishing it is not crucial" [...] for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed (Linux), and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system: device support.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{after the}} release of the {{wireless}} products called Intel Pro/Wireless 2100, 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005, Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate. As a result of this, Intel became a target of campaigns to allow <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community. Linspire-Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source, as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft. Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being [...] "an Open Source fraud" [...] after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open-source conference. In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received {{as a result of the}} wireless dealings, the binary firmware [...] still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles.|$|E
2500|$|Unix {{is a major}} {{computer}} operating system, {{developed in}} the United States of America. [...] Prior {{to the events of}} this case, the intellectual property rights (IP) in Unix were held by Unix System Laboratories (USL), part of AT, but the area of IP ownership was complex. [...] By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the Copyright Act of 1976, or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The software company SCO Group (SCO), formerly Caldera International, asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other unix-type operating systems - particularly the <b>free</b> <b>operating</b> system Linux and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies - were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.|$|E
