5|$|Hyundai {{developed}} a warning noise for called the Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS). The system, which {{was introduced in}} September 2010 on its test fleet of BlueOn electric hatchbacks, provides synthetic audio feedback mimicking {{the sound of an}} <b>idling</b> internal combustion engine.|$|E
5|$|The sound modules are {{developed}} {{to give a}} realistic ICE sound impression indicating if the vehicle is <b>idling,</b> accelerating, decelerating or cruising. The different sound characters and sound volume is determined from information about the actual {{speed of the vehicle}} and rate of speed change.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is <b>idling.</b> Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idle</b> speed {{stabilisation}} {{is enhanced}} by {{a process known as}} <b>Idle</b> Speed Control (ISC). This function (previously known as Digital <b>Idle</b> Stabilization), allows the ECM to modify ignition timing at <b>idle</b> to further improve <b>idle</b> quality.|$|R

5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schottâ€™s Sporting, Gaming and <b>Idling</b> Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E
5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already <b>idling</b> in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An often-reproduced painting by Leslie Ragan for the New York Central Railroad depicts streamliner locomotives <b>idling</b> at LaSalle Street Station with the Board of Trade Building looming prominently in the background.|$|E
40|$|Automobile <b>idle</b> {{adjuster}} {{is mainly}} {{used to make}} the <b>idle</b> speed of engine be constant and reduce oil cost when automobile is in <b>idle</b> moving, which can increase <b>idle</b> speed and prevent engine from stopping. Automobile <b>idle</b> adjuster controls <b>idle</b> speed by controlling the mode of throttle valve channel. It also can increase <b>idle</b> speed automatically when the engine load is bigger. This can be happen when the air-conditioning unit, power steering or torque converter is introduced.

5|$|Around 2:45 a.m., Kelly was {{on patrol}} and stopped to {{investigate}} a broken-down car {{on the side of}} the road, which was <b>idling</b> with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle. Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun. Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice, killing him. Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches <b>idling</b> on Park Lane. The widening of the road distanced the houses {{on the east side of}} Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass. Despite the traffic noise the road is still upmarket, featuring five-star hotels (such as The Dorchester, the Grosvenor House Hotel and the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel) and showrooms for several sports car models, including BMW, Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz.|$|E

50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} <b>idle</b> speed control {{built into the}} ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. <b>Idle</b> speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an <b>idle</b> air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an <b>idle</b> air control stepper motor. Effective <b>idle</b> speed control must anticipate the engine load at <b>idle.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Idle</b> periods on {{different}} processes of Message Passing applications are unavoidable. While {{the origin of}} <b>idle</b> periods on a single process is well understood as the effect of system and architectural random delays, yet {{it is unclear how}} these <b>idle</b> periods propagate from one process to another. It is important to understand <b>idle</b> period propagation in Message Passing applications as it allows application developers to design communication patterns avoiding <b>idle</b> period propagation and the consequent performance degradation in their applications. To understand <b>idle</b> period propagation, we introduce a methodology to trace <b>idle</b> periods when a process is waiting for data from a remote delayed process in MPI applications. We apply this technique in an MPI application that solves the heat equation to study <b>idle</b> period propagation on three different systems. We confirm that <b>idle</b> periods move between processes in the form of waves and that there are different stages in <b>idle</b> period propagation. Our methodology enables us to identify a self-synchronization phenomenon that occurs on two systems where some processes run slower than the other processes.

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} a theoretical estimation for <b>idle</b> channel {{time in a}} multi-hop environment. <b>Idle</b> channel time is the time proportion of a node during which the channel state is <b>idle.</b> Thus, {{it can be used}} to evaluate the available bandwidth. Major related work considers a cross-layer model, where the <b>idle</b> channel time measure is available at the MAC layer, but it is rarely implemented. Furthermore, this measure is not very flexible: it cannot differentiate the trafficâ€™s priorities and it works under the hypothesis that flows are strictly policed. Estimating instead of measuring the <b>idle</b> channel time prevents these drawbacks. This estimation is computed in three steps by (1) calculating the <b>idle</b> channel time bounds, (2) evaluating the probability of a given <b>idle</b> channel time value, (3) computing the expected value of this distribution and deducing the average <b>idle</b> channel time. We show by simulation that our estimation is accurate. I...|$|R
