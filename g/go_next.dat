5|$|As 1938 began, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} as to where Briskin would <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> He {{was considered one of}} the top film executives in the industry. In mid-May, it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio, Columbia, in the role of general manager. However, his name was still being discussed for other major positions throughout the industry, such as the production head at Universal Pictures. On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7-year agreement for him to take over {{as the head of the}} production at the studio, where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30. As part of the agreement, Briskin was issued stock options on 10,000 shares of Columbia stock, with a value of $13.875 per share. Briskin's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother, Irving, who had been a producer at Columbia for several years. Samuel Briskin's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938, his earnings topping $106,000, putting him in the top 10 at Columbia.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Klien was {{unsuccessful}} {{in comparison to}} his more experienced teammate David Coulthard, as the Brit scored the team's first podium and was more consistent than Klien throughout the season. In August 2006, {{it was confirmed that}} Klien would not stay with the Red Bull team for the upcoming 2007 season, or at least as a race driver, due to Red Bull's signing of Mark Webber. After the 2 points finishes in Bahrain and Germany, there was some uncertainty as to where Klien would <b>go</b> <b>next</b> in his racing career, speculation suggested America as a logical choice for the Austrian, but he refused a ChampCar seat in a Red Bull-backed team for 2007, preferring to chase a Formula One drive with another team. As a result, the team announced that Klien had been dropped for the last three races of the season in favour of test driver Robert Doornbos.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to <b>go</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to <b>go.</b> <b>Next</b> week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would have to go to the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E

500|$|The game's Campaign mode may {{be played}} alone or cooperatively {{with a maximum}} of three {{additional}} players.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} similarly received mixed opinions; {{a review}} by Eurogamer praised the difficult, [...] "old school" [...] gameplay {{as a successful}} adaptation of the originals, though with minor dislikes of the boss battles and shortness of gameplay, while Sellers of IGN noted the [...] "aging" [...] gameplay that, while sound, did not compare as well to more recent games. GameSpot's Provo termed the difficult gameplay an [...] "acquired taste", and one which was better suited to a system where players could save anywhere, while AllGame's White criticized {{the size of the}} levels, which he felt were ill-suited to the small screen of the Game Boy Color and which led to tedious hunting for where to <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> White, Provo, and Eurogamer all concluded that the game was best suited for fans of the original series or younger players.|$|E
500|$|Development of Spyro: Year of the Dragon spanned {{about ten}} {{and a half}} months, from November 1999 to September 2000; the {{development}} team was influenced {{by a host of}} other games, including Doom and Crash Bandicoot. Among the new features touted before the game's release was [...] "Auto Challenge Tuning", which Insomniac CEO Ted Price described as [...] "invented to even out the gameplay difficulty curve for players of different abilities". The levels were made much larger than those in Spyro 2, so that more areas for minigames could be added; to prevent player confusion on where to <b>go</b> <b>next,</b> these areas were designed to load separately from the main hubs. Price stated that the addition of critters was a way to make the game more enjoyable and varied, instead of just adding more moves for Spyro. The game was named [...] "Year of the Dragon" [...] simply because it was released during 2000, the year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
500|$|After {{the train}} leaves the station, it turns180-degrees right and exits the mountain, leading into a [...] chain lift hill. Once at the top, the train enters a shallow, {{right-hand}} drop and {{runs along the}} side of the mountain. It makes a banked right turn back into the mountain, then a tarpaulin drops, blocking the entrance to prevent light from entering. The train slows and the cars rotate 90 degrees to face the screens. Stansein tells riders to prepare to battle the enemies. The first scene takes place in forest environment where riders fight Sneaky Spiders and Beasty Bats. At the end of the first scene, riders who began the ride facing forward see Stansein's first appearance, in which he points in the direction riders should <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> Backward-facing riders do not see this transition. In the next scene, riders—who are surrounded by a lake inside the mountain—battle Wet Ones and Crazy Crabs. The scene starts above the surface of the water but later moves downwards. As the scene ends, the train passes two waterfalls; this transition is absent for backward-facing riders.|$|E

500|$|The {{design and}} layout of the island in The Witness has been nearly {{consistent}} {{since the start of}} the game's development, with the team working on populating the world with specific puzzles, and detailing the landscape and other art assets. Sam Machkovech, a writer for Ars Technica that had played a demo of the game in 2012 and again in 2015, noted that the island had remained familiar between these two sessions. One aspect of the design of the game world is the use of power cables running across the island, connecting puzzle panels to the mechanics they control. Blow found these to help in the initial parts of the game to provide [...] "extreme clarity" [...] of where the player was to <b>go</b> <b>next,</b> but discovered that this also made the game too much of a grind of repeating the same pattern. Over the course of development, the power cable aspects were still kept, but the designers changed up how easy they were to trace across the landscape as a means to guide the player towards potential objectives.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its deep single-player missions and varied enemy types. Game Revolution highlighted {{the long and}} complex levels, but admitted that players may [...] "" [...] around in circles for hours {{trying to figure out}} where to <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> This may be enjoyable for people who like puzzles and long gameplay, but it is aggravating for more action-oriented players." [...] N64 Magazine gave high marks to the game's level design and explained that the addition of mission objectives [...] "gives the game more focus and betters its predecessor's pretty limited and fairly simple key-collection." [...] The artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than GoldenEye 007s, as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards the player. GamePro also noted that they were more aggressive than Dinosaur Hunters. The game's large arsenal of weapons was also praised, with GameSpot remarking that the Cerebral Bore is [...] "possibly the grossest weapon ever conceived". The multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3D space and innovative game types.|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E
