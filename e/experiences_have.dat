5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{histories}} of refugee students are often hidden from educators, resulting in cultural misunderstandings.

Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E
25|$|Grapheme-color synesthetes, as a group, share {{significant}} {{preferences for}} {{the color of}} each letter (e.g. A tends to be red; O tends to be white or black; S tends to be yellow etc.) Nonetheless, {{there is a great}} variety in types of synesthesia, and within each type, individuals report differing triggers for their sensations and differing intensities of experiences. This variety means that defining synesthesia in an individual is difficult, and the majority of synesthetes are completely unaware that their <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> a name.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} physiological explanations for {{parts of the}} OBE. OBE-like <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> been induced by stimulation of the brain. OBE-like experience has also been induced through stimulation of the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus in a patient. Positron-emission tomography was also {{used in this study}} to identify brain regions affected by this stimulation. The term OBE-like is used above because the experiences described in these experiments either lacked some of the clarity or details of normal OBEs, or were described by subjects who had never experienced an OBE before. Such subjects were therefore not qualified to make claims about the authenticity of the experimentally-induced OBE.|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|Experimental method: This {{method is}} an {{experimental}} paradigm {{used to study}} human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience {{to see if it}} can be generalized.|$|E

25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

500|$|According to Beverley Driver Eddy, The Land of Green Plums {{presents}} trauma {{as well as}} its testimony; {{the narrator}} gives her own testimony, and relates it to the testimony of her friends' suffering. The first of these is Lola, the friend who supposedly kills herself; her testimony is preserved in her diary, in which she wrote of her animalistic sexual exploits with nameless men and her struggle to cope with the guilt of having joined the Communist Party in an effort to better herself. For the narrator, preserving Lola's notebook (and sharing it with her three friends) becomes of paramount importance, especially since the memory of Lola was erased days after her death by the Party establishment. Additional complexity comes from Lola's testimony being interwoven in the narrator's own—"a testimony within a testimony." [...] In an interview published in 1998, Müller said that [...] "she is concerned with showing that the childhood <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> been internalised by the narrator, and that the traumas of the frightened, non-conformist child are replicated to the larger traumas of the adult dissident." [...] In the image of the weeds cut down by the narrator's father, an image presented early in the novel, the parallel between the father and the dictator is evidenced: [...] "both 'make cemeteries' without fear of retribution." [...] One symptom of the trauma this causes in its victims is disconnection, the strain of friendship resulting from lack of trust, disrupting normal human relationships {{for the remainder of the}} victim's life. Müller's novel portrays this disconnection and the ongoing trauma for survivors, even after the fall of the dictatorship.|$|E

2500|$|Apparitional <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> {{relevance}} to psychological theories of perception, {{and in particular}} to the distinction between top-down and bottom-up approaches (cf. article on Top-down and bottom-up design). [...] Top-down theories, {{such as that of}} Richard Langton Gregory, who conceives of perception as a process whereby the brain makes a series of hypotheses about the external world, stress the importance of central factors such as memory and expectation in determining the phenomenological content of perception; while the bottom-up approach, exemplified by the work of James J. Gibson, emphasises the role of the external sensory stimulus.|$|E

In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast Daniela Silivaş, whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: [...] "One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices." ...|$|E
2500|$|As is {{the case}} the more {{generalized}} forms of social anxiety, intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory. Additionally recent {{research has found that}} implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction. Negative <b>experiences</b> <b>have</b> been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or [...] antagonistic, behavior such as hostility. Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.|$|E
