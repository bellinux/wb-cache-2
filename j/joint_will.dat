25|$|For instance, needle {{aspiration}} {{of fluid}} from a gouty <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> reveal negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence. Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel {{to that of}} a red compensator filter, or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, the Caproni Museum was {{established}} in Taliedo, not far from Milan, by provisions of the <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> of Gianni and Timina Guasti Caproni. It was Italy's first museum to be entirely dedicated {{to the topic of}} aviation, as well as the nation's first corporate museum. The museum's original goal was to preserve the items of historical interest about the development of the Caproni aircraft manufacturing company, but its scope soon came to include every aspect of the history of human flight as well as those facets of art and other disciplines that had an aviation connection.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{mobility}} of the single compliant joints and entire compliant mechanisms. The compliance of the joints and the mobility of the compliant mechanism can be increased by variations of geometry as well as material type of the joints. Therefore the mobility of three kinds of compliant joints with different geometrical shapes (beam joints, film joints and notch <b>joints)</b> <b>will</b> be researched. The mobility of the compliant joints made of different material types (plastic <b>joints,</b> silicone <b>joints)</b> <b>will</b> be also researched. The mobility of compliant mechanisms will be analyzed by using of the Roberts-Tchebicheff mechanism which coupler point can be guided on an approximately rectilinear path...|$|R
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> is {{a single}} {{document}} executed {{by more than one}} person (typically between spouses), making which has effect in relation to each signatory's property on his or her death (unless he or she revokes (cancels) the will during his or her lifetime). [...] Although a single document, the <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> is a separate distribution of property by each executor (signatory) and will be treated as such on admission to probate. [...] Mutual wills are any two (or more) wills which are mutually binding, such that following the first death the survivor is constrained in his or her ability to dispose of his or her property by the agreement he or she made with the deceased. [...] Historically such wills had an important role in ensuring property passed to children of a marriage rather than a widow or widower's spouse on a remarriage.|$|E
2500|$|... coordinated use {{of muscles}} around the <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> {{compensate}} for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This type often occurs {{after giving birth}} to a child weighing 3000grams or more, in cases of hypermobility, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 {{is the most common}} form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.|$|E

2500|$|Alternative, {{although}} less probable, {{theories of}} the name's origin have been proposed. According to John Corbett Anderson, [...] "The earliest mention of Croydon is in the <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> of Beorhtric and Aelfswth, dated about the year 962. In this Anglo-Saxon document the name is spelt (here he uses original script) Crogdaene. Crog was, and still is, the Norse or Danish word for crooked, which is expressed in Anglo-Saxon by crumb, a totally different word. From the Danish came our crook and crooked. This term accurately describes the locality; it is a crooked or winding valley; {{in reference to the}} valley that runs in an oblique and serpentine course from Godstone to Croydon." [...] Anderson refuted a claim, originally cited by Andrew Coltee Ducarel, that the name came from the Old French for [...] "chalk hill", because the name was in use at least a century before the French language would have been commonly used following the Norman Invasion. However, there was no long-term Danish occupation (see Danelaw) in Surrey, which was part of Wessex, and Danish-derived nomenclature is also highly unlikely. More recently, David Bird has speculated that the name might derive from a personal name, Crocus: he suggests a family connection with the documented Chrocus, king of the Alemanni, who allegedly played a part in the proclamation of Constantine as emperor at York in AD 306.|$|E
2500|$|Numbers in grey are {{balanced}} moments; arrows (→/←) {{represent the}} carry-over of moment {{from one end}} to the other end of a member.* Step 1: As joint A is released, balancing moment of magnitude equal to the fixed end moment [...] develops and is carried-over from joint A to joint B.* Step 2: The unbalanced moment at joint B now is the summation of the fixed end moments , [...] and the carry-over moment from joint A. This unbalanced moment is distributed to members BA and BC in accordance with the distribution factors [...] and [...] Step 2 ends with carry-over of balanced moment [...] to joint C. Joint A is a roller support which has no rotational restraint, so moment carryover from joint B to joint A is zero.* Step 3: The unbalanced moment at joint C now is the summation of the fixed end moments , [...] and the carryover moment from joint B. As in the previous step, this unbalanced moment is distributed to each member and then carried over to joint D and back to joint B. Joint D is a fixed support and carried-over moments to this <b>joint</b> <b>will</b> not be distributed nor be carried over to joint C.* Step 4: Joint B still has balanced moment which was carried over from joint C in step 3. Joint B is released once again to induce moment distribution and to achieve equilibrium.* Steps 5 - 10: Joints are released and fixed again until every joint has unbalanced moments of size zero or neglectably small in required precision. Arithmetically summing all moments in each respective columns gives the final moment values.|$|E
