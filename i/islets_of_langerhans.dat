25|$|The {{pancreas}} is a secretory {{structure with}} an internal hormonal role (endocrine) and an external digestive role (exocrine). The endocrine part {{is composed of}} hormonal tissue distributed along the pancreas in discrete units called <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> have a well-established structure and form density routes through the exocrine tissue. The exocrine part has two main ducts, the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct. These drain enzymes through the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The tissues with an {{endocrine}} role {{can be seen}} under staining as lightly-stained {{clusters of}} cells, called pancreatic islets (also called <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans).</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{idea was}} the pancreas's {{internal}} secretion, which, it was supposed, regulates {{sugar in the}} bloodstream, might {{hold the key to}} the treatment of diabetes. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead to atrophy of most of the pancreas, while leaving the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> intact. He theorized a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once {{most of the rest of}} the pancreas was gone.|$|E
25|$|Beta {{cells in}} the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly {{triggered}} in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of type2 diabetes. First-phase release and insulin sensitivity are independent predictors of diabetes.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rising}} {{success rate of}} transplants and modern {{immunosuppression}} make transplants more common, {{the need for more}} organs has become critical. Transplants from living donors, especially relatives, have become increasingly common. Additionally, there is substantive research into xenotransplantation, or transgenic organs; although these forms of transplant are not yet being used in humans, clinical trials involving the use of specific cell types have been conducted with promising results, such as using porcine <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> to treat type1 diabetes. However, there are still many problems that would need to be solved before they would be feasible options in people requiring transplants.|$|E
40|$|Body weight {{regulation}} {{is the result}} of food intake and energy expenditure. The central nervous system (CNS), and in particular, the hypothalamus, controls food intake as well as metabolism, the latter mainly by autonomic effects on the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> hepatocytes and adipocytes. Body weight, more precisely body fat content, is probably controlled by a feedback mechanism in which insulin, released from the B cell <b>of</b> the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> plays a key role. The <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> is an intricate neuroendocrine unit in which the release of glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin from A, B, and D cells, respectively, is controlled by the CNS via a rich autonomic innervation. In addition, the endocrine cells of the pancreas influence each other by paracrine actions. The CNS control <b>of</b> the <b>islets</b> shapes the plasma insulin and blood glucose profiles during the circadian cycle and thereby regulates the nutrient flow to the different tissues in the body. Thus, the CNS structures involved in regulation of body weight and food intake control also metabolism. The mechanisms contributing to match food intake and the needs of metabolism are discussed. ...|$|R

The candidates discussed include: immunoglobulins and gamma globulins; isolated <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>langerhans</b> from pancreas; bone marrow; tumor cells; kidney cells, cryoprecipitate; and column separated cultures...|$|R
25|$|Hormones are {{the major}} {{signaling}} molecules of the endocrine system, though they often regulate each other's secretion via local signaling (e.g. <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> cells), and most are also expressed in tissues for local purposes (e.g. angiotensin) or failing that, structurally related molecules are (e.g. PTHrP).|$|R
25|$|Insulin is {{released}} into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by {{about two-thirds of the}} body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage. Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. This process is mainly controlled by the hormone glucagon, which acts in the opposite manner to insulin.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{insufficiency}} of {{the pancreas}} occurs with JBS, {{though it is}} sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function. The <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> are ducts in the pancreas where endocrine activity such as the release of hormones glucagon, somatostatin and insulin takes place. Pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in JBS {{can be associated with}} either a buildup of connective tissue in the islet regions, congenital replacement of the islets with fatty tissue, or improper nerve signalling to the islets. Endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus. Both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with JBS, and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of JBS and its course.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{a hormone}} which helps {{regulate}} glucose {{levels in the}} body. When blood glucose is high, insulin is released from the <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> Insulin, among other things, will then facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells via increased expression and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT-4. Under conditions of exercise, however, blood sugar levels are not necessarily high, and insulin is not necessarily activated, yet muscles are still able to bring in glucose. AMPK seems to be responsible in part for this exercise-induced glucose uptake. Goodyear et al. observed that with exercise, the concentration of GLUT-4 was increased in the plasma membrane, but decreased in the microsomal membranes, suggesting that exercise facilitates the translocation of vesicular GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane. While acute exercise increases GLUT-4 translocation, endurance training will increase {{the total amount of}} GLUT-4 protein available. It has been shown that both electrical contraction and AICAR treatment increase AMPK activation, glucose uptake, and GLUT-4 translocation in perfused rat hindlimb muscle, linking exercise-induced glucose uptake to AMPK. Chronic AICAR injections, simulating some of the effects of endurance training, also increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein in the muscle cell.|$|E

50|$|Pulsatile insulin {{secretion}} {{from individual}} beta cells {{is driven by}} oscillation of the calcium concentration in the cells. In beta cells lacking contact, the periodicity of these oscillations is rather variable (2-10 min). However, within an <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> the oscillations become synchronized by electrical coupling between closely located beta cells that are connected by gap junctions, and the periodicity is more uniform (3-6 min).|$|R

500|$|DKA {{is common}} in type 1 {{diabetes}} as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body's requirements {{as a result of}} end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in someone with type 2 diabetes, their condition is called [...] "ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes". The exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear, but there is evidence both of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action. Once the condition has been treated, insulin production resumes and often the person may be able to resume diet or tablet treatment as normally recommended in type 2 diabetes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1869, while {{studying}} {{the structure of}} the pancreas under a microscope, Paul Langerhans, a medical student in Berlin, identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas. The function of the [...] "little heaps of cells", later known as the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> initially remained unknown, but Edouard Laguesse later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion. Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term [...] "insulin" [...] originates from insula, the Latin word for islet/island.|$|E
25|$|When the {{glucose level}} {{comes down to}} the usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|R
40|$|Background: The rapidly {{increasing}} use of mobile phones has led to public concerns about possible health effects of these popular communication devices. This study {{is an attempt to}} investigate the effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation produced by GSM mobile phones on the insulin release in rats. Methods: Forty two female adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 were exposed to RF radiation 6 hours per day for 7 days. Group 2 received sham exposure (6 hours per day for 7 days). Groups 3 and 4 received RF radiation 3 hours per day for 7 days and sham exposure (3 hours per day), respectively. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of RF was 2. 0 W/kg. Results: Our results showed that RF radiations emitted from mobile phone could not alter insulin release in rats. However, mild to severe inflammatory changes in the portal spaces of the liver of rats as well as damage in the cells <b>of</b> <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> were observed. These changes were linked with the duration of the exposures. Conclusion: RF exposure can induce inflammatory changes in the liver as well causing damage in the cells <b>of</b> <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{histological}} analysis, disposition and histochemical localization of tryptophan {{were investigated}} in the pancreas {{to compare the}} cellular organization and histochemical characterization in the pancreas of Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822), Mystus vittatus (Bloch, 1790) and Notopterus notopterus (Pallas, 1769) having different feeding habits. Histological analysis demonstrated that the exocrine pancreatic tissues were dispersed within the hepatic parenchyma and spleen in L. rohita. Thin septa of connective tissue separated parenchyma of liver and also the spleen from exocrine pancreatic cells. However, in M. vittatus, the discrete pancreatic tissue formed distinct oval or elongated acini interspersed with small area <b>of</b> <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> and blood vessels. In N. notopterus, the rhomboidal acinar cells of discrete pancreatic tissue intercalated with comparatively clear and large <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> The exocrine acinar cells in all the three species were provided with prominent nuclei and densely packed zymogen granules. Histochemical localization revealed that the zymogen granules of exocrine acinar cells of all species exhibited varied intensities of tryptophan reaction, the precursor of various pancreatic enzymes which {{may be related to}} the food and feeding habits of the fishes under study...|$|R
2500|$|In 1889, the {{physician}} Oskar Minkowski, {{in collaboration with}} Joseph von Mering, removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing {{for the first time}} a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist Eugene Lindsay Opie, when he established the link between the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> and diabetes: [...] "Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed". Before Opie's work, medical science had clearly established the link between the pancreas and diabetes, but not the specific role of the islets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} {{contains the}} <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> which {{are responsible for}} making insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose. Damage of the pancreas can lead to loss of the islet cells, leading to a type of diabetes unique to those with the disease. This cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [...] shares characteristics {{that can be found}} in type 1 and type 2 diabetics, {{and is one of the}} principal nonpulmonary complications of CF. Vitamin D is involved in calcium and phosphate regulation. Poor uptake of vitamin D from the diet because of malabsorption can lead to the bone disease osteoporosis in which weakened bones are more susceptible to fractures. In addition, people with CF often develop clubbing of their fingers and toes due to the effects of chronic illness and low oxygen in their tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Type 1 (Juvenile onset). The {{incidence}} of juvenile Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is about 1:500 in the U.S. population, {{and is the}} result of autoimmune damage to the <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> cells in the pancreas. The level of adult onset T1D plus ambiguous T1D/T2D is unknown. It is unclear how large a role Triticeae has in T1D, which also shows strong linkage to DQ2.5 and DQ8. Childhood (male) Type 1 diabetes increases the risk for GSE and vice versa and it now appears that GSE precedes T1D in many cases and an active search for coeliac disease in early juvenile diabetes patients revealed that GF diet resulted in some improvements. A high frequency of diabetes patients have anti-transglutaminase antibodies along with increased levels of gluten specific T-cells in T1D patients. From an evolutionary point of view it is difficult to explain the high association of T1D and DQ2.5 given negatively selective nature of the disease in NW European population given the number of studies suggesting that the [...] "Super B8" [...] haplotypes has been under positive selection, and appears to be the most characteristic HLA type in NW Europeans indicating an advanced natural history of the haplotype. A T. aesitivum storage globulin, Glb-1 (locus), was identified that is similar to the hypersensitizing peanut protein Ara h 1 and other known plant hypersensitizing proteins. Antibodies to this protein correlated with levels of lymphocyte infiltration into Islet regions of the pancreas. [...] Gastrointestinal viruses may play a role.|$|E

While insulin treatment for diabetes type I could delay and reduce the incidence of diabetic complications, it is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. To restore physiologic insulin metabolism, transplantation of insulin producing cells (pancreatic Beta cells) represent the sole available therapy.

40|$|Pancreas {{transplantation}} and <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> transplantation {{are potential}} solutions to treat patients with type 1 diabetes. However, pancreas grafts are scarce {{and there is}} a shortage of donor pancreata relative to the number of patients needing a transplant. The aim of this thesis was to further optimize pancreas graft survival in pancreas transplantation and to optimize islet isolation outcomes in <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> transplantation, leading to better use of available organs. The focus in pancreas transplantation should be on optimizing recipients to improve graft survival and on improving quality of pancreata procured by centers not performing pancreas transplantation (for example, by training procurement surgeons to optimize pancreas procurement, thereby increasing the number of transplantable organs. In islets transplantation, it is recommended that the reporting of donor, pancreas and isolation factors should become more standardized, which would enable us to determine more accurately which factors are important predictors for islet isolation outcome. Furthermore, if more biomedical factors (e. g. the presence <b>of</b> hyperemic <b>islets)</b> would be reported in addition to the other factors, we would be able to assess the independent effect of these biomedical factors for islet isolation outcome and eventually the effect on islet transplantation in the clinical setting.

2500|$|TAAR1 {{peripheral}} and immune localization/functions: It {{is important}} to note that in addition to the brain, TAAR1 is also expressed in the spinal cord (Gozal et al., 2014) and periphery (Revel et al., 2012c). It has been shown that TAAR1 is expressed and regulates immune function in rhesus monkey leukocytes (Babusyte et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2007; Panas et al., 2012). In granulocytes, TAAR1 is necessary for chemotaxic migration of cells towards TAAR1 agonists. In addition, TAAR1 signaling in B and T cells can trigger immunoglobulin and cytokine release, respectively (Babusyte et al., 2013). TAAR1 is also expressed in the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> stomach and intestines based on LacZ staining patterns carried out on TAAR1-KO LacZ mice (Revel et al., 2012c). Interestingly, the administration of selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 reverses the side effect of weight gain observed with the antipsychotic olanzapine, indicating that peripheral TAAR1 signalling can regulate metabolic homeostasis (Revel et al., 2012b)....Monoamine transporters and SLC22A carrier subfamily transport TAAR1 ligand: Studies using the rhesus monkey TAAR1 have shown that this receptor interacts with the monoamine transporters DAT, SERT, and NET in HEK cells (Miller et al., 2005; Xie and Miller, 2007; Xie et al., 2007). It has been hypothesized that TAAR1 interaction with these transporters might provide a mechanism by which TAAR1 ligands can enter the cytoplasm and bind to TAAR1 in intracellular compartments. A recent study has shown that in rat neonatal motor neurons, trace-amine specific signalling requires the presence and function of the transmembrane solute carrier SLC22A but not that of monoamine transporters (DAT, SERT, and NET) (Gozal et al., 2014). Specifically, it was shown that addition of β-PEA, tyramine, or tryptamine induced locomotor like activity (LLA) firing patterns of these neurons in the presence of N-Methyl D-Aspartate. Temporally, it was found that the trace amine induction of LLA is delayed compared to serotonin and norepinephrine induced LLA, indicating the target site for the trace amines is not located on the plasma membrane and could perhaps be intracellular. Importantly, blocking of SLC22A with pentamidine abolished trace amine induced LLA, indicating that trace amine induced LLA does not act on receptors found on the plasma membrane but requires their transport to the cytosol by SLC22A for induction of LLA.}} ...|$|E

40|$|Glutamate is {{the major}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and may induce cytotoxicity through persistent activation of glutamate receptors and oxidative stress. Its extracellular concentration is maintained at physiological concentrations by high affinity glutamate transporters of the solute carrier 1 family (SLC 1). Glutamate is also present in <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> where it is secreted by the α-cells and acts as a signaling molecule to modulate hormone secretion. Whether glutamate plays a role in islet cell viability is presently unknown. We demonstrate that chronic exposure to glutamate exerts a cytotoxic effect in clonal β-cell lines and human islet β-cells but not in α-cells. In human islets, glutamate-induced β-cell cytotoxicity was associated with increased oxidative stress and led to apoptosis and autophagy. We also provide evidence that the key regulator <b>of</b> extracellular <b>islet</b> glutamate concentration is the glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT 1). GLT 1 localizes to the plasma membrane of β-cells, modulates hormone secretion, and prevents glutamate-induced cytotoxicity as shown by the fact that its down-regulation induced β-cell death, whereas GLT 1 up-regulation promoted β-cell survival. In conclusion, the present study identifies GLT 1 as a new player in glutamate homeostasis and signaling in the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> and demonstrates that β-cells critically depend on its activity to control extracellular glutamate levels and cellular integrity...|$|R
