40|$|Introduction: A new noise-reduced landing {{approach}} was tested – a Segmented Continuous Descent Approach (SCDA) - {{with regard to}} the resulting workload on pilots. Methods: Workload of 40 pilots was measured using physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blink frequency, saliva cortisol concentration) and psychological (fatigue, sleepiness, tension and task load) parameters. Approaches were conducted in A 320 and A 330 <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulators</b> during night shift. SCDA was compared to the standard Low Drag Low Power (LDLP) procedure as reference. Results: Mean heart rate and blood pressure during the SCDA were not elevated, partly even significantly reduced (on average by 5 bpm and 4 mmHg regarding the flying Captain). Cortisol levels did not change significantly with mean values of 0. 9 to 1. 2 ng/ml. Landing was the most demanding segment of both approaches as indicated by significant increases in heart rate and decreases in blink frequency. Subjective task load was low. Discussion: Both approach procedures caused a similar workload level. Interpreting the results, methodological limitations have to be considered, e. g. the artificial and controlled airspace situation in the flight simulator. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that under these ideal conditions, the SCDA is operable without a higher workload for pilots compared to the common LDLP. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnstabilized {{approach}} has been identified {{to be a major}} causal factor of approach-and-landing accidents (e. g. off-runway touchdowns, hard landing, tail-strikes, etc). We conducted an experiment in order to analyze pilots’ performance during such approaches. Ten type-rated, commercial pilots flew each in a B 737 <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> during an unstabilized approach at Hamburg airport. The Pilot Flyings’ (PF) eye gazes were collected. The results revealed that half of the pilots persisted in an erroneous landing decision. These latter pilots had higher dwell time on the attitude indicator/flight director whereas the group of pilots who perfomed the go-around exhibited more fixations on the navigation display prior to their final decision. These findings indicate that the decision whether to land or to go-around is taken considerably long before the respective task is executed, and that the use of heuristics impair pilot’s performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of different methods to assess reliability when instructor pilots rate pilots regarding their non-technical skills (NOTECHS). In preparation for a major inter-rater reliability study, this pretest analyzes the rating behavior of two instructor pilots during a <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> mission. Besides inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability, the pilots’ self-rating (n = 12) and the instructors’ point of view is analyzed. Results indicate a wide spread from poor to excellent reliabilities {{as a function of the}} different rating dimensions. Regarding inter-rater reliability, it is found that non-technical skills are rated more reliably under high workload conditions than under low workload conditions, and social aspects of non-technical skills are rated more reliably than cognitive aspects. Test-retest reliability is found to be. 6 on average, whereas self-rating / instructor rating reliability is. 5 on average.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse pilots' decision-making behaviour in terms of naturalistic decision-making. In line with the highly experienced group of pilots (n = 120), recognition-primed decisions are expected to dominate. In a <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> experiment, with two groups of pilots (short-haul and long-haul pilots) with different levels of practice and training, we were able to show that only about one-third of the pilots make recognition-primed decisions. Results may indicate that the current training practice helps pilots to handle foreseeable problems very well, yet does not support pilots in ambivalent and new decision-making situations. Based on these findings, we recommend the incorporation of more unforeseen events in recurrent training simulator missions to train pilots in handling unknown situations. Practitioner Summary: The results from a flight-simulator study showed that pilots' decision-making is more analytical than recognition-primed. A possible reason for this could be the pressure for justification, or simply that pilots cannot use their experience in unforeseen situations. Hence, training should include more unforeseen events...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft noise threatens {{air traffic}} growth, since {{residents}} are annoyed or suffer from impairments due to increasing aircraft movements. Low-noise approaches become {{of particular interest}} as short- or medium-term countermeasures. However, aircrew performance during such approaches may change, as may their acceptance, and flight safety may be mitigated compared to standard approaches. Therefore, a segmented continuous descent approach (SCDA) was compared to a standard low drag low power approach (LDLP). 40 pilots were tested on an either A 320 or A 330 <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> during one LDLP and 3 SCDAs. Due to switching tasks between flying and non-flying pilots, each pilot conducted 8 approaches. Technical, physiological and psychological data were monitored using EEG, EOG, ECG, saliva cortisol, and questionnaires (fatigue, taskload, acceptance). Under the conditions investigated, only small deviations from the planned flight paths were observed, indicating good performance. SCDA was rated rather non-problematic, and workload was acceptable. Taskload, fatigue, cortisol and ECG did not differ between the procedures. However, pilots rated SCDA as being less safe than LDLP. The simulator tests have been a first attempt to investigate noise reduced approaches under high fidelity conditions. Before discussing to introduce them into practice, further studies are strongly recommended, e. g. under real flight conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Examination of the {{performance}} and visual scanning of aircrews during final approach and an unexpected go-around maneuver. Background: Accident and incident analyses have revealed that go-around procedures are often imperfectly performed because of their complexity, their high time stress, and their rarity of occurrence that avails little time for practice. We wished to examine this experimentally and establish the frequency and nature of errors in both flight-performance and visual scanning. Method: We collected flight-performance (e. g., errors in procedures, excessive flight deviations) and eye-tracking data of 12 flight crews who performed final approach and go-around flight phases in realistic <b>full-flight</b> transport-category <b>simulators.</b> Results: The pilot performance results showed that {{two thirds of the}} crews committed errors including critical trajectory deviations during go-arounds, a precursor of accidents. Eye-tracking analyses revealed that the cross-checking process was not always efficient in detecting flight-path deviations when they occurred. Ocular data also highlighted different visual strategies between the 2 crew members during the 2 flight phases. Conclusion: This study reveals that the go-around is a challenging maneuver. It demonstrates the advantages of eye tracking and suggests that it is a valuable tool for the explicit training of attention allocation during go-arounds to enhance flight safety...|$|R
40|$|The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was {{developed}} as an analytical {{framework for the}} investigation of the role of human error in aviation accidents. Five hundred and twenty-three accidents in the Republic of China (R. O. C.) Air Force between 1978 and 2002 were analysed using this framework. The results showed that in a great many cases, poor pilot decision-making was implicated. Following a survey of flight instructors’ opinions, two of most promising mnemonic-based methods currently available to guide the decision-making of pilots were identified (SHOR and DESIDE). These methods were developed into a short (four hour) Aeronautical Decision Making Training course. Forty-one pilots from the Republic of China Tactical Training Wing then participated in a study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this training course. Half of the participants received the short ADM training programme and half did not. Their decision-making skill was evaluated in a series of emergency situations presented in a <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator.</b> Furthermore, their decision-making processes were examined in a series of pencil-and-paper based tests.

40|$|International audienceDespite growing {{interest}} over the decades, {{the question of}} estimating cognitive workload of operators involved in complex multitask operations, such as helicopter pilots, remains a key issue. One of the main difficulties facing workload inference models is that no single specific indicator of workload exists, so that multiple sources of information have to be inputted to the model. The question then arises as to the nature and the quantity of features {{to be used for}} increasing model performance. In this research, done in cooperation with Eurocopter, the effectiveness of physiological, psychological, and cognitive features for estimating helicopter pilots' workload was systematically investigated, using Bayesian networks (BNs). The study took place in two different contexts: a constrained laboratory situation with low ecological validity and a more realistic and challenging situation relying on virtual reality. The constrained conditions of the laboratory study allowed us for testing various combinations of entropy-based physiological, cognitive, and affect features as inputs of BN models. These three different kinds of features are shown to carry complementary information that can be used with advantage by the model. The results also suggest that increasing the number of physiological inputs improves the model performance. The second study aimed at challenging some of these conclusions in a more ecological context, by using the NH 90 <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> of the Helisim company. The results emphasize the problem of accessing the ground truth, as well as the need for an efficient feature selection or extraction step prior to the classification step...|$|E
40|$|A flight {{simulator}} {{study has been}} carried out to evaluate the performance of modern flight control systems encountering curved wake vortices. During the decay process the shape of wake vortices alters significantly which has an influence on the encounter characteristics and thus on the encounter hazard. To analyse most realistic wake encounters, flow fields of matured vortices have been generated with large-eddy-simulations. These were used for the determination of induced force and moment histories during the encounter. The force and moment histories have been implemented into the equations of motions of a 6 DoF flight simulation. For the sake of comparison encounters have also been simulated with straight vortices as they were mostly used for many other investigations. The most important goal {{of the study was to}} analyse the difference between these ideally straight vortices and vortices with a more realistic shape regarding encounter acceptance. The simulator study was conducted in an A 330 motion-based <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator</b> with pilots-in-the-loop. The analysed scenario was a wake encounter during final approach. The encounter conditions corresponded to a heavy-behind-heavy situation for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations. The aircraft was flown either manually (in normal law) or with autopilot engaged. Altogether 93 encounters have been simulated, 38 with straight and 55 encounters with curved vortices. For encounters under manual control the simulator study revealed a potential risk of pilot induced oscillations (PIO) during encounters with curved vortices. With autopilot engaged not even one encounter with curved vortices was classified to be unacceptable. Although significant aircraft response was experienced the autopilot never disengaged automatically in any encounter. Altogether about 12 percent of the encounters were not accepted by the pilots. This is indeed a significant number, especially as the analysed scenarios can be regarded to be realistic situations which can occur in reality even if the applicable separation distances are applied. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} RNP AR approach procedures {{which have}} been designed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Flight Guidance {{in the course of}} the LufoIV project HETEREX. The approaches purpose is to reduce the noise impact of approaching aircraft at an airport. Approaches with vertical guidance need a straight segment of about 10 NM prior to touchdown due to technical and operational, i. e. safety reasons. In case settlements are located on the extended centreline nearer than 10 NM to the airport, these settlements can not be circumnavigated. With GPS and vertical navigation based on the barometric system, approaches with vertical guidance do not need a straight segment of 10 NM prior to touchdown anymore. Those approaches have first been developed and certified for mountainous regions, where straight segments of up to 10 NM were impossible due to the terrain around the airport. Operations to these airports were limited to good weather situations only. With the precision of GPS in conjunction with a barometric vertical navigation system (BARO VNAV), those airports can now be operated to in much more inclement weather situations regarding visibility and cloud bases. In 2010, ICAO released a certification guideline for those approaches with curved segments nearer than 10 NM to the airport, called RNP AR for Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required. In Germany, no airports with the need for RNP AR approaches due to mountainous terrain exist. Nevertheless, RNP AR approaches with their possibility of curved segments nearer than 10 NM prior to touchdown provide the possibility to design approaches which avoid settlements that lie under the extended centreline of a runway and are nearer than 10 NM to an airport. In this paper, five approaches to the airport of Nuremberg are presented which lead approaching aircraft around several towns near Nuremberg which with the currently applied approach procedures can not be circumnavigated and thus are impacted by the noise of arrival traffic. These approaches show how RNP AR can be used to improve airports’ acceptance by surrounding communities. The five example approaches at Nuremberg are presented together with the design rules that determine their exact shape as well as the population areas that can be circumnavigated with these approaches. Their potential to further reduce fuel consumption and thus production of CO 2 by shortening the length of approach procedures is also presented. The approaches have undergone a first flyability assessment in a <b>full-flight</b> <b>simulator...</b>|$|E
