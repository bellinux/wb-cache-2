5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International <b>has</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E

5000|$|What {{about the}} {{original}} understanding? The debates contain scattered {{statements about the}} permanence or impermanence of the Union. The occasional reference to the impermanency of the Constitution are hard to interpret. They might <b>have</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> a legal right to revoke ratification. But they equally could <b>have</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> an extraconstitutional right of revolution, or {{to the possibility that}} a new national convention would rewrite the Constitution, or simply to the factual possibility that the national government might break down. Similarly, references to the permanency of the Union could <b>have</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the practical unlikelihood of withdrawal rather than any lack of legal power. The public debates seemingly do not speak specifically to whether ratification under Article VII was revocable.|$|R
