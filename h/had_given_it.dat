5|$|The {{length of}} time that Detox had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{obtained}} {{one more}} benefice during this period. On 20 December 1348, {{he was made}} Dean of Aberdeen Cathedral, a high-ranking office which Walter was not technically eligible to hold without a papal grace, being only a sub-deacon in orders. The deanery had been made vacant {{by the death of}} the long-serving Gilbert Fleming. Although in July the Pope <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> as an extra prebend for Annibald de Ceccano, Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum, this had been cancelled by 20 December, when it was given to Walter instead.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person farming {{community}} of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph – the son of an alcoholic who had immigrated from Ireland – had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> up due to his teammates' heavy drinking, gambling and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George's mother was the former Frances McLean, born c. 1890 and initially raised in Ontario; her family had later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota looking for work as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern's salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form of potatoes, cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.|$|E
5|$|Stage 15 {{proved to}} be a crucial one, as the Tour entered Switzerland in a stage with many high {{mountain}} climbs. With about three kilometers gone by in an 8.8km final climb to Verbier, Contador attacked and got free of the leading group, that included Klöden and Armstrong, soloing to the line for the stage win and the yellow jersey. Armstrong said after the stage that he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> everything he had in the climb and Contador was simply the stronger rider; it was seen as settling any lingering controversy over the squad's leader and protected rider. Contador all but cemented the Tour title by winning the time trial in Annecy in Stage 18, just beating out Cancellara to post the day's best time. Armstrong gained a little over a minute on Fränk Schleck by finishing 16th, and climbed back into a podium position, third, with the result. The two finished the Tour in those positions after holding them on Mont Ventoux, and then riding home safely in the Tour's largely ceremonial finale in Stage 21.|$|E
5|$|In 1320 King Edward II of England confiscated the lordship of Gower on {{the grounds}} that Braose <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> to his {{son-in-law}} Mowbray without royal permission. Over the preceding years Braose had promised Gower to a number of persons, including Humphrey de Bohun, the Earl of Hereford, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. Mowbray then in late 1319 took custody of Gower to protect his rights. Despenser persuaded the king in 1320 to take Gower into royal hands in October, and was appointed keeper of the honour in November. The other lords in the Welsh Marches resented this seizure, feeling that the king's excuse for it was not applicable. The seizure was one of the precipitating causes of the baronial rebellion that led to the exile of the Despensers in 1321. In 1322 Gower was given to the younger Despenser again, who then traded it for the honours of Usk and Caerleon. Braose was then induced to sue the new holder of Gower for the return of the barony in April 1324, which action succeeded in June 1324. Braose then promptly gave Gower to the elder Despenser, returning the property to the Despenser family once more. The lordship of Gower eventually ended {{up in the hands of}} the Beauchamp family, but it was not until the 1350s that the issue was decided.|$|E

By the early 1970s, however, increasing suburbanization and the growth of the automobile <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> its first serious competition, {{in the form of the}} South Hills Mall.

This <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> access to Heathrow, Hunting's old base, for {{a limited number of}} all-cargo services to Africa. Moreover, BUA acted as Sudan Airways's technical advisers and operated that airline's Blue Nile Viscount services between Khartoum and London Gatwick.|$|E

The aircraft was parked close to the terminal building, but was asked to move briefly as a security measure upon the arrival of a flight carrying President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda.|$|E

After their joint suicide in 30 BC, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod {{absolute}} rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written Alayiq). In 2008 the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{also said}} that while she was working at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney during World War II, she had owned {{a copy of the}} Rubaiyat. In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> to an army {{lieutenant}} named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the Water Transport Section of the Royal Australian Engineers. Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to Melbourne and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married. (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, {{was in the process of}} obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950.) There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.|$|E

A {{detachment}} from the 3rd Bombay Regiment was sent to overcome the Afghan troopers who were bodyguards of Rani Laxmibai and although the Afghans inflicted significant casualties on the Regiment, they were eventually all disposed of and the standard of the Rani was retrieved. An English union flag of silk was also retrieved. Lord William Bentinck <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>it</b> to the grandfather of the husband of the Rani, with the permission to have it carried before him, {{as a reward for}} his fidelity-a privilege granted to no other Indian prince. The soldiers were allowed to hoist the flag on the place. The fighting in the city continued for a further day culminating in Lieutenant Baigrie of the 3rd Bombay European Regiment announcing that he had entered an abandoned fort, and so the fall of Jhansi was claimed. Described as a significant tactical victory, the toll on the Regiment was 7 killed in action and 52 wounded.|$|E
