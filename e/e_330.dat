The gene encoding PGI in Sphingomonas chungbukensis DJ 77 was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the protein was characterized. The pgi gene from DJ 77 is 1, 503 nucleotides long with 62 % GC content and the deduced amino acid sequence shows strong homol-ogy with PGIs from other sources. The molecular masses of PGI subunit and native form were estimated to be 50 kDa and 97 kDa, respectively. Four potentially important residues (H 361, R 245, <b>E</b> <b>330</b> and K 472) were identified by homology modeling. The mutations, H 361 A, R 245 A, <b>E</b> <b>330</b> A, R 245 K and <b>E</b> <b>330</b> D resulted in decrease in Vmax by hundreds fold, how-ever no significant change in Km was observed.

The Panel noted that if the active substances are used not in direct contact with food, but are placed in a pad under conditions where its absorption capacity is not exceeded, then no migration is to be expected and therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected.

40|$|Abstract—The {{realization}} of slow light with ultra-flat dispersion in hybrid photonic crystal (HPhC) waveguide is systematically investigated.

40|$|The calcium {{bridge between}} the pentamers of polyoma viruses {{maintains}} capsid metastability. It {{has been shown that}} viral infection is profoundly inhibited by the substitution of lysine for glutamate in one calcium-binding residue of the SV 40 capsid protein, VP 1. However, it is unclear how the calcium bridge affects SV 40 infectivity. In this in vitro study, we analyzed the influence of host cell components on SV 40 capsid stability. We used an SV 40 mutant capsid (<b>E</b> <b>330</b> K) in which lysine had been substituted for glutamate 330 in protein VP 1. The mutant capsid retained the ability to interact with the SV 40 cellular receptor GM 1, and the internalized mutant capsid accumulated in caveolin- 1 -mediated endocytic vesicles and was then translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) region. However, when placed in ER-rich microsome, the mutant capsid retained its spherical structure in contrast to the wild type, which disassembled. Structural analysis of the mutant capsid with cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction revealed altered pentamer coordination, possibly as a result of electrostatic interaction, although its overall structure resembled that of the wild type. These results indicate that the calcium ion serves as a trigger at the pentamer interface, which switches on capsid disassembly, and that the failure of the <b>E</b> <b>330</b> K mutant capsid to disassemble is attributable to an inadequate triggering system. Our data also indicate that calcium depletion-induced SV 40 capsid disassembly may occur in the ER region and that this is essential for successful SV 40 infection...|$|E

We have also shown that amino acid region 332 - 336 contains residues that are important for cofactor function. Using overlapping peptides, we identified amino acids D 334 and Y 335 as contributors to cofactor activity. We constructed recombinant factor V molecules with the mutations D 334 f K and Y 335 f F (factor VKF) and D 334 f A and Y 335 f A (factor VAA). Kinetic studies showed that while factor VaKF and factor VaAA had a KD for factor Xa similar to the KD observed for wild-type factor Va (factor VaWT), the clotting activities of the mutant molecules were impaired and the kcat of prothrombinase assembled with factor VaKF and factor VaAA was reduced. The second-order rate constant of prothrombinase assembled with factor VaKF or factor VaAA for prothrombin activation was ∼ 10 -fold lower than the second-order rate constant for the same reaction catalyzed by prothrombinase assembled with factor VaWT. We also created quadruple mutants combining mutations in the amino acid region 334 – 335 with mutations at the previously identified amino acids that are important for factor Xa binding (i. e., E 323 Y 324 and <b>E</b> <b>330</b> V 331).

40|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed or mutated in glioma. Recently, a series of missense mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR were reported in glioma patients. Some of these mutations clustered within a cysteine-rich region of the EGFR targeted by the therapeutic antibody mAb 806. This region is only exposed when EGFR activates and appears to locally misfold during activation. We expressed two of these mutations (R 324 L and <b>E</b> <b>330</b> K) in NR 6 mouse fibroblasts, as they do not express any EGFR-related receptors. Both mutants were autophosphorylated {{in the absence of}} ligand and enhanced cell survival and anchorage-independent and xenograft growth. The ECD truncation that produces the de 2 - 7 EGFR (or EGFRvIII), the most common EGFR mutation in glioma, generates a free cysteine in this same region. Using a technique optimized for detecting disulfide-bonded dimers, we definitively demonstrated that the de 2 - 7 EGFR is robustly dimerized and that ablation of the free cysteine prevents dimerization and activation. Modeling of the R 324 L mutation suggests it may cause transient breaking of disulfide bonds, leading to similar disulfide-bonded dimers as seen for the de 2 - 7 EGFR. These ECD mutations confirm that the cysteine-rich region of EGFR around the mAb 806 epitope has a significant role in receptor activation...|$|E

With respect to field area, the experiment consisted of two sites: NyeÅlesund (78 � 550 N, 11 � 560 E) and Longyearbyen (78 � 130 N, 15 � <b>330</b> <b>E)</b> with further integration of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station in Hornsund (77 � 000 N, 15 � <b>330</b> <b>E).</b> The subject {{of this study is to}} investigate the inesitu, passive and active remote sensing observations as well as numerical simulations to describe the temporal variability of aerosol singleescattering properties during spring season on Spitsbergen. The retrieval of the data indicates several event days with enhanced singleescattering properties due to the existence of sulphate and additional seaesalt load in the atmosphere which is possibly caused by relatively high wind speed. Optical results were confirmed by numerical simulations made by the GEMeAQ model and by chemical observations that indicated up to 45...|$|R
