500|$|Paul had {{received}} little media attention {{during the early}} stages of the Democratic and Republican primary contests. But as Vice President George H.W. Bush and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis secured their respective parties' nominations, mentions of Paul increased. It was noted that <b>if</b> <b>Bush</b> became unacceptable to conservatives, they would not turn to Dukakis, but would most likely vote for Paul as a protest. During this time, publications also started discussed Paul's tax policy. It called for a flat income tax rate of 10% on all earnings over $10,000 annually. Paul sold his tax plan while campaigning in Utah. In front of 250 people in Kane County, he hailed California's 1978 passage of Proposition 13 as starting the [...] "tax revolt and [...] a message across the country. The next big message for this country should be the overwhelming passage of the tax initiatives... in November." [...] Paul was also part of C-SPAN's program Road to the White House, which followed different candidates on the campaign trail. In June, they aired Paul's address to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.|$|E

500|$|On March 24, 2005, Judge Greer {{denied a}} {{petition}} for intervention by the Department of Children & Families (DCF) and signed an order forbidding the department from [...] "taking possession of Theresa Marie Schiavo or removing her" [...] from the hospice and directed [...] "each and every and singular sheriff {{of the state}} of Florida" [...] to enforce his order. The order was appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals the following day, which resulted in an automatic stay under state law. While the stay was in effect, Florida Department of Law Enforcement personnel prepared to take custody of Terri and transfer her to a local hospital for reinsertion of the feeding tube. Once Greer was made aware of the stay, he ordered it lifted and all parties stood down. Governor Bush decided to obey the court order despite enormous pressure from the political right. <b>If</b> <b>Bush</b> (or the Florida Legislature) had ignored Greer's order by attempting to remove her from the hospice, a confrontation between the Pinellas Park Police Department and the FDLE agents could have ensued. In jest, one official said local police discussed [...] "...whether we had enough officers to hold off the National Guard." ...|$|E

A voter in a [...] "punch-card" [...] county has a greater chance of having his vote undercounted than a voter in an [...] "optical scanner" [...] county. <b>If</b> <b>Bush</b> wins, Gore argued, every state {{would have to have}} one statewide method of recording votes to be constitutional.|$|E

There was similar legislation in Westland. It gave up to 75 acre, with settlers just paying {{the cost of a}} survey.
