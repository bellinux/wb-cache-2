5|$|During the 1830s and 1840s, other faith <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> came to St. Louis, {{including}} the first Jewish congregation in the area, the United Hebrew Congregation, which was organized in 1837. Followers of Mormonism arrived in 1831, and in 1854, they organized the first LDS church in St. Louis. Despite these events, during the pre-Civil War era most of the population were culturally Catholic or uninterested in organized religion.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the referendum, aboriginal peoples in Quebec strongly affirmed their own right to self-determination. First Nations chiefs said that forcing their peoples to join an independent Quebec without their consent would violate international law, violating their rights to self-determination.

5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most black voters in the South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male voters were exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other <b>groups,</b> <b>also</b> fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus {{of all of these}} groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the fall of Nojpetén, there are {{estimated}} to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> played their part.|$|E

In Cebu, guerrillas and irregulars under Lieutenant James M. Cushing and Basilio J. Valdes aided in the Battle for Cebu City. They were also {{successful}} in their capture of Maj. Gen. Takeo Manjom and his 2,000 soldiers and munitions. Panay guerrillas under Col. Macario Peralta helped in the seizing of the Tiring Landing Field and Mandurriao district airfield during the Battle of the Visayas. Major Ingeniero commanded the guerrilla forces in Bohol, {{in which they were}} credited in the liberation of the island from Japanese outposts at a cost of only seven men.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, calypso and Trinidadian steelpan became the most popular styles of music on Dominica, replacing traditional Carnival music like chanté mas and lapo kabwit. Early recording stars from this era included Swinging Busters, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem and Los Caballeros, while chorale <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> gained fans, especially Lajenne Etwal, Siflé Montan'y and the Dominica Folk singers.

5|$|His government's {{treatment}} of non-Arab Libyans has also {{came in for}} criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. Human rights <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> criticized the {{treatment of}} migrants, including asylum seekers, who passed through Gaddafi's Libya {{on their way to}} Europe. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, {{the local}} variety of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, are widely spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with impeccable grammar. The respective ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> speak their own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E
5|$|String {{and wind}} {{instruments}} {{play an important}} role in Barbadian folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> use an electric and bass guitar. The shukster is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between two sides of a house. Traditional Barbadian wind instruments are largely metal, but in their folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. Barbadian villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and trombone.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Civil War (1917–21) {{began after}} the {{provisional}} government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in Russia in October 1917. The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army {{and the forces}} of the White Army, being a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war a number of foreign armies also took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army—including the Western allies—whilst many foreign volunteers also fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional political <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg. Despite some pressure from Britain, the Australian Prime Minister, William Hughes, had refused to commit forces to Russia following the end of World War I in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Sierra Club and the San Diego National Audubon Society, {{as well as}} {{some other}} groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the {{construction}} of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor and the federal government in March 2003. The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|When Abaoji {{conquered the}} Balhae state in 926, {{most of the}} {{population}} was relocated to what is now Liaoning, China. At least three groups remained in the former Balhae territory, one of which formed the state of Ding'an. Despite launching two invasions, in 975 and 985, the Liao forces were unable to defeat the Ding'an. Unable to eliminate the threat, and weary of Jurchen <b>groups</b> <b>also</b> inhabiting the region, the Liao established three forts with military colonies in the Yalu River valley area.|$|E
