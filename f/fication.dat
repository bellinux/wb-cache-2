40|$|International audienceModels are {{the core}} assets in Model-Driven Engineering, and are {{therefore}} subject to all kind of manipulations, like refactorings, animations, transformations into other languages, comparisons and merging. This set of model-related activities is known as model management. Even though many languages and approaches have been proposed for model management, {{most of them are}} type-centric, speci fic to concrete metamodels, and hence leading to speci <b>fications</b> with a low level of abstraction and difficult to be reused in practice. In this paper, we introduce ideas from generic programming into model management in order to raise the level of abstraction of the specifi cations of model manipulations and facilitate their reuse. In particular we adopt generic meta-model concepts as an intermediate, abstract meta-model over which model management speci <b>fications</b> are defi ned. Such meta-model concepts are mapped to concrete meta-models, so that speci <b>fications</b> can be applied to families of meta-models satisfying the concept requirements. As a proof of concept, we show the implementation of these ideas using the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Epsilon family of languages for model management...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{software}} dependability, the software veri- <b>fication</b> process has an important role. Formal verification of programs is an activity that can be inserted in this process to improve software reliability. This paper presents the defini- tion of an approach that employs a formal verification tech- nique based on abstract interpretation. The main goal is to apply this technique as a formal activity in the software veri- <b>fication</b> process to help software engineers identify programs faults. The applicability of the proposed approach is demon- strated by a case study based on embedded aerospace control software. The results obtained from its use show that abstract interpretation can contribute to software dependability. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} one of {{the areas}} where automatic simpli <b>fication</b> can be used: simpli cation of texts for machine translation. We start by comparing methods of automatic simpli cation and controlled language, describing their similarities and di erences. Further on we focus only on automatic simpli cation used as a preprocessing step for machine translation. We describe what issues can be solved and address some of them using our own system ASOFT. A text preprocessed by ASOFT is intended to be translated by a machine translation system PC Translator. We evaluate the output of the PC Translator using two automatic methods, BLEU and NIST scores, and one method of human evaluation. In the end we propose other issues that can be addressed by means of automatic simpli <b>fication...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{deductive}} program veri cation, both the speci <b>fication</b> and the code evolve as the veri <b>fication</b> process carries on. For instance, a loop invariant gets strengthened when additional properties {{are added to the}} specifi cation. This causes all the related proof obligations to change; thus previous user verifi cations become invalid.

In this paper, we describe a technique to maintain a proof session against modifi cation of verifi cation conditions. This technique is implemented in the Why 3 platform. It was successfully used in developing more than a hundred verifi ed programs and in keeping them up to date along the evolution of Why 3 and its standard library.
