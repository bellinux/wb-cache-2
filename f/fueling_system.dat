500|$|The {{high-pressure}} compressor (HPC), {{that was}} at the center of the original export controversy, features nine stages in all variants of the CFM56. The compressor stages have been developed from GE's [...] "GE1/9 core" [...] (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the accessory units in the system (bearings, oiling systems) could be merged to the main <b>fueling</b> <b>system</b> running on aviation fuel. As design evolved HPC design improved through better airfoil design. As part of the Tech-56 improvement program CFMI has tested the new CFM-56 model with six-stage high-pressure compressor stages (discs that make up the compressor system) that was designed to deliver same pressure ratios (pressure gain 30) similar to the old nine-stages compressor design.

40|$|Two {{new methods}} for the {{simulation}} of gas turbine <b>fuel</b> <b>systems,</b> {{one based on}} an inter-component volume (ICV) method, and the other based on the iterative Newton Raphson (NR) method, have been developed in this study. They are able to simulate the performance behaviour {{of each of the}} hydraulic components such as pumps, valves, metering unit of a <b>fuel</b> <b>system,</b> using physics-based models, which potentially offer more accurate results compared with those using transfer functions. A transient performance simulation system has been set up for gas turbine engines based on an inter-component volume (ICV). A proportional- integral (PI) control strategy is used for the simulation of engine control systems. An integrated engine and its control and hydraulic <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> has been set up to investigate their coupling effect during engine transient processes. The developed simulation methods and the systems have been applied to a model turbojet and a model turboshaft gas turbine engine to demonstrate the effectiveness of both two methods. The comparison between the results of engines with and without the ICV method simulated <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> models shows that the delay of the engine transient response due to the inclusion of the <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> components and introduced inter-component volumes is noticeable, although relatively small. The comparison of two developed methods applied to engine <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> simulation demonstrate that both methods introduce delay effect to the engine transient response but the NR method is ahead than the ICV method due to the omission of inter-component volumes on engine <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> simulation. The developed simulation methods are generic and {{can be applied to the}} performance simulation of any other gas turbines and their control and <b>fuel</b> <b>systems.</b> A sensitivity analysis of <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> key parameters that may affect the engine transient behaviours has also been achieved and represented in this thesis.

This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions.
