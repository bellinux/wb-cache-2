In vitro studies demonstrated complete inhibition of sporangia germination and mycelial growth following applications of Eucalyptus globus essential oil at a concentration of 0.625 mg/mL and inhibition of zoospore germination at a concentration of 0.156 mg/mL.

On December 20, 2012, an FDA Advisory Committee voted in favor of rintatolimod's safety for commercial use (vote 8 to 5), but not in favor of its efficacy (4 to 9). The Complete Response Letter asked for more study data prior to rintatolimod approval.Recently, on January 12, 2015, the company released new in vitro study findings showing that low natural killer cell function associates with greater CFS <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and that rintatolimod treatment increases average NK cell activity over 100%. The new study report, [...] "Low Natural Killer (NK) Activity Observed Across the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Disease Spectrum," [...] has been submitted as a scientific paper for peer-review and publication. In addition to the new study findings, the paper summarizes 6 supportive publications of results with more than 150 CFS patients, correlating increased debility of CFS and low NK cell activity. Clinical testing is currently under way to determine whether NK cell activity augmentation by rintatolimod in vivo associates with lessened CFS disease severity and increased physical endurance and performance measures.|$|E
5000|$|An index* is a {{sign that}} denotes its object by virtue of an actual {{connection}} involving them, one that he also calls a real relation in virtue of its being irrespective of interpretation. It is in any case a relation which is in fact, in contrast to the icon, which has only a ground for denotation of its object, and in contrast to the symbol, which denotes by an interpretive habit or law. An index which compels attention without conveying any information about its object is a pure index, though that may be an ideal limit never actually reached. If an indexical relation is a resistance or reaction physically or causally connecting an index to its object, then the index is a reagent (for example smoke coming from a building is a reagent index of fire). Such an index is really affected or modified by the object, and is the only kind of index which can be used in order to ascertain facts about its object. Peirce also usually held that an index {{does not have to be}} an actual individual fact or thing, but can be a general; a <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> is general, its occurrence singular; and he usually considered a designation to be an index, e.g., a pronoun, a proper name, a label on a diagram, etc. (In 1903 Peirce said that only an individual is an index, gave [...] "seme" [...] as an alternate expression for [...] "index", and called designations [...] "subindices or hyposemes, which were a kind of symbol; he allowed of a [...] "degenerate index" [...] indicating a non-individual object, as exemplified by an individual thing indicating its own characteristics.

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 (Pst DC 3000), {{that causes}} {{bacterial}} speck disease on tomato, produces a non-host-specific virulence effector, coronatine (COR). COR {{functions as a}} jasmonic acid (JA) -isoleucine mimic in planta and has multiple roles in the pathogenicity of Pst DC 3000. One {{of the hallmarks of}} bacterial speck disease on tomato is the formation of necrotic lesions surrounded by chlorosis and COR is required for disease development. However, the molecular basis of COR-mediated <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> development including chlorosis and necrosis is still largely unknown. In our recent publication in New Phytologist, using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) based reverse genetics screen, we demonstrated that SGT 1 (suppressor of G 2 allele of skp 1) is required for COR-induced chlorosis in Nicotiana benthamiana. SGT 1 -silenced tomato leaves showed a complete loss of COR-induced chlorosis and reduced <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> development after the inoculation with Pst DC 3000. Furthermore, Arabidopsis sgt 1 b mutant was less sensitive to COR-induced root growth inhibition and showed delayed Pst DC 3000 disease symptoms.

40|$|Phytohormones {{regulate}} plant {{responses to}} a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. How a limited number of hormones differentially mediate individual stress responses is not understood. We have used one such response, the compatible interaction of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (Xcv), to examine the interactions of jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene, and salicylic acid (SA). The role of JA was assessed using an antisense allene oxide cyclase transgenic line and the def 1 mutant to suppress Xcv-induced biosynthesis of jasmonates. Xcv growth was limited in these lines as was subsequent <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> development. No increase in JA was detected before the onset of terminal necrosis. The lack of a detectable increase in JA may indicate that an oxylipin other than JA regulates basal resistance and symptom proliferation. Alternatively, there may be an increase in sensitivity to JA or related compounds following infection. Hormone measurements showed that the oxylipin signal must precede subsequent increases in ethylene and SA accumulation. Tomato thus actively regulates the Xcv-induced disease response via the sequential action of at least three hormones, promoting expansive cell death of its own tissue. This sequential action of jasmonate, ethylene, and SA in <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> development is different from the hormone interactions observed in many other plant-pathogen interactions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVETo {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} and combined regulation of elements of symptom patterns in the diagnosis of insomnia with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). METHODSThe samples were collected from the patients, diagnosed with insomnia, of Henan Province Hospital of TCM between June 2011 and September 2013. The symptom patterns in insomnia were extracted. Next, symptom differentiation, characteristics of polysomnography (PSG), distribution and combined regulation of these symptom patterns were conducted by tests. RESULTSIn total, 286 eligible patients were recruited. The main locations of the <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> elements were the brain and heart, and the main characteristics of the <b>disease</b> <b>symptom</b> elements were phlegm-heat, Yin-deficiency and Qi-stagnation. The elements from two or three symptom patterns were commonly manifested in patients with insomnia, especially from three symptom patterns. We also found that all TCM symptom patterns {{had an effect on}} polysomnographic indicators in PSG tests. CONCLUSIONSThe elements of symptom patterns in insomnia were identified as mainly fire-heat and phlegm-heat. The most common patterns of excess were pathogenic fire derived from stagnation of liver-Qi, and mental disturbance due to phlegm-heat, while the most common patterns of deficiency in both the heart and the spleen.

40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the leading}} cause for {{respiratory}} illness that requires hospitalization in infancy. High levels of maternal antibodies can protect against RSV infection. However, RSV-infected infants can suffer from severe <b>disease</b> <b>symptoms</b> even in the presence of high levels of RSV-specific antibodies. This study analyzes several serological characteristics to explore potential deficiencies or surpluses of antibodies that could relate to severe <b>disease</b> <b>symptoms.</b> We compare serum antibodies from hospitalized patients who suffered severe symptoms as well as uninfected infants. Disease severity markers were oxygen therapy, tachypnea, oxygen saturation, admission to the intensive care unit and duration of hospitalization. Antibodies against RSV G protein and a prefusion F epitope correlated with in vitro neutralization. Avidity of RSV-specific IgG antibodies was lower in RSV-infected infants compared to uninfected controls. Severe <b>disease</b> <b>symptoms</b> were unrelated to RSV-specific IgG antibody titers, avidity of RSV-IgG, virus neutralization capacity or titers against pre- and postfusion F or G protein ectodomains and the prefusion F antigenic site O.
