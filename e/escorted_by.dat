5|$|Meanwhile, Gerhard Schöpfel, leading III./JG 26 and Bf 109s from JG 3, 40 in total, {{were already}} {{crossing}} the Dover straits {{to sweep the}} skies clear of the main raid. Some 25 miles behind him were the 27 Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> 20 Bf 110s that were to strike Kenley. Close by the Dorniers were the Ju 88s of III./KG 76 <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> Bf 109s from JG 51. This formation should have been 15 miles in front. Some 15 miles {{to the rear of}} the Ju88s, KG 1's He 111s were bound for Biggin Hill, <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> 40 Bf 109s from JG 54. The formations were moving at around three miles per minute, at 12,000 feet. Around 50 miles to the south-west, the nine Do 17s of 9 Staffel were at wave-top height, halfway between Dieppe, Seine-Maritime and Beachy Head, intent on sneaking under British radar beams unobserved. Altogether, the raiding force contained 108 bombers and 150 fighters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 had begun when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in the eastern Mediterranean and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E
5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> {{a pair of}} Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew {{a patrol}} over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed engine trouble and {{had to return to}} base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine trouble and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E

On 10 February 1945, after a bridge-busting sortie on the Drava, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z bombed the Partisans' 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) near Daruvar, inflicting two dozen casualties. Late in the afternoon of 30 March, four Dornier Do 17Z bombers, <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> four Bf 109G fighters attacked the Partisans near Gospić.

5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the Jaguar {{proved to}} be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always <b>escorted</b> <b>by</b> {{at least one other}} RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E
