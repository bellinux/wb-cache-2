25|$|The Gryffindor {{common room}} {{is in one}} of the castle's highest towers, and its {{entrance}} is on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a painting of The <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady,</b> who is garbed in a pink dress. She permits entry only after being given the correct password, as was distinguished in the third book, when Sirius Black tried forcing entry into the tower, only to be blocked by The <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> after he could not give the correct password. In the first book, Neville Longbottom tends to forget the password and must wait near the painting until other Gryffindors arrive to open the way.|$|E
25|$|Retro-camp {{fashion is}} an example of modern hipsters {{employing}} camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions. The classic camp yard ornament is the pink plastic flamingo. The yard globe, garden gnome, wooden cut-out of a <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a lawn jockey) and ceramic statues of white-tailed deer are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Comic Relief {{performed}} a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan. It featured Dawn French {{as a female}} Harry; Jennifer Saunders as Ron Weasley and J. K.

The broadcast of this parody was preceded by a message from J. K. Rowling. French subsequently received a role as The <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> in 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The end of Secret Chamberpot featured an advert for the sequel, Gobs of Fire, which was never made. It is unknown whether it was ever planned, {{or if it was}} just a spoof.|$|E

25|$|As an artist, Shovelton {{began with}} scraperboard and ink drawing and later turned to {{watercolour}} painting. He {{also became a}} skilled calligrapher. He designed posters, flyers and other artwork for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including the programme cover for the company's {{last night at the}} Adelphi Theatre, as well as for all the Gawsworth Hall productions. He created the book covers and illustrated poem collections by his former tutor and friend, the geographer Jay Appleton.

Shovelton also created numerous Gilbert and Sullivan themed Christmas, greeting and note cards, and was a keen photographer. He provided the cover illustration for a novel by Tony Joseph, The Diary of April March, and illustrated two books of poetry by his former tutor at Hull, Jay Appleton (Grains Among the Chaff and Enter the <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady)</b> and all three editions of Harry Benford's The Gilbert and Sullivan Lexicon (1978, 1991 and 1999).|$|E
500|$|References to China {{appear in}} the album's songs, {{including}} in [...] "Burning Airlines Give You So Much More", [...] "China My China" [...] and [...] "Taking Tiger Mountain". Steve Huey of AllMusic described these combined themes as a loose concept album that is [...] "often inscrutable, but still playful – about espionage, the Chinese Communist revolution, and dream associations." [...] On the political theme within the lyrics and album title, Eno explained that he is [...] "not Maoist or anything like that; if anything I'm anti-Maoist". The album addresses several different esoteric topics. [...] "Burning Airlines Give You So Much More" [...] is inspired by a 1974 crash near Paris of a Turkish Airlines DC-10, {{one of the worst}} air crashes in history. [...] "The <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> of Limbourg", described by Eno as a [...] "Burroughs-type song" [...] about an asylum in Limbourg, Belgium where the residents of it outnumber the population of the town. [...] "The Great Pretender" [...] describes the rape of a suburban housewife by a crazed machine. [...] "Third Uncle" [...] has been referred to as an early predecessor of punk music. Judy Nylon is the Judy in [...] "Back in Judy's Jungle".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was also criticized {{because of the}} popular stereotype that female opera singers have to be heavy anyway, {{in order to do}} a good job. There is the old expression that [...] "in opera, great voices often come in large packages". and the well-worn saying about opera that [...] "It ain't over till the <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> sings". She was headlined in the British tabloid press as [...] "The show ain't over till the <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> slims." [...] There was also an outcry because, it seemed at the time, that high culture performing arts, such as opera, should not emulate low culture Hollywood images of thin female stars.|$|E

2500|$|The Fat Lady's portrait, which guards the Gryffindor quarters, {{is found}} ruined and empty.

2500|$|The {{photographs}} and portraits {{in the world}} of wizards are not stationary like in the Muggle world. They move around within the frame and from one portrait to another, and are also able to talk if they are developed in a certain potion. A portrait of the <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> is used in Hogwarts to cover the door to the Gryffindor common room and opens only when she is given the password. Also, there are various paintings of old Headmasters and Headmistresses of Hogwarts in Dumbledore's office, and he is shown to be in discussion with them from time to time. He also uses the portrait of Phineas Nigellus, Sirius Black's great grandfather, to communicate with Sirius and to keep a watch at the Order's Headquarters through another portrait of Phineas in the house. The headmaster portraits are special, not simply {{due to the fact that}} they appear in them because of their death. [...] The reason for this is that part of their soul stays behind in their portrait.|$|E
2500|$|After Tracy {{eventually}} made {{it on the}} show, there was a song [...] "The New Girl in Town", which was sung first by the Council girls and later by the black Girls. Although later cut early during the Seattle tryout, it {{was included in the}} 2007 film and appears in the show’s instrumental score. [...] "The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha" [...] was another cut number that originally followed [...] "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful". [...] Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene. A song called [...] "Step on Up" [...] was also cut in favor of [...] "I Know Where I’ve Been". Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a [...] "Miss Auto Show" [...] competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of [...] "Miss Teenage Hairspray". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called [...] "Take a Spin" [...] sung by Corny in the place where “(It’s) Hairspray” is now. After Amber’s rendition of [...] "Cooties", Tracy had a song before the finale called [...] "It Ain’t Over ’Til the <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> Sings," [...] though, it was cut after the third reading of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.|$|E
