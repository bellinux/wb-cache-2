40|$|BACKGROUND: Persulfate salts {{have been}} {{associated}} with both allergic contact dermatitis and bronchial asthma. Because there is currently no experimental data available on the sensitizing properties of persulfate salts (ammonium, sodium, and potassium persulfates), we determined their dermal sensitizing capacity, using the murine local <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> assay (LLNA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: For three consecutive days, BALB/c mice were dermally treated with ammonium, sodium, or potassium persulfate or with the vehicle alone (dimethyl sulfoxide) on each ear (2 x 25 microl). On D 6, mice were injected intravenously with [(3) H]-methyl thymidine. The <b>draining</b> <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were removed, and the incorporation of [(3) H]-methyl thymidine was compared with that of vehicle-treated control mice. A stimulation index (SI) relative to the vehicle-treated control value was derived. The sensitizing potency of the chemicals tested was determined by estimating the concentration of chemical required to induce a SI of 3 (EC 3). RESULTS: All three chemicals provoked positive responses in the LLNA, with dose-dependent increases in proliferation. Maximal SIs recorded were 6. 8 +/- 1. 8, 6. 5 +/- 1. 2, and 5 +/- 1. 0 at 5 % for ammonium, sodium or potassium persulfate, respectively. The EC 3 values were 1. 9 %, 0. 9 %, and 2. 4 % for ammonium, sodium, and potassium persulfates, respectively.

We used this test to compare the sensitization potential of NiSO 4, K 2 Cr 2 O 7, CoCl 2, Na 2 PtCl 6 and BeSO 4, salts of metals which have all been associated with allergic contact dermatitis and either bronchial asthma orinterstitial lung disease, by either humoral or cell-mediated allergic mechanisms. BALB/c mice (n = 3 per concentration studied, three concentrations studied per metal) received three daily applications of the metal salt (in DMSO) on the dorsum of both ears. On the fourth day the <b>draining</b> <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were removed and the incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine in the lymphocytes in culture was {{compared to that of}} concurrent vehicle-treated control mice, thus enabling to derive a stimulation index (SI), indicative of immunological sensitization potential. Each experiment was performed three times. Oxazolone and toluene diisocyanate, chosen as positive controls, yielded strongly positive SI values (> 20 and > 30 respectively). Na 2 PtCl 6 (SI 2. 6 +/- 1. 0 at 2. 5 %), CoCl 2 (SI 2. 8 +/- 0. 5 at 5 %) and possibly also K 2 Cr 2 O 7 (SI 2. 1 +/- 1. 2 at 0. 5 %) were positive in the LLNA, whereas NiSO 4 (SI 0. 9 +/- 0. 2 at 5 %) and BeSO 4 (SI 1. 3 +/- 0. 6 at 4 %) were negative. Although our results are still limited by the fact that only one mice strain was tested, they indicate that there is no strict relationship between the sensitization potential of metal salts, as evaluated in the murine LLNA, and their potential to cause either respiratory or dermal allergic disease. Consequently, caution should be exercised before proposing the murine LLNA as a valid test to predict the sensitization potential of low molecular weight chemicals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Migration of Langerhans cells (LCs) {{from the}} skin to the lymph node is an {{essential}} step in the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Therefore, inhibition of LC-migration could be a promising strategy to improve this skin disease. Effects of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) and the immunomodulator FTY 720 on LC trafficking is not well defined, yet. Thus, we investigated the action of topically administered S 1 P and FTY 720 in a murine model of ACD. Most interestingly, FTY 720 as well as S 1 P inhibited the inflammatory reaction in the elicitation phase of ACD. In the sensitization phase, FTY 720, and S 1 P reduced the weight and cell count of the <b>draining</b> <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> as well as immigrated dendritic cells provoked by repetitive topical administration of the hapten. Correspondingly, the density of LCs in the epidermis was higher in FTY 720 - and S 1 P-treated mice compared to vehicle treatment. A skin dendritic cell migration assay confirmed the significant inhibition of dendritic cell migration by FTY 720 and S 1 P. These data supply conclusive evidence that the strategy of targeting the migratory response of LCs with locally acting S 1 P or FTY 720 represents an emerging option {{in the treatment of}} allergic skin diseases like contact hypersensitivity and atopic dermatitis...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To compare the in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory effects of the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor cilomilast with those of tacrolimus and rapamycin. METHODS: The in vitro action of cilomilast, tacrolimus and rapamycin were tested in a mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR). In vivo, the inhibitory action of the immunomodulatory drugs was compared in the toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) -induced allergic inflammatory response with particular focus on dendritic cell (DC) function. RESULTS: Cilomilast, tacrolimus and rapamycin were all able to inhibit DC-mediated T-cell activation in a MLR. But it was demonstrated for cilomilast that the target cells are T cells rather than DC. In vivo, a combination of systemic and topical administration of each of these three substances significantly inhibited swelling in the murine ear 16 h after TDI challenge. There was also a reduction in the weight of the <b>draining</b> <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> in lymphocyte cell count, and in the number of emigrated DC. The density of Langerhans cells in the epidermis was correspondingly higher in mice treated with cilomilast, tacrolimus and rapamycin than in those treated with vehicle. All three substances were found to inhibit DC migration ex vivo in a skin DC migration assay performed on ear tissue after TDI challenge. CONCLUSIONS: DC migration into the draining lymph node also takes place in the elicitation phase of allergic contact dermatitis and this migration can be influenced by tacrolimus and rapamycin, and, to a lesser extent, by cilomilast...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Type 1 {{diabetes}} is an autoimmune disease, while {{allergic contact dermatitis}} although immune mediated, is considered an exposure driven disease that develops due to epicutaneous contact with reactive low-molecular chemicals. The objective {{of the present study}} was to experimentally study the effect of contact allergens on the development of diabetes in NOD mice. As the link between contact allergy and {{diabetes is}} yet unexplained we also examined the effect of provocation with allergens on Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, since involvement of NKT cells could suggest an innate connection between the two diseases. METHOD: NOD mice 4 weeks of age were exposed, on the ears, to two allergens, p-phenylenediamine and 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene respectively, to investigate the diabetes development. The mice were followed for a maximum of 32 weeks, and they were either repeatedly exposed to the allergens or only sensitized a week after arrival. The stimulation of NKT cells by the two allergens were additionally studied in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The mice were sensitized and two weeks later provocated with the allergens. The mice were subsequently euthanized at different time points after the provocation. RESULTS: It was found that repeated application of p-phenylenediamine reduced the incidence of diabetes compared to application with water (47 % vs. 93 %, P = 0. 004). Moreover it was shown that in C 57 BL/ 6 mice both allergens resulted in a slight increment in the quantity of NKT cells in the liver. Application of the allergens at the same time resulted in an increased number of NKT cells in the <b>draining</b> <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> and the increase appeared to be somewhat allergen specific as the accumulation was stronger for p-phenylenediamine. CONCLUSION: The study showed that repeated topical application on the ears with a contact allergen could prevent the development of diabetes in NOD mice. The contact allergens gave a non-visible, sub-clinical dermatitis on the application site. The preventive effect on diabetes may be due to stimulation of peripheral NKT cells, as shown for provocation with p-phenylenediamine in the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse. This epicutaneous procedure may lead to new strategies in prevention of type 1 diabetes in humans...|$|E

Resident skin dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages did not play a predominant role in early BCG capture and transport to ADLN. The main BCG host cells rapidly recruited both in the dermis and ADLN were neutrophils. Fluorescent green or red BCG strains injected into non-overlapping sites were essentially sheltered by distinct neutrophils in the ADLN capsule indicating that neutrophils had captured bacilli in peripheral tissue and transported them to the lymphoid organ. Strikingly, we observed BCG-infected neutrophils in the lumen of lymphatic vessels by confocal microscopy on ear dermis. Fluorescent-labeled neutrophils injected into the ears, accumulated exclusively into the ipsilateral ADLN capsule after BCG vaccination. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence that neutrophils, like DCs or inflammatory monocytes, migrate via afferent lymphatics to lymphoid tissue and can shuttle live microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Years after {{removal from}} exposure, workers with {{occupational}} asthma still show respiratory symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness on re-exposure to the offending agent. OBJECTIVE: We investigated {{the persistence of}} the respiratory responsiveness to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in a mouse model. METHODS: BALB/C mice received dermal applications of TDI on days 1 and 8, and a single intranasal instillation of TDI on day 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 90. After instillation, early (1 hour) changes in ventilatory function and methacholine responsiveness (22 hours) were assessed. Cell counts and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage. Total serum IgE, IgG(1), and IgG(2 a) were quantified. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed in <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and release of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma by these <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells was measured. RESULTS: Toluene diisocyanate-treated mice showed immediate ventilatory changes, increased methacholine reactivity, and an influx of neutrophils and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 in bronchoalveolar lavage as long as 50 days after initial treatment. These mice also showed a relative increase in CD 19 (+) cells and a decrease in CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells in <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Increased release of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma in <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells was observed only until 20 days after sensitization.

BALB/c and severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice received toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or vehicle on each ear on day 1 and/or day 7. On day 10, they were intranasally challenged with TDI or vehicle. Ventilatory function was monitored by whole body plethysmography for 40 min after challenge. Reactivity to methacholine was measured 23 h later: enhanced pause and actual resistance measurements. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed 1, 6, and 24 h after challenge by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2 levels were measured in BAL. Immunological parameters included total IgE, IgG 1, and IgG 2 a in serum, lymphocyte populations in <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels in supernatants of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells, cultured with or without concanavalin A.

Up to 15 % of all asthma cases in adults are due to chemical exposures at the workplace. The early identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein level. Methods: On days 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with 0. 3 % toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI, 20 µl), or the vehicle (2 : 3, acetone-olive oil).

Up to 15 % of all asthma cases in adults are due to chemical exposures at the workplace. Initially, the exposed workers do not show asthmatic symptoms but are getting sensitized. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein level. Methods On day 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with 0, 3 % toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a known respiratory sensitizer, 3 % TDI or a mixture of acetone – olive oil (vehicle-control). On day 15 mice are sacrificed and <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are collected and prepared for proteome analysis. In a second study, mice are sensitized with 0, 3 % TDI or a mixture of acetone – olive oil on day 1 and 8. On day 15, mice are oropharyngeally challenged with 0, 01 % TDI or acetone – olive oil. One day later, on day 16, lung function measurements are carried out to select responders from non-responders. The <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of selected mice are subjected to proteome analysis. In both studies two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) was used to analyze the differential expression of proteins in the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of TDI (0, 3 % or 3 %) and vehicle-treated (control) mice. Results In the first study, three conditions were compared in one 2 D-DIGE analysis. In total, 35, 36 and 12 proteins were found differentially expressed between 0, 3 % TDI and control, 3 % TDI and control and 0, 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively.

40|$|Occupational asthma (OA) is {{the most}} common work-related lung disease in the industrialized world and is {{characterized}} by reversible airway obstruction, non-specific airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation. In 90 % of the cases, a complaints-free latency period precedes the development of immunologically mediated OA resulting in late diagnosis of these workers. Proteomics and peptidomics techniques could help to find (new) proteins or peptides related to the pathophysiology and onset of OA, leading to novel biomarkers to identify sensitized workers. So far, theuse of these techniques in pulmonary research is limited. The research unit of Lung Toxicology has described a well-characterized and validated mouse model of chemical-induced asthma. Two dermal sensitizations and a single airway challenge with a chemical sensitizer, such as toluene diisocyanate resulted in several phenotypical characteristics of chemical-induced asthma, including lymphocyte proliferation and activation, non-specific airway hyperreactivity and neutrophilic lung inflammation. In this doctoral thesis we focused on:a) applying a proteomics approach to find biomarkers of sensitization caused by chemicals and biomarkers of chemical-induced asthma (Chapter 2 and 3) b) investigating the role of B lymphocytes during sensitization (Chapter 4) c) optimizing a label-free peptidomics approach to study peptide biomarkers (Chapter 5) We used two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) to search for possible biomarkers of sensitization in <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and serum of mice that were sensitized once andtwice. In the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{a large portion of the}} differentially expressed proteins are structural proteins (e. g. actin, vimentin), while another substantial group are immune related proteins (e. g. lymphocyte specific protein- 1, coronin 1 a). Most of the identified proteins in serum, after one or two sensitizations are involved in binding/transport (e. g. hemopexin, apolipoprotein E). Three potential biomarkers, lymphocyte specific protein- 1, coronin 1 a and hemopexin, were verified in an independent experiment by Western blot analysis or ELISA. In a next step, we aim to validate this set of proteins in TDI-exposed workerswith the potential of advancing early diagnosis of OA. To investigate possible biomarkers of disease (chemical-induced asthma), we compared the proteome changes in <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum of mice after the establishment of asthma. A majority of differentially expressed proteins (e. g. lymphocyte specific protein- 1, vitamin D binding protein, apolipoprotein E, hemopexin and haptoglobin) could be directly linked to inflammation (both locally in the lung as systemically in serum), a hallmark of asthma. For the first time,a systematic proteomics approach was implemented using different samples obtained from the same mice in the setting of chemical-induced asthma. The role of B lymphocytes in the development of chemical-induced asthma is still unclear. Recently, it was shown that B lymphocytes from sensitized mice could carry a sensitized signature compared to B lymphocytes of naïve mice. We isolated B lymphocytes from sensitized and non-sensitized mice and studied this sensitized signature by using 2 D-DIGE. The altered expression of cyclophilin A, cofilin 1 and zinc finger containing CCHC domain protein 11 in sensitized B lymphocytes could be linked directly to the function of B lymphocytes as initiators of T lymphocyte independent asthma-like responses.

With this approach, it is possible to assess whether or not responses from mixtures of sensitizers can be predicted from the dose-response information obtained from individual chemicals using dose addition. We selected the skin sensitizers isoeugenol and cinnamal, frequently occurring together in consumer products, to be examined in an adjusted local <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> assay (LLNA). Cell number and cytokine production (IL- 10 and IFN-c) of the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were measured as hallmarks of the skin sensitization response. We found that dose addition for these 2 skin sensitizers closely predicted the effects from mixtures of both chemicals across the broad dose range tested. Hence, isoeugenol and cinnamal show no synergistic effects in the LLNA. Therefore, hazard assessment and risk assessment of these substances can be performed without taking into account mixture exposure.

40|$|Introduction: Up to 15 % of all asthma {{cases in}} adults {{are due to}} {{chemical}} exposures at the workplace. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein and peptide level. Methods: On days 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with toluene diisocyanate (TDI, 0. 3 % or 3 %, 20 µl), a known respiratory sensitizer, or a mixture of acetone – olive oil (AOO, vehicle-control). On day 15, <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are collected and homogenized. We used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) to analyze the differential expression of proteins in TDI and vehicle-treated <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Results: Body weight of control mice and TDI-treated mice did not differ. Interestingly, the weight of <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> significantly increased with an increasing concentration of TDI. 2 D-DIGE analysis of these <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> showed 35, 36 and 12 differential proteins comparing 0. 3 % and AOO, 3 % TDI and AOO and 0. 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively. 17 proteins are already identified, among which several structural proteins and lymphocyte specific protein- 1. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the use of 2 D-DIGE {{in the search for}} (early) biomarkers of chemical-induced asthma. Further studies will have to point out whether (some of) these proteins could act as valuable biomarkers. Therefore, more samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum,…) will be analysed. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational asthma can {{be caused}} by chemicals. Previously, we {{established}} a murine model of immunologically mediated chemical-induced asthma using toluene diisocyanate. OBJECTIVE: We sought to verify this model using trimellitic anhydride (TMA), a respiratory sensitizer, and 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (DNCB), a dermal sensitizer. METHODS: BALB/c mice received dermal applications (vehicle or chemical) on days 1 and 7. On day 10, they received an intranasal instillation (vehicle or chemical). Whole-body plethysmography (enhanced pause) was used to monitor changes in ventilatory function and methacholine reactivity. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by using bronchoalveolar lavage (cells, TNF-alpha levels, and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 levels). Immunologic parameters included total serum IgE levels, lymphocyte distribution in <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels in supernatants of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells incubated with or without concanavalin A. RESULTS: Mice dermally treated and intranasally challenged with TMA experienced markedly increased enhanced pause immediately after intranasal challenge and increased methacholine reactivity (24 hours later). Mice similarly treated with DNCB did not show any ventilatory changes. Neutrophil influx and increased macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and TNF-alpha levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both TMA- and DNCB-treated mice. The proportion of CD 19 + B cells was increased in <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of TMA-treated mice. IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels were increased in supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells of TMA- or DNCB-treated mice; however, the relative proportions of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels differed between TMA- and DNCB-treated mice. Serum total IgE levels were increased in TMA-treated mice only. CONCLUSION: Both compounds induce a mixed T(H) 1 -T(H) 2 response, but only TMA induced ventilatory changes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In the workplace avoiding skin contact with chemical sensitizers might be advised to prevent chemical-induced asthma. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Adult onset Still's {{disease is}} a chronic {{multisystemic}} inflammatory disorder characterized by high spiking fever, polyarthralgia and rash. Lymphadenopathy is a prominent feature of adult onset Still's disease and is seen in about 65 % of patients. Searching the medical literature using the MEDLINE database from January 1966 through November 2007 we could only find two reported cases of adult onset Still's disease that had progressed to lymphoma. Case presentation We describe {{a woman who was}} diagnosed with adult onset Still's disease and developed lymphoma 10 months after the onset of her symptoms. She initially presented with fever and arthritis of the knees, ankles and shoulders, along with a nonpruritic skin rash, myalgia and weight loss. On physical examination she was found to have several enlarged anterior cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and left posterior <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> all of which were non-tender, immobile and rubbery. Excisional biopsy of the cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was negative for malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy was also negative for malignancy. She was treated with prednisone. She remained in good health until she presented 10 months later with low back pain, dyspnea and weight loss. Work up revealed malignant lymphoma. She was treated with chemotherapy and was doing well until she presented with abdominal pain. Work up revealed a cirrhotic liver and ascites. She then passed away from hepatorenal syndrome 13 years after the diagnosis of lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of such an occurrence. Conclusion Although the association between adult onset Still's disease and lymphoma has been rarely reported, careful screening for this malignancy in patients suspected to have adult onset Still's disease is warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the route of challenge in an existing mouse model of chemicalinduced asthma, we replaced intranasal instillation by oropharyngeal aspiration. To our knowledge, oropharyngeal aspiration as a challenge route has not yet been investigated in a mouse model of chemicalinduced asthma. Methods:Ondays 1 and 8, micewere dermally sensitized with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (0. 3 %) [or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) ] and on day 15 they received a single challenge, via oropharyngeal aspiration, with TDI (0. 01 %) or vehicle. One day after challenge, airway reactivity to methacholine was measured by a forced oscillation technique (FlexiVent) and total and differential cell counts, as well as levels of KC, IL- 5, IL- 17 and TNF-a, were assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Lymphocytes from the <b>auricular</b> and mediastinal <b>lymph</b> nodeswere cultured to determine the concanavaline A-induced secretion of IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13, IL- 17 and IFN-g. Total serum IgE was measured. Results: In TDI-sensitized mice, a significant increase in airway reactivitywas found after a single oropharyngeal challenge with TDI. BAL neutrophils and eosinophils were increased 7 - and 5 -fold, respectively. An upregulation of Th 1 (IFN-g), Th 2 (IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13) and Th 17 (IL- 17) cytokines was found in the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> in the mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> only IL- 4 was upregulated. The total serum IgE level in TDI-sensitized mice was significantly increased when compared to control mice. Conclusion: We conclude that challenging mice via oropharyngeal aspiration mimics the characteristics of human asthma well, without the possible drawbacks of other techniques. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{previous}} studies, several {{strains of}} mice {{were used as}} chemical-induced skin irritation models to identify immunological hazards and elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which irritant dermatitis disease occur. BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{have been used for}} most of these experiments. Although there are some differences in the immune response to chemical allergens between these strains, few studies have been conducted to determine what regulatory factors contribute to these variations. Methods: To investigate the cause of high responses to skin irritation in C 57 BL/ 6 mice that are widely used to study atopic dermatitis, changes in various immune-related factors such as ear thickness, myeloperoxidase activity, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> weight, IgE concentration and cytokine concentration were measured in C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice following phthalic anhydride (PA) treatment. Results: Based on analysis of the skin irritation, C 57 BL/ 6 mice showed a greater skin irritation to PA than BALB/c mice, although the IgE concentration and <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> weight did not contribute to this difference in the response. However, the concentration of several cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]- 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC] and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]) were significantly higher in C 57 BL/ 6 mice than BALB/c mice following treatment with PA. Conclusions: Our results suggest that several of the cytokines and chemokines secreted from irritant site could contribute to the regulation mechanism responsible for the difference in the skin irritation among various strains of mice following exposure to PA...|$|R
40|$|Methylisothiazolinone (MI), {{a widely}} used {{chemical}} preservative in industrial and household products, and cosmetics, {{has been associated}} with allergic contact dermatitis. However, the asthmogenic capacity of MI is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the capacity of MI to elicit asthma-like responses in a validated mouse model. On days 1 and 8, mice (C 57 Bl/ 6 and BALB/c) were dermally treated with MI or vehicle on each ear. On day 15, mice received a single intranasal challenge with MI or vehicle. Immediately after the challenge, the early ventilatory response was measured using a double chamber plethysmograph. One day later, airway hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation and immune-related parameters were assessed. Dermal treatment with MI in both C 57 Bl/ 6 and BALB/c mice induced increased T- and B-cell proliferation in the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> along with IFN-γ production and limited increases in total serum IgE, confirming dermal sensitization. An airway challenge with MI led to an early ventilatory response (decreased breathing frequency), indicative for acute sensory irritation. However, 24 h later no allergic respiratory response (no airway hyperreactivity (AHR) nor pulmonary inflammation) was found in either mouse strains. Our study indicates that MI can be classified as a strong dermal sensitizer and irritant, but not an asthmogen after initial dermal sensitization, followed by an airway challenge. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{optimized}} an {{adoptive transfer}} protocol in our mouse model of TDI-induced asthma {{in order to}} investigate the mechanisms {{of this type of}} occupational asthma. METHODS: On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice were dermally sensitized with 0. 3 % TDI or vehicle (acetone/olive oil), and on day 15, they were sacrificed and a cell suspension was made from <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> First, 0. 1 × 10 (6), 0. 5 × 10 (6), 1 × 10 (6) or 5 × 10 (6) cells were injected intravenously into naïve mice and three days later these mice received an oropharyngeal challenge with 0. 01 % TDI or vehicle. Second, mice were challenged with 0. 01 % TDI 1, 3, 5 or 7 days after transferring 0. 5 × 10 (6) cells. The following endpoints were measured one day after challenge: methacholine reactivity; differential cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and total serum IgE. RESULTS: Naïve mice receiving 0. 5 × 10 (6), 1 × 10 (6) or 5 × 10 (6) cells showed significant increases in airway reactivity one day after TDI challenge; BAL neutrophils were increased after transferring 0. 5 × 10 (6) and 1 × 10 (6) cells. A TDI challenge 3 days after transferring 0. 5 × 10 (6) cells gave a 3 -fold increase in airway resistance and a pronounced airway inflammation, whereas challenging at other time points gave no differences. CONCLUSION: We were able to passively sensitize naïve mice using <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells from TDI-sensitized mice, resulting in an asthma-like response after an airway challenge. In comparison to other adoptive transfer protocols we used substantially lower number of cells to obtain the desired response. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we showed, using SCID mice, that {{lymphocytes}} play {{an important}} role in a model of chemical-induced asthma. We investigated whether adoptive transfer studies would confirm the role of lymphocytes during sensitization. BALB/c mice where dermally sensitized on day 1 and 8 with 0. 3 % toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) (20 µl/ear). On day 15, these mice were sacrificed and <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were processed to obtain a cell suspension. These cells (0. 5 x 106 or 1 x 106 cells) were injected intravenously into naïve mice. Three days later they received an intranasal challenge with 0. 1 % TDI or vehicle. Early airway response (Penh) was measured immediately after the challenge. One day later methacholine reactivity was assessed and the mice were sacrificed for cellular and immunological analysis in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Naïve mice receiving lymphocytes from TDI-sensitized mice showed a three fold increase in early ventilatory response, compared to control mice, when challenged three days after passive sensitization. We found only a slight airway hyperreactivity in these mice. Nevertheless, they showed clear signs of airway inflammation in BAL, mainly characterized by an influx of neutrophils (20 %). We were able to passively sensitize naïve mice with lymphocytes from TDI-sensitized mice and this yielded an asthmatic response after an airway challenge. These experiments are the onset of a series of experiments in which subpopulations of specific lymphocytes will be transferred to define which lymphocyte types are most important in the development of chemical-induced asthma. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|While the {{importance}} of the Th 2 cytokine IL- 13 as a central mediator of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) has been described in allergic protein-induced asthma, this has never been investigated in chemical-induced asthma. We examined {{the importance}} of IL- 13 in a mouse model of chemical-induced AHR, using toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI). In a first set-up, wild type (WT) and IL- 13 knockout (KO) C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were dermally treated on days 1 and 8 with 1 % TDI or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) on both ears. On day 15, mice received an intranasal instillation with 0. 1 % TDI or vehicle. In a second set-up, WT mice sensitized with 1 % TDI or vehicle, received i. v. either anti-IL- 13 or control antibody prior to the intranasal challenge. TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged WT mice showed AHR to methacholine, in contrast to TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged IL- 13 KO mice, which also showed lower levels of total serum IgE. TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged IL- 13 KO mice had lower numbers of T-cells in the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> TDI-treated WT mice, receiving anti-IL- 13, showed no AHR, in contrast to those receiving control antibody, despite increased levels of IgE. Anti-IL- 13 treatment in TDI-treated WT mice resulted in lower levels of serum IL- 13, but did not induce changes in T- and B-cell numbers, and in the cytokine production profile. We conclude that IL- 13 plays a critical role in the effector phase of chemical-induced, immune-mediated AHR. This implicates that anti-IL- 13 treatment could have a beneficial effect in patients with this asthma phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Background: Persulfate salts are {{the main}} cause of {{occupational}} asthma (OA) in hairdressers. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify whether ammonium persulfate ((NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8, AP) is capable of triggering an asthma-like response in mice. Methods: BALB/c mice were dermally treated on days 1 and 8, with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1 % AP or 5 % AP (20 ml/ear). On day 15, the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were removed and an in vitro lymphocyte proliferation test (LPT) was performed. AP was tested for its ability to elicit an asthmatic response using a locally developed mouse model of chemical-induced asthma. On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice received 20 ml AP (5 %) or DMSO on each ear. On day 15, they received an intranasal instillation of AP (1 %) or saline. Afterwards, ventilatory, inflammatory and immunological parameters were assessed. Results: The LPT showed that in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes with AP leads to specific proliferation of lymphocytes from AP-sensitised mice. In vivo, AP induced, in AP-sensitised mice only, an ‘early’ ventilatory response (increased Penh (enhanced pause)) immediately after challenge, and airway hyper-reactivity to methacholine 22 h later. Pulmonary inflammation was mainly characterised by neutrophils (10 e 15 %). AP sensitised mice showed an increase in total number of T helper (Th) and B lymphocytes together with an increased in vitro secretion of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 10 and IL- 13 and an increase in total serum immunoglobulin E.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} of an established model of chemical-induced asthma, we transferred B- lymphocytes from sensitized mice to naïve mice. BALB/c mice where dermally sensitized with 0. 3 % TDI (20 µl/ear), on day 1 and 8. On day 15, mice were sacrificed and the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> isolated. B-lymphocytes (CD 19 +) where separated from the whole cell suspension and 175, 000 cells where injected in the tail vein of naïve mice. Three days later, these mice received a single oropharyngeal challenge with 0. 01 % TDI (20 µl) or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) (controls). Airway reactivity to methacholine (resistance assessed by forced oscillation method, FlexiVent) and total and differential cell counts in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were measured 24 hours after challenge. Mice that received B-lymphocytes from TDI-sensitized mice showed a 3 -fold increase in methacholine reactivity and an 8 -fold increase in BAL neutrophils after challenge with TDI, compared to those challenged with vehicle. Transfer of the whole cell suspension without CD 19 + lymphocytes (325, 000 cells) resulted in a less pronounced airway reactivity to methacholine (1. 5 -fold) and a lower influx of neutrophils (1. 3 -fold) in the lungs. We were able to passively sensitize naïve mice with B-lymphocytes from TDI-sensitized mice. Following passive sensitization and an airway challenge with TDI, these mice showed an “asthmatic” response. These data suggest a role for B-lymphocytes beside the already known important role of T-helper lymphocytes in chemical-induced asthma.

40|$|T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes are {{key players}} in {{allergic}} asthma, with B-lymphocytes producing antigen-specific immunoglobulins E (IgE). We used a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma and transferred B-lymphocytes from sensitized animals into naïve wild type mice, B-lymphocyte knock-out (B-KO) mice or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice were dermally sensitized with 0. 3 % toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (20 µl/ear). On day 15, mice were euthanized and the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> isolated. B-lymphocytes (CD 19 (+)) were separated from the whole cell suspension and 175, 000 cells were injected in the tail vein of naïve wild type, B-KO or SCID mice. Three days later, the mice received a single oropharyngeal challenge with 0. 01 % TDI (20 µl) or vehicle (acetone/olive oil (AOO)) (controls). Airway reactivity to methacholine and total and differential cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were measured 24 hours after challenge. B-lymphocytes of AOO or TDI-sensitized mice were characterized {{for the expression of}} surface markers and production of cytokines. We found that transfer of B-cells obtained from mice dermally sensitized to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) into naïve wild type mice, B-KO mice or SCID mice led, within three days, to an acute asthma-like phenotype after an airway challenge with TDI. This response was specific and independent of IgE. These B-lymphocytes showed antigen presenting capacities (CD 80 /CD 86 and CD 40) and consisted of B effector (Be) 2 - (IL- 4) and Be 1 -lymphocytes (IFN-γ).

On day 1 and 7, BALB/c mice received TDI or vehicle (acetone/olive oil). On days 10, 13 and 16 the mice received an intranasal instillation of TDI. Ventilatory function (Penh) was monitored by whole body plethysmography for 40 min after each challenge. Reactivity to methacholine was measured 22 h later. Pulmonary inflammation, TNF-a and MIP- 2 levels were assessed 24 h after the last challenge by broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). Other immunological parameters included total IgE, lymphocyte subpopulations in <b>auricular</b> and cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and IL- 4, IFN-g and IL- 13 levels in supernatants of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells, cultured with or without concanavalin A.

40|$|Diisocyanates are {{the leading}} cause of chemical-induced {{occupational}} asthma. However, despite reductions in workplace respiratory exposures, isocyanate asthma continues to occur. This has prompted a focus on the skin as a route of sensitisation. We have produced immunologically mediated respiratory responses in mice after initial dermal sensitization using a respiratory sensitizer - toluene diisocyanate (TDI). 	Mice were dermally sensitized on days 1 and 8. On day 15, the mice receive a single respiratory challenge. Immediately after the challenge, the ‘early’ ventilatory response (40 min) was monitored and 22 h later airway hyperreactivity (AHR) upon methacholine provocation was measured. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. Analysed immune related parameters comprised total serum IgE and local draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> 	Mice sensitized and challenged with TDI showed immediate respiratory responses after challenge. Twenty two hours later, these mice showed pronounced AHR, compared to the controls, associated with a severe neutrophilic inflammation. TDI-sensitized and challenged mice showed, in the <b>auricular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> an increase in total number of T helper (CD 4 +), activated/regulatory T (CD 4 +CD 25 +), T cytotoxic (CD 8 +) and B (CD 19 +) lymphocytes together with an increased in vitro secretion of IFN-γ, IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13. An increase in total serum IgE was found. These data were confirmed by applying two other respiratory sensitizers in the model – trimelletic anhydride and ammonium persulfate – which both tested positive. If the model (using TDI) was performed in SCID mice (mice lacking T and B lymphocytes), none of the above described responses were found. 	We have been successful in our attempt to develop a model of chemical-induced asthma, with initial dermal sensitization, followed by a single airway challenge. Thereby confirming the skin/lung hypothesis, that dermal sensitization can lead to asthma-like responses. Furthermore, we showed that these skin/lung responses depend on the presence of lymphocytes. 1. Vanoirbeek JAJ, Tarkowski M, Ceuppens JL, Nemery B, Hoet PHM (2004).
