5|$|Barrett {{presented}} Xem as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as {{a natural}} and necessary further development of Aquino's Xeper. Aquino later acknowledged Xem as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> its exclusivity as incompatible with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> privacy.|$|E
60|$|She {{made her}} mother's brief meal with her such a misery of protests and <b>insistences</b> <b>on</b> {{pleadings}} {{with her father}} that poor Alice was fain to rejoice when the servants' presence silenced her, and fairly fled from her when the last dish was carried out.|$|R
50|$|Soviet commanders {{included}} Semyon Budyonny, Jakira (cavalry), Kotowski (cavalry). Budyonny's <b>insistence</b> (bordering <b>on</b> insubordination) on capturing Lwów {{has led to}} weakening Soviet forces near Warsaw and was {{a factor}} in their eventual defeat.|$|R
50|$|Ambrosio was {{eventually}} demoted to Inspector-General {{of the army}} by Badoglio in November 1943 <b>on</b> <b>insistence</b> of the allies who did not trust him.|$|R
5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and his <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.|$|E
5|$|Harlan {{complained to}} Goebbels {{that all the}} {{characters}} were negative; to this, Goebbels retorted that Harlan would not turn down the role of Richard III {{just because he was}} a negative character. However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E
5|$|His earlier <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> not filming {{with live}} {{ammunition}} {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E
500|$|On 3 January 1531, Mary's older brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, {{requested}} that she assume the regency of the Netherlands. Charles was ruling a vast empire and was constantly {{in need of}} reliable family members who could govern his remote territories in his name. Mary reluctantly accepted <b>on</b> Charles' <b>insistence.</b> [...] <b>On</b> 6 October 1537, in Monzón, the Emperor wrote to her: ...|$|R
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Pine Island, New York, Kosuga owned a 5000 acre black dirt farm where he grew onions, celery, and lettuce. His {{customers}} included the U.S. Army and Campbell's soup. He also began trading wheat futures. After an unsuccessful stint trading {{in which he was}} brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Kosuga withdrew from commodity trading and at his wife's <b>insistence</b> focused <b>on</b> farming full-time.|$|R
60|$|He was {{so anxious}} to proceed {{that he would have}} made no excuse, {{although}} he saw that he might find himself in a very difficult position. Pete's <b>insistence,</b> therefore, <b>on</b> taking all expenses upon himself, was a considerable relief to him; for although determined to go, he had had an uneasy consciousness that it was a foolish step. He therefore expressed his warm thanks.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 Kallman {{ended their}} sexual {{relationship}} {{because he could}} not accept Auden's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> mutual fidelity, but he and Auden remained companions for the rest of Auden's life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden's death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.|$|E
5|$|In late 1954 {{and early}} 1955 Richardson {{and his wife}} toured Australia {{together}} with Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, playing Terence Rattigan's plays The Sleeping Prince and Separate Tables. The following year he worked with Olivier again, playing Buckingham to Olivier's Richard in the 1955 film of Richard III. Olivier, who directed, was exasperated at his old friend's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> playing the role sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association {{had been}} criticised for its <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> {{the use of}} a {{religious}} promise, leading to the introduction of an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise. This change making the organisation entirely non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, and religion (or lack thereof).|$|E
5000|$|... 1646 - Mutiny by the {{settlers}} when Ramaka's family made the colony's stores their own. Pronis was held captive for 6 months, only released at the <b>insistence</b> of those <b>on</b> a passing Societe ship.|$|R
2500|$|Iglesias {{generally}} {{refers to}} the song as simply [...] "Do You Know?", as it was his record label's <b>insistence</b> to add <b>on</b> [...] "The Ping Pong Song" [...] in parentheses {{to make it more}} distinctive and marketable.|$|R
50|$|According to declassified {{documents}} obtained by the Associated Press, U.S. commanders repeatedly ordered refugees from South Korea shot. While the most famous example of this policy remains the No Gun Ri Massacre, another incident, on 1 September 1950, has been confirmed by the declassified official diary of De Haven. It states that the Navy destroyer, at Army <b>insistence,</b> fired <b>on</b> a seaside refugee encampment at Pohang, South Korea. Survivors say 100 to 200 people were killed.|$|R
5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, clarity and {{precision}} and its <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot's 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in D. H. Lawrence's animal and flower pieces. The rejection of conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E
5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking {{that while}} [...] "Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight" [...] and that Smith's fans [...] "will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography." [...] PopMatters cited that Nugent [...] "fails {{on a very}} basic level to discriminate between his privilege as a fan of Smith's unforgettable music and his responsibilities as a journalist writing an objective study of Smith's life" [...] and the book [...] "is murky, indistinct and woefully incomplete." [...] CNN said in their mixed review that [...] "Nugent sometimes gets a little too insider-y—too many details about too many '90s indie bands—and his <b>insistences</b> <b>on</b> Smith's sense of humor, though no doubt true, ring hollow." [...] Many of the book's detractors complained about the absence of original testimony from Smith's family and close friends such as Joanna Bolme, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss. Ironically, many of his close friends granted interviews for the December 2004 issue of SPIN just as Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing was sent to print.|$|R
5000|$|Following this, the {{relationship}} between Myshkin and Aglaya effectively ends, and in the book's concluding chapters the narrative focus returns to the first triangle. Nastasya Filippovna and Myshkin become engaged, at her <b>insistence,</b> but <b>on</b> {{the day of the}} wedding she again flees to Rogozhin. In so doing, she abandons once and for all any hope of finally accepting herself, and effectively signs her own death warrant. According to Bakhtin, for Nastasya Filippovna [...] "Rogozhin means the knife, and she knows it." ...|$|R
50|$|Christian Wolff redefined {{philosophy}} as {{the science of}} the possible, and applied it in a comprehensive survey of human knowledge to the disciplines of his time. Wolffian philosophy has a marked <b>insistence</b> everywhere <b>on</b> a clear and methodic exposition, holding confidence {{in the power of}} reason to reduce all subjects to this form. He was distinguished for writing copies in both Latin and German. Wolff's teachings held virtually undisputed sway in Germany till the Kantian revolution, and even after that, Wolff continued to be {{regarded as one of the}} most important philosophers from German-speaking lands.|$|R
5|$|Dowding's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> {{waiting for}} AI led {{directly}} to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E
5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} most {{exciting}} and challenging in the field of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
25|$|The Brigadier {{fears the}} Nestenes will return {{and asks for}} the Doctor's help. The Doctor agrees to join UNIT in {{exchange}} for facilities to help repair the TARDIS and a car like the sporty antique roadster he commandeered during the adventure. At his <b>insistence,</b> Liz stays <b>on</b> as his assistant.|$|R
50|$|<b>On</b> <b>insistence</b> of Akali leaders, Kapur Singh {{joined the}} Akali politics. In 1962, {{he was elected}} to the 3rd Lok Sabha as a {{candidate}} of the Swatantra Party from the Ludhiana constituency. In 1969 Kapur Singh was elected to the Vidhan Sabha in the new Punjab state. He also remained the National Professor of Sikhism.|$|R
50|$|Joe Keery {{grew up in}} Newburyport, Massachusetts {{where he}} {{attended}} Newburyport High School. He is the second of five children and grew up surrounded by sisters. He began acting in high school, performing there initially at his sister's <b>insistence.</b> Keery went <b>on</b> to study at The Theatre School at DePaul University and graduated in 2014.|$|R
5|$|In 1886, Black Allan (later {{known as}} Allan F-1) was born. By the {{stallion}} Allendorf (from the Hambletonian family of Standardbreds) {{and out of}} a Morgan mare named Maggie Marshall, he became the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. A failure as a trotting horse, due to his <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> pacing, he was instead used for breeding. From his line, a foal named Roan Allen was born in 1904. Able to perform several ambling gaits, Roan Allen became a successful show horse, and in turn sired several famous Tennessee Walking Horses.|$|E
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E
5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's <b>insistence</b> <b>on</b> letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E
50|$|During {{his year}} and a half at OFK Titograd he {{occasionally}} made appearances with the full squad, but mostly played in the youth setup. In January 1983 at the age of 16, he transferred across town to the more established top-tier league club FK Budućnost <b>on</b> <b>insistence</b> of their head coach at the time Milutin Folić.|$|R
50|$|She {{got married}} to a businessman, Velayudhan Nair in 1966 and quit acting in films. Her husband was the CEO of Sudarshan trading company and a movie producer. The couple have a {{daughter}} Hemalatha (born 1967). Later <b>on</b> <b>insistence</b> of Arrurdas, she started working in films from 1969 to present. Velayudhan died on 26 March 2016 aged 82.|$|R
50|$|Following severe {{conflicts}} with Florian the Gauleiter of Düsseldorf Ripke was {{excluded from the}} NSDAP on November 9, 1932. After being re-admitted to the NSDAP {{for a short time}} in May 1934 Ripke was once again relegated at the <b>insistence</b> of Florian. <b>On</b> a regional level he was however, allowed to re-enter politics as a municipal deputy of the Municipal Assembly of Wuppertal.|$|R
