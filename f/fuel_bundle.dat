25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle.</b> The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the fission {{neutrons}} are thoroughly slowed down {{before they reach}} another fuel rod, meaning that it takes neutrons a longer time to get {{from one part of}} the reactor to the other. Thus if the chain reaction accelerates in one section of the reactor, the change will propagate itself only slowly {{to the rest of the}} core, giving time to respond in an emergency. The independence of the neutrons' energies from the nuclear fuel used is what allows for such fuel flexibility in a CANDU reactor, since every <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> will experience the same environment and affect its neighbors in the same way, whether the fissile material is uranium-235, uranium-233 or plutonium.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E

A 220 MW PHWR <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> contains 15.2 kg of natural uranium dioxide (UO2). Uranium dioxide pellets, which generate heat while undergoing fission, also generate fission products.

25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles</b> increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles,</b> they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{safeguards}} inspection, various nondestructive test {{techniques are}} used. For a long time, nondestructive assay based on radiation measurement such as gamma and neutron measurement {{have been used}} for nuclear material verification. However, due to physical access and radiological environment restrictions in verifying nuclear material, other nondestructive testing techniques are used for safeguards inspection purposes. At Wolsong nuclear power plants, spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles</b> are stored at spent fuel storage bay. Typically, tens of thousands of spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles</b> are densely stored under water. For safeguards inspection, those bundles are item counted, identified by serial numbers, and verified by nondestructive assay. In doing these activities, underwater camera and gamma radiation detectors are being used. However, due to narrow space between bundles and high radiation area, some of bundles are inaccessible. Recently, to overcome those restriction, ultrasonic and microwave techniques are introduced. Although laboratory test was successful, field test at Wolsong nuclear power plants showed that further development is necessary...|$|R

In this literature, the effects of diameter and volume fraction of nanoparticles on thermo-hydraulic parameters are studied. To perform correct calculation, different grid qualities of <b>fuel</b> rod <b>bundle</b> are studied and results are compared with reference results.
