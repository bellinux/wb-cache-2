50|$|Vasa {{might not}} have sunk on 10 August 1628, if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with {{multiple}} tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason, the gunport lids are made with a <b>double</b> <b>lip</b> {{which is designed to}} seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, Vasa {{might not have}} sunk on that day.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} extend the {{effective}} use of cold-formed steel in building applications, a pilot study of eight tests with three different connection configurations in {{both internal and external}} beam-column sub-frames were carried out by Wong and Chung (2000) and the basic configuration of bolted moment connections between <b>double</b> <b>lipped</b> C-sections was established. The present paper reports an extension of the experimental investigation of cold-formed steel internal and external beam-column sub-frames under both gravity and lateral loads. It aims to establish the high structural performance of bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members in practical member orientations. A total of eight beam-column sub-frames with different connection configurations were carried out. It was found that the maximum moment resistances of the proposed bolted moment connections was over 90 % of the moment capacities of the connected members, demonstrating high structural efficiency of bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel sections...|$|R
30|$|Lightweight steel {{structures}} offer an interesting alternative to more traditional construction technologies, especially for low and medium rise residential and office buildings (Casafont et al. 2006) due to some considerable advantages {{such as high}} strength-to-weight ratio, reduced labor costs, fast erection, and economical transportation due to the light weight of cold-formed members (Ebadi Tabrizi and Vosoughifar 2011; Yu and LaBoube 2010; Zaharia and Dubina 2006). Cold-formed steel sections had been considered as secondary structural members such as purlins to support roof cladding (Chung and Lau 1999). Since 1990, {{there has been a}} growing tendency to utilize cold-formed steel as structural members in buildings in a variety of countries such as USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan (Ebadi Tabrizi and Vosoughifar 2011; Wong and Chung 2002). The most common cold-formed steel sections are lipped C sections and lipped Z sections, and the thickness typically ranges from 1.2 to 3.2 mm. Common yield strengths are 280 and 350 N/mm 2 (Chung and Lau 1999; Wong and Chung 2002). Moreover, there is a whole range of variants of these basic shapes, including sections with single and <b>double</b> <b>lips</b> and sections with internal stiffeners (Chung and Lau 1999). Furthermore, welds, screws, and steel bolts are used as connector for these sections (AISI 2008; Pedreschi et al. 1998).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a thorough investigation}} into the structural performance of cold-formed steel column bases using <b>double</b> <b>lipped</b> C sections with bolted moment connections. A total of four column base tests with different connection configurations were carried out, and {{it was found that}} section failure under combined bending and shear was always critical. Moreover, the proposed column bases were demonstrated to be structurally efficient attaining moment resistances close to those of the connected sections. In order to examine the structural behaviour of the column base connections, a finite element model was established using shell and spring elements to model the sections and the bolted fastenings respectively. Both material and geometrical non-linearities were incorporated, and comparison between the test and the numerical results was presented in details. The design rules originally developed for bolted moment connections between lapped Z sections were adopted and re-formulated for the design of column base connections after careful calibration against the test data. Comparison on co-existing moments and shear forces at the critical cross-sections of the column bases was fully presented. It was shown that the proposed design and analysis method was structurally adequate to predict the failure loads under combined bending and shear for column bases with similar connection configurations.

40|$|AbstractCongenital <b>double</b> <b>lip</b> {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} anomaly {{which usually}} involves the upper lip more than the lower lip. It may occur in isolation or {{as a part of}} Ascher’s syndrome. Sometimes upper and lower double lips occur simultaneously. The occurrence of <b>double</b> <b>lip</b> may result in facial deformity especially when the patient attempts to talk, smile or even show the teeth. It may also interfere with speech or mastication. Although surgery may be undertaken to facilitate speech and mastication, the majority of cases are operated for cosmetic reasons. A case of congenital double upper lip, which was surgically treated after orthodontic treatment, for cosmetic reasons, is reported. The different surgical approaches to the management of double upper lip are reviewed with a note on timing of surgery in patients who have concurrent orthodontic or prosthodontic problems.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with the promote of Industrial Building System (IBS) in Malaysia building construction, precast units such as slab, beam and column were widely used. This paper reports on {{the determination of the}} effective cross sectional area of the proposed cold-formed sections that embedded in precast concrete slab. The cold-formed steel sections are single and <b>double</b> <b>lipped</b> channel section, with 100 mm in depth, 50 mm width, 12 mm lips length and 1. 55 mm thickness. In order to determine the flexural capacity of the composite slab system, it is necessary to identify the effective cross sectional area of the section contributes to load-carrying of the slab system. The calculation method was based on the effective width method concept from BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 5. Four types of cold-formed steel frame profiles that embedded in the concrete to form a new type of composite slab system were used to study in this paper. The four types of cold-formed steel section configuration are S 1 -SV, S 2 -SH, S 3 -DV and S 4 -DH. From the analytical calculation, S 3 -DV has the highest effective cross-sectional area, which it only consists of 2 % ineffective area for load-carry capacity. Besides that, single lipped section S 2 -SH fully utilized the cross sectional in carrying load. It can be concluded that S 3 -DV is predicted to have highest bending resistance than other three types of configuration with condition that the reliability of the prediction need to verify as other factors such as shear bonding and shifted neutral axis happened due to combination of concrete and cold-formed section which, will also contribute the strength capacity of the composite slab system...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Lip pits are unusual {{congenital}} anomalies {{affecting the}} lip, first described by DeMurquay in 1845. Lip pits can encounter aesthetic problem thus the patient ask for surgical overcome. Case Report : A 4 -year-old girl patient came with <b>double</b> lower <b>lip</b> pits that present since birth with bilateral cleft lip and palate. The pits made a mucous accumulation occurs during mealtimes and crying, and felt aesthethic discomfort. The surgery {{was performed by}} simple excision combined with split-lip advancement technique under general anaesthesia and the excised pits was then analized for histopatological structures. The patient has no aesthetic defect after surgery. Discussion : Congenital lip pits are developmental anomalies that occur as an isolated defect or either in association with other developmental disturbances. It happens due to notching of lip {{at an early stage}} of development with fixation of tissues of the base of the notch or from a failure of complete union of embryonic lateral sulci of the lip. Lip pits can be shallow or deep, and may be associated with accessory salivary glands. The treatment is usually surgical excision with removal of entire fistulous tract. Conclusion : Surgical removal of lip pits is commonly for cosmetic purpose. It must be treated wisely because lips are essential part of someones face...|$|R

40|$|Reciprocating rod seals {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} systems to prevent the hydraulic fluid from leaking into and polluting the environment. In this research an elastohydrodynamic model of a generalized reciprocating hydraulic rod seal, including mixed lubrication and surface roughness, has been successfully developed. This model consists of coupled fluid mechanics, contact mechanics, thermal analysis and deformation analyses. Such model is capable of predicting the key seal performance characteristics, especially net leakage and friction force. This allows evaluation of potential seal designs and serves as design tools. Also as this model has been developed, the basic physics of seal operation has been clarified, which stimulates the development of innovative seal concepts, such as seals with engineered sealing surfaces. The {{results of this study}} indicate that in general, hydraulic rod seals operate in the mixed lubrication regime, although under certain conditions full film lubrication may occur over a portion of the sealing zone. The roughness of the seal surface and the rod speeds play important roles in determining whether or not a seal will leak. Cavitation during the outstroke and partial full film lubrication during the instroke tend to prevent net leakage. The behavior of a reciprocating hydraulic rod seal with a <b>double</b> <b>lip</b> or two seals in tandem arrangement can be very different from that of a similar seal with a single lip. For the <b>double</b> <b>lip</b> seal, the secondary lip can strongly affect the behavior of the primary lip by producing an elevated pressure in the interlip region. The same seal characteristics that promote effective sealing in a single lip seal and, in addition structural decoupling of multiple lips, are found to promote effective sealing in a multiple lip seal. The model is validated through comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements and observations by industry partners. The results have shown the predicted leakage and friction force for various seal and operation conditions are consistent with the measurements. A seal with micro-pattern on the sealing surface also has been investigated. The results indicate that an elaborately designed pattern can improve the sealing characteristics of the seal, without significantly affecting the friction force. In the end, the selection of the rod seal for a specific application using this analytical model is demonstrated. The best design can be picked up before a prototype being built. Ph. D.

30|$|The use of cold-formed steel (CFS) {{members in}} {{building}} construction {{began in the}} 1850 s in both the United States and Great Britain. In the 1920 s and 1930 s, acceptance of CFS as a construction material was still limited {{because there was no}} adequate design standard and limited information on material use in building codes. One of the first documented uses of CFS as a building material is the Virginia Baptist Hospital (Chen 2010), constructed around 1925 in Lynchburg, Virginia. The walls were load bearing masonry, but the floor system was framed with <b>double</b> back-to-back CFS <b>lipped</b> channels. According to Chuck Greene, P.E of Nolen Frisa Associates (Zhao et al. 2005), the joists were adequate to carry the initial loads and spans, based on current analysis techniques. Greece engineered a recent renovation to the structure and said that for the most part, the joists are still performing well. A site observation during this renovation confirmed that “these joists from the ‘roaring twenties’ are still supporting loads, over 80  years later!” In the 1940 s, Lustron Homes built and sold almost 2, 500 steel-framed homes, with the framing, finishes, cabinets and furniture made from CFS.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Adjustment to {{cleft lip}} and/or palate (CL/P) is multifaceted, {{involving}} several domains of {{psychological and social}} functioning. A substantial increase in {{research in this area}} has been evident in recent years, along with a preliminary shift in how adjustment to CL/P is conceptualised and measured. An updated and comprehensive review of the literature is needed in light of the rapidly expanding and changing field. Design: A narrative review of 148 quantitative and qualitative studies published between January 2004 - July 2015. Main Outcome Measures: Findings are presented according to five key domains of adjustment: Developmental Trajectory, Behaviour, Emotional Wellbeing, Social Experiences and Satisfaction with Appearance and Treatment. Data pertaining to General Psychological Wellbeing were also examined. Results: The overall impact of CL/P on psychological adjustment appears to be low. Nonetheless, the review demonstrates the complexity of findings both within and across domains, and highlights recurring methodological challenges. Conclusions: Research findings from the last decade are considered to be largely inconclusive, although some areas of emerging consensus and improvements in the approaches used were identified. Efforts to collect data from large, representative and longitudinal samples, which are comparable across studies and encompassing of the patient perspective, should be <b>doubled.</b> Keywords: cleft <b>lip</b> and palate, development, behaviour, emotional, social, treatment, quality of lif...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} and categorize the various lip vermilion morphological traits, prevalence, and associations present in a 15 -year-old population The instrument we developed was checked for the reliability of assessment. The study is a cross-sectional study of lip vermilion morphology in 2, 246 fifteen-year-old children. Three-dimensional surface laser scans were taken of the children, and a classification scale was derived and assessed for intra- and inter-reliability. The prevalence of lip vermilion morphological traits and associations was identified. Certain features are found to be likely to be associated with each other: thin philtrum and smooth/deep indentation of the philtrum; wide philtrum and smooth/normal gradient, flat/absent Cupid's bow and smooth/normal/indentation near nose, V-shaped Cupid's bow and indentation in middle/deep groove; thin upper lip vermilion and deep groove; thick upper lip vermilion and smooth philtrum; acute nasolabial angle and upper <b>lip</b> <b>double</b> border and thick upper lip vermilion; obtuse nasolabial angle and thin upper lip vermilion. In conclusion, we present a new method to identify the various morphological features of the vermilion of the lips. The prevalence of morphological traits has been identified in this 15 -year-old population. In addition, the association of lip traits has been reported. This classification scale may be utilized to ascertain prevalence of features amongst other ethnic groups, to gain knowledge of what is considered to be attractive features, and to determine genotype/phenotype associations...|$|R
