40|$|Although <b>geographic</b> <b>features,</b> such as {{mountains}} and coastlines, are fractal, {{some studies have}} claimed that the fractal property is not universal. This claim, which is dubious, is mainly attributed to the strict definition of fractal dimension as a measure or index for characterizing the complexity of fractals. In this article, we propose an alternative, ht-index, to quantify the fractal or scaling structure of <b>geographic</b> <b>features.</b> A <b>geographic</b> <b>feature</b> has ht-index (h) if the pattern of far more small things than large ones recurs (h â€“ 1) times at different scales. The higher the ht-index, the more complex the <b>geographic</b> <b>feature.</b> We conduct three case studies to illustrate how the computed ht-indexes capture the complexity of different <b>geographic</b> <b>features.</b> We further discuss how ht-index is complementary to fractal dimension and elaborate on a dynamic view behind ht-index that enables better understanding of geographic forms and processes...|$|R
