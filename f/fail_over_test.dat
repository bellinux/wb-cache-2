5000|$|Some {{types of}} modern land mines are {{designed}} to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert {{after a period of}} weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of friendly casualties during the conflict or civilian casualties after the conflict's end. The Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), amended in 1996, requires that anti-personnel land mines deactivate and self-destruct, and sets standards for both. [...] Land mines currently used by the United States military {{are designed to}} self-destruct between 4 hours and 15 days depending upon the type. [...] The land mines have a battery and when the battery dies, the land mine self-destructs. [...] The self-destruct system never <b>failed</b> in <b>over</b> 67,000 <b>tested</b> land mines in a variety of conditions. [...] Not all self-destruct mechanisms are absolutely reliable, and most land mines that have been laid throughout history are not equipped to self-destruct. Land mines can also be designed to self-deactivate, for instance by a battery running out of a charge, but deactivation is considered a different mechanism from self-destruction.|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} factors which affect the {{performance}} of a drum closure during drop tests. Important test conditions are: weight of package, height of drop, and angle of impact. Structural characteristics of the package determine its ability to withstand the test conditions imposed. These characteristics include: package diameter, shell material and thickness, strength of internal fill material (e. g., fiberboard), and configuration of closure (clamp-ring, bolted flange, etc.). For the clamp-ring closure configuration a study of published drop test results has shown that packages having a weight ratio of less than 50 per cent were typically able to retain their lids in hypothetical accident condition, 30 -ft drop tests. Those having weight ratios greater than 50 per cent typically <b>failed.</b> Prior <b>testing</b> <b>over</b> the integrity of the clamp-ring closure, consistently demonstrated that the clamp-ring is unable to retain the drum lid in thirty foot drop tests of packages containing the maximum allowed weight (640 lb), which confirms the previous studies. To determine if the clamp-ring closure is adequate for packages with lower weight contents, a series of tests were performed on packages weighing around 325 lb (i. e., a typical shipping weight for DOE packages) at a range of impact angles as detailed in this report. The test results consistently demonstrated that the standard clamp-ring closure is unable to retain the drum lid of standard 6 M packages weighing 325 lb...|$|R
