40|$|Large {{static strain}} {{appears on the}} fillet on upper deck of diesel engine {{cylinder}} block by tightening force of cylinder head bolts. Reducing static strain is necessary to avoid the crack initiation on the fillet. The static strain along the fillet can be reduced, for example, by modifying the depth of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement,</b> and modifying the bead shape and position into the bore grommet of cylinder head gasket. In the present study, the depth of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> was optimized considering four conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, the circumferential fluctuation of strain, the change rate of strain against the depth of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement,</b> {{and the length of}} cylinder head bolt. The bead shape or position was optimized considering two conditions, the overall magnitude of strain, and the distribution of contact pressure on the contact area with the cylinder block and the cylinder liner. The analysis results of the circumferential distribution of static strain were agreed with the measurement results. The optimum depth of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> of cylinder head bolt and the optimum type of the cylinder head gasket were evaluated using FEM...|$|R

5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with <b>threads</b> for full <b>engagement</b> of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater <b>in</b> the <b>threads</b> than <b>in</b> the shank.|$|R

40|$|Multilayer {{techniques}} such as: tape wrapping, braiding, and filament winding represent versatile and economical routes for fabricating composite tubes and cylindrical structures. However, multilayer architectures lack the radial reinforcement required to retain threads when the desired means of connection or closure is a threaded joint. This issue was {{addressed in the}} development of a filament wound, carbon-carbon composite impact shell for the NASA radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The problem of poor thread shear strength was solved by incorporating a number of radial elements of triangular geometry around the circumference of the thread for the full length of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement.</b> The radial elements significantly increased the shear strength of the threaded joint by transmitting the applied force to the balance of composite structure. This approach is also applicable to ceramic composites...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to define torque values for bolts and screws when loading is not a concern. Fasteners require a certain torque to fulfill its function and prevent failure. NASA Glenn Research Center {{did not have a}} set of fastener torque tables for non-critical applications without loads, usually referring to hand-tight or wrench-tight torqueing. The project is based on two formulas, torque and pullout load. Torque values are calculated giving way to preliminary data tables. Testing is done to various bolts and metal plates, torqueing them until the point of failure. Around 640 torque tables were developed for UNC, UNF, and M fasteners. Different lengths of <b>thread</b> <b>engagement</b> were analyzed for the 5 most common materials used at GRC. The tables were put together in an Excel spreadsheet and then formatted into a Word document. The plan is to later convert this to an official technical publication or memorandum...|$|R
