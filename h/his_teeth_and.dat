5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything with his left hand, including brushing <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mazurkiewicz wrote {{a letter}} to Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security, {{complaining}} of the continued persecution of former Home Army soldiers and he was arrested again. During a two-year pre-trial confinement, Mazurkiewicz was interrogated and tortured—he was beaten and <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> hair were forcibly pulled out. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in a show trial, in which the prosecutor submitted a false confession allegedly made by Mazurkiewicz and no defense witnesses were allowed to appear. He remained imprisoned until the amnesty of 1956. Eventually rehabilitated, he was active in organizations which sought to protect former veterans of anti-Nazi resistance and served as vice-president of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, the Polish veterans association. In 1980, during a brief liberalization associated with the first Solidarity period he was promoted to the rank of General.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, four teens {{allegedly}} {{obsessed with}} Grand Theft Auto IV {{went on a}} crime spree after being in New Hyde Park, New York. They first robbed a man, knocking out <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> then they stopped a woman driving a black BMW and stole her car and her cigarettes.|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise {{had a good}} {{relationship}} with her son, so that by the time of his coming of age in 1729, she was invited to take equal part in the celebrations. In his youth, she sent him daily letters reminding him to do such things as brush <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> get plenty of sleep; he duly responded to each letter patiently.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 when World War I broke out, {{a return}} to the Congo became {{impossible}} as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for {{a return to}} his homeland faded. On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> shot himself in the heart with a stolen pistol.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, {{construction}} worker Martiros Demerchyan {{claimed that he}} was tortured by Sochi police. Demerchyan, who spent seven weeks constructing housing for the 2014 Winter Olympics, was accused by his supervisor of stealing wiring. Demerchyan denied the allegations but when the victim returned to work to collect his pay, he was met by several police officers who beat him, breaking two of <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> sexually assaulted him with a crow bar. He was treated in hospital, but doctors told his family they had found no serious injuries on his body.|$|E
25|$|Once, {{after signing}} a {{long-term}} deal with Warner Bros., Bogart had predicted with glee that <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> hair would fall {{out before the}} contract ended. By 1955, though he was well established as an independent producer, the sometime actor's health was failing. In the wake of Santana Productions he had formed a new company and had anxious plans for a film, Melville Goodwin, U.S.A., {{in which he would}} play a General and Bacall a press magnate. However, his persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore and he dropped the project.|$|E

25|$|After {{his captors}} departed, he freed himself by chewing through the ropes with <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> {{made his way}} through the miles of jungle to American lines. Before {{accepting}} medical attention from Lt. Col. Stanley Radzyminski MD, he gasped a warning to Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock, whose 2nd Battalion 1st Marines held the defences at the Ilu River mouth. Vouza told him that an estimated 250 to 500 Japanese soldiers were coming to attack his position in any minute. This warning gave the Marines brief but precious time of about 10 minutes to prepare their defences along the Ilu river. The subsequent Battle of the Tenaru was a clear victory for the Marines.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{learns that}} Django {{is waiting for}} him at Tombstone Cemetery and kills Nathaniel, but not before the latter hides María. Django, resting himself {{on the back of}} Mercedes Zaro’s cross, pulls the trigger guard off his {{revolver}} with <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> rests it against the cross, just as Jackson’s gang arrive. Believing that Django cannot make {{the sign of the cross}} with his mutilated hands, Jackson shoots the corners of Zaro's cross. Django then kills Jackson and his men by pushing the trigger against the cross and repeatedly pulling back the hammer. Leaving his pistol on Zaro’s cross, Django staggers out of the cemetery, ready to start a new life with María.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E

25|$|Two other Italians wrote rather {{different}} works that centre on the animal within the human. One was Niccolò Machiavelli in his unfinished long poem, L'asino d'oro (The golden ass, 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe’s herd of beasts. After spending {{a night of}} love with him, she explains {{the characteristics of the}} animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop’s lion in love that allowed himself to be deprived of <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, {{does not want to be}} changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
500|$|After {{about the}} age of fifty, James {{suffered}} increasingly from arthritis, gout and kidney stones. He also lost <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> drank heavily. The King was often seriously ill during {{the last year of his}} life, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure, rarely able to visit London, while Buckingham consolidated his control of Charles to ensure his own future. One theory is that James may have suffered from porphyria, a disease of which his descendant George III of the United Kingdom exhibited some symptoms. James described his urine to physician Théodore de Mayerne as being the [...] "dark red colour of Alicante wine". The theory is dismissed by some experts, particularly in James's case, because he had kidney stones which can lead to blood in the urine, colouring it red.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Tod {{got to the}} tree, {{he found}} that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> He chewed <b>and</b> gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> out, <b>and</b> quite knocked him over backwards.|$|R

500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E
500|$|When Andronikos arrived, {{he found}} that his {{authority}} was overthrown: Isaac had been proclaimed emperor. The deposed Emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but was captured. Isaac handed {{him over to the}} city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment. His right hand was cut off, <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face. At last, led to the Hippodrome of Constantinople, he was hung up by the feet between two pillars, and two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply. He died on September 12, 1185. [...] At the news of the emperor's death, his son and co-emperor, John, was murdered by his own troops in Thrace.|$|E
500|$|The Shaktisamgama Tantra {{says that}} Dhumavati can be worshipped for the Uchhatana (eradication) of a person. A worshipper should imagine {{the world as}} well as the goddess's mantra as grey. He should blacken <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> wear black clothes and observe regulations, such as eating little, {{sleeping}} on the ground, and subduing his senses. In this worship procedure called kakakarma (crow-procedure), he should [...] "transform his mind into a crow" [...] by which one can cause harm to a person. Another Tantric text mentions the worshipper should burn a crow in a cremation flame and, while repeating the goddesses' mantra, spread the ashes in the enemy's house, which will lead to his destruction. The text further says Dhumavati should be worshipped only by Dakshinamarga ("right-handed path"). While the Kalarudra-tantra says Dhumavati can be worshipped for destructive purposes, Shakta-pramoda relates that her worship is useful to acquire siddhi to destroy one's foes.|$|E
