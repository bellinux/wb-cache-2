40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to design a {{dielectric}} covered <b>discone</b> WLAN <b>antenna</b> working under the protocols of IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g/n. It has the wideband operation of <b>discone</b> <b>antennas</b> and the compact dimensions of dielectric resonator antennas which {{is compatible with the}} latest main protocol WLAN applications. This antenna has an ultra-wide bandwidth (2. 25 GHz- 6. 0 GHz), which is sufficient for the data communication protocols of IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g/n (2401 MHz- 2484 MHz and 5150 MHz- 5825 MHz). Its directivity is 3. 1 dBi at the lower frequency band and 5. 3 dBi at the higher frequency band, which is enough to cover conventional indoor usages. In order to use similar radiation patterns at both operational bands the quad slot is added to the disk. The antenna is quite competitive compared to other commercially used antennas because of its wideband potential: it can be is used not only in WLAN applications, but also for other ultra-wideband applications.

40|$|An Ultra-Wideband (UWB) antenna is {{required}} for UWB communications systems, such as the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). In this case, the desired antenna must cover a bandwidth of 20 MHz to 4 GHz, be omnidirectional, be convenient to transport and deploy, {{and be able to}} transmit 200 Watts of power. Conventional <b>discone</b> <b>antennas</b> are candidates for such systems, but they have insufficient bandwidth for the required application. To improve their bandwidth, we added resistive loading to the conical elements and to the ground plane, and we increased the size of the ground plane. We built several models of the resistively loaded discone, and we observed a dramatic reduction in VSWR when compared to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) discone. We also simulated the antenna pattern using the NEC computer code, and we used the antenna with an amateur radio. The resistively loaded discone has clear advantages for UWB communications when compared to the COTS discone. Table of Content...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Traditional design {{guidelines}} for broadband antennas {{do not always}} produce satisfactory performance for the desired frequency range of interest. In addition, the accurate prediction of the freespace antenna performance {{is not sufficient to}} determine if the antenna will meet a larger system requirement because the performance of the antenna can change significantly when it is installed on a platform. Antenna design software, such as WIPL-D, addresses the difficulties of designing antennas with broadband performance by providing optimization software that can automatically resize the various antenna dimensions until a desired performance criterion is met. At high-frequencies, the electrically large size of the platform makes it computationally difficult, or impossible, to directly consider the interactions between the antenna and the platform when designing the antenna in a full-wave solver. This paper describes an approach for the design and optimization of a <b>discone</b> <b>antenna</b> and then the subsequent installation on a large commercial aircraft. The antenna design will be optimized across a wide frequency range using WIPL-D Optimizer. The resulting <b>discone</b> <b>antenna</b> design is then imported into Savant-Hybrid, a hybrid asymptotic and full-wave solver, and the installed antenna performance is simulated using GPU acceleration at multiple potential antenna locations to determine the location that provides the least-degraded installed antenna performance.

40|$|Multi-static {{transmitter}} {{networks are}} found in the digital broadcast service nets for radio (DAB) and television (DVB-T) with bandwidths ranging from 1. 5 to 7 MHz and transmit powers between 1 and 10 kW. Taking advantage of these transmitter networks for radar purposes combines the covertness of a hardly locatable receiver with the advantageous anti-stealth detection capabilities of the VHF/UHF frequency range and the simultaneous multi-static illumination under different aspect angles. Increased multi-static coverage at low elevations and diffraction propagation add to the detection of low flying objects. Passive, multi-static, low frequency radars are thus expected to have decisive potentials to detect stealth and low flying targets.

Doppler shift of 1420. 4 MHz for different radio sources were observed to determine their dynamics. By measuring the Doppler shift, the velocity V, of each radio source can be determined. Hence the dynamic of radio source can be deduced. The radio spectrum of Coma Cluster was also analyzed and its dark matter content was estimated.

It was successfully concluded that longer observation time improves spectrum detection of weak radio sources. The observations of neutral hydrogen emission line were interfaced by man-made radio frequencies from unknown sources. This type of radio frequency is called Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).

The survey was conducted during business hours {{from the roof of}} the Ohio State University ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL), using two antennas. One antenna was a commercially available wideband <b>discone</b> <b>antenna,</b> which is weakly directive along the horizon, and has directivity ≪ 1 toward the sky. The other antenna was a planar spiral, which has a complementary pattern (directivity ≪ 1 toward the horizon, weakly directive toward the sky). The resolution of the survey is 1 MHz and the system temperature Tsys ∼ 360 ◦K, resulting in a nominal “snapshot” sensitivity of about − 110 dBm/MHz against an antenna temperature TA ∼ 290 ◦K (i. e., ∆T ∼ 650 ◦K). After 1 hr, ∆T is reduced to about 5. 3 ◦K, allowing detection of signals as weak as − 131 dBm/MHz provided that they are stationary. A “max hold” technique is also used to enhance sensitivity to strong, low-duty cycle signals, such as pulsed-CW radars. The results presented here represent the best characterization of the RFI envirnoment in the ESL area obtained so far. A number of known RFI sources – both strong and weak – are identified, and the presence of weak, impulsive spurious RFI is identified.

40|$|Modem {{telecommunication}} services require increasing data rates for both mobile and fixed applications. At frequencies {{in the range}} 2. 5 GHz to 6 GHz physical constraints {{on the size of}} equipment result in antenna with moderate directivity typically with an antenna beam width of 20 degrees or greater. Thus building and ground clutter is present within the first Fresnel zones of the antenna system which gives rise to multi-path propagation. This multi-path propagation (average delay and RMS delay spread) has been investigated using a wideband FMCW channel sounder that is capable of operation at a number of frequencies. The channel sounder has been based upon a parallel architecture sounder operating within the 2 GHz band with a number of frequency conversion modules to translate operation to the new frequency bands under study. Two primary configurations have been explored. In the first of these, propagation has been measured simultaneously within the 2. 5 GHz, 3. 4 GHz and 5. 7 GHz bands. This is believed to be novel and original. In the second configuration four parallel channels operating within the 5. 7 GHz band may be operated simultaneously. This configuration supports multiple antennas at the receiver. To support the work in the bands from 2. 5 GHz to 6 GHz wideband <b>discone</b> <b>antenna</b> have been designed and fabricated. A system to provide relative gain and phase calibration for up to four antennas has been developed and demonstrated. This is also believed to represent a novel method of performing antenna and array calibration. Finally, the frequency converters have been used in conjunction with additional components to provide an FMCพ sounder operating within the 60 GHz Oxygen absorption band. This work is novel in that up to 1 GHz of spectrum can be swept. To support this work a significant number of microwave components have been designed and developed. In particular a novel wide band balanced X 3 multiplier and a novel impedance-matched amplitude-equaliser (to provide amplifier gain-slope equalisation) has been developed. Channel soundings have been performed at three frequencies simultaneously using band specific and common antenna. The average delay and RMS delay spread have been demonstrated to be essentially frequency independent for the environments evaluated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
