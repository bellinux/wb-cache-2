5|$|On November 23, 1999, Michaels made {{a special}} {{appearance}} for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling at the 10th Anniversary Show pay-per-view at the Yokohama Arena, {{serving as the}} guest referee for the H vs fake Hayabusa main event. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> involved in the match when fake Hayabusa delivered a low blow on him and he responded later on with Sweet Chin Music.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2009, Swagger {{was traded}} to the Raw brand, making his debut as part of a three-on-one {{gauntlet}} match against WWE Champion Randy Orton, in which <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> purposely counted out in order to make an impression on Orton. On the July 13 episode of Raw, he won his first match on the brand by defeating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). He then feuded with MVP for several weeks, culminating at SummerSlam, in a match that MVP won. After his short feud with MVP ended, Swagger began pursuing the United States Championship. He had a title match on September 21 against Kofi Kingston but lost the match by countout after stealing the championship belt and leaving the arena with it but Kingston later took it back while Swagger was in a physical confrontation with The Miz. Swagger made another unsuccessful attempt at the title at Hell in a Cell in a triple threat match against Kingston and The Miz. At the Royal Rumble, Swagger entered at number 26 in the Royal Rumble match, but was later eliminated by Kofi Kingston.|$|E
500|$|Several {{lines from}} the episode were met with {{critical}} praise. Fowler cited Michael's line apologizing for Jesus' birthday being [...] "so lame" [...] as {{the best in the}} episode. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the quotes for the episode. The site ranked Kevin's admission that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> in secret santa, Dwight's declaration that [...] "Yankee Swap" [...] is like [...] "Machiavelli meets Christmas", Michael's explanation about the true meaning of Christmas, and Michael's question about whether or not 15 bottles of vodka is enough [...] "to get 20 people plastered", a five out of five.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into a peck of trouble. That's what I {{want to talk}} to you and Uncle John about," [...] she replied, {{her happy}} face growing as serious as it could ever become.|$|R
6000|$|He {{raised his}} head as old Jolyon came in, and muttered: [...] "How are you, Jolyon? Haven't seen you for an age. You've been to Switzerland, they tell me. This young Bosinney, <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into a mess. I knew how it would be!" [...] He held out the papers, {{regarding}} his elder brother with nervous gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] said Mrs. Hignett. [...] "I never liked him and I dislike him now. <b>He</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into this trouble through his own wrong-headedness." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1994, though, Noda {{had landed}} a Formula One seat. Although his results had not been unimpressive, it was more {{by virtue of the}} {{sponsorship}} money he brought that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into the financially troubled Larrousse team {{towards the end of the}} season. Still a relative unknown on the world stage, though, Noda himself was well aware of the fact that expectations of him were low. As he said himself: [...] "People think I'm useless." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Mirza had not envisaged {{any change}} in his {{previous}} powers; he wanted to retain the ability to maneuver things {{in keeping with his}} own whims. Judging from the situation, the things however had changed as the time and situation both were demanding the complete solution. General Ayub Khan came to an understanding that the real political power rested with the support from the military, and within a week of enforcing the martial law, President Mirza realized the delicate position <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into. In an interview with Dawn, President Mirza regretted his decision saying: [...] "I did not mean to do it" [...] while offering assurances that the martial law would be for the shortest possible duration.|$|E
2500|$|Kouichi Yotsui {{said it was}} he who [...] "pushed for a ninja concept" [...] as {{they were}} leaning towards an action game, a ninja setting would've been convenient. [...] "The hero would be derived from a ninja. We loosely decided on that." [...] Regarding Hiryu's three robot helpers, {{he said that he was}} {{inspired}} by the 1960s ninja comics (the one that most influenced him was Shirato Sanpei's Kamui Gaiden), in which the ninja often had various animals to support them or attack their enemies. Speaking with Retro Gamer, Yotsui said that Strider Hiryu's climbing abilities were inspired by his personal experience when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> stranded on the roof of Capcom’s building; fearing freezing to death and with no way to call for help, he climbed down the side of the building to reach a nearby fire escape stairway.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's comin' back again--he {{had to go}} off {{to another}} place--but I could see 'twa'n't no use," [...] said Elbridge with patient despair; <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> in hand again, and spoke clearly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> up, shook <b>himself,</b> {{and slapped}} {{his arms across his}} breast vigorously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the truth. Tell {{him that}} I am {{remaining}} in the dining-room because I think his task will be easier with you in my absence. <b>He</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into some mess with that woman." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{working at}} the {{aircraft}} plant in Los Angeles, Lane passed the Los Angeles Rams offices on his bus ride to work. He walked into the office with a scrapbook of clippings in 1952 {{and asked for a}} tryout. He was recommended to the Rams by Gabby Sims and signed as a free agent. Lane initially tried out as a receiver, the position he had played at Fort Ord, but was switched to a defensive back by the Rams. In the Rams' first scrimmage on August 3, 1952, Lane drew praise as [...] "the outstanding player in the scrimmage by a country mile" [...] due to his [...] "ferocious" [...] approach to the game and his speed in chasing down Elroy Hirsch. After the scrimmage, Rams head coach Joe Stydahar said, [...] "Lane came out here to make the ball club. Well, last night <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> a job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matsuzaka {{ended the}} season with an 18–3 record, 2.90 ERA and held opponents to a [...]211 batting average (and 6.9 hits-per-9-innings), {{the lowest in the}} majors. He also led the AL by leaving 80.6 percent of the baserunners he allowed stranded. These numbers were enough to place him 4th in the American League Cy Young Award race. However, a major problem for Matsuzaka was the control of his pitches, which, {{combined}} with his lack of innings pitched due to his injury, factored into his Cy Young voting. He walked 94 batters in 167 and 2/3 innings (a major-league-leading 13.1% of all batters he faced), even walking an eye-popping eight in one game against the Detroit Tigers on May 5. [...] Eight times in the 2008 season, Matsuzaka surrendered walks to five or more batters in a game, and 12 times he walked three or more in a game. The interesting statistic is that Matsuzaka was 11–1 in the 16 starts he walked three or more batters, which was a testament to his ability to wiggle out of whatever trouble <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the fourth Test of the series against India in 1962 that Nurse was given another {{opportunity}} at Test level. Nurse was made only one run in the first innings and in the secon innings was 46 not {{out at the end of}} the matchthe West Indies won by 7 wickets. Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the nice things claimed for him. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> out far too often through always being in too big a hurry to get on with the scoring, but in August he looked a very fine player." [...] He was given another opportunity to succeed in the sub-continent with a Commonwealth XI tour of Pakistan in 1963. Nurse scored 369 runs in six matches on tour including 126 not out in the final match against Pakistan at Dacca Stadium.|$|E
6000|$|... “The folks I {{gave him}} letters to {{told me he}} was here in Cuba; but I’m not quite sure his name was Broughton. <b>He</b> had <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> mixed up in some kind of trouble in England.” ...|$|R
50|$|In 1978, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to play <b>himself</b> in Pauline et l'ordinateur, {{directed}} by Francis Fehr.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} we {{received}} the usual insulting communication {{on a sheet}} of Charles's own dainty note. Last time he wrote it was on Craig-Ellachie paper: this time, like the wanton lapwing, <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> another crest.|$|R
60|$|Davis involuntarily shrank away. His {{flesh was}} weak, {{but not so}} his spirit. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{promptly}} in hand and struck another match.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> out of {{the room}} again, and then Marcia, who had made him some embarrassed thanks, burst out in praise of his pleasantness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I don't {{care for}} {{anything}} more," [...] said Frank, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{out of the}} room more inarticulately than he need, Westover thought.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> up, {{disengaging}} <b>himself</b> from her, {{and went}} {{to the other side of}} the room.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{flashback}} in the episode [...] "The Return of Martin Crane", Martin (shortly before being shot) is shown having {{just bought a}} goldfish named [...] "Eddie". His partner suggests that <b>he</b> should've <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> a dog instead, to which Martin responds that he isn't a dog person. Clearly, this changed sometime after <b>he</b> <b>got</b> shot.|$|R
50|$|Ruy and Caesar {{attempt to}} burgle Don Salluste's safe {{and find that}} <b>he</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> locked inside it. They release him, but he is {{immediately}} arrested because in his safe are found some of the Queen's jewels, which he has stolen.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{mixed up}} in a divorce case. I forget the particulars, but I know it was {{something}} very disagreeable. It was among artistic people." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{dismissed}} under {{circumstances of}} peculiar violence, that left a deep impression on Mr. Polly's mind. He wondered {{about it for}} years afterwards, {{trying to get the}} rights of the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not do harm!--Well, I think you'll find {{yourself}} {{of a different}} opinion before a month is gone. What would you say now, if <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> put into the hospital? Would that be harm?" ...|$|E
50|$|Sunaina is devastated when Chandan breaks all {{ties with}} her and holds her {{responsible}} for putting his father’s life in jeopardy.

6000|$|... "Do, please; I feel sure I {{have hit}} upon it. <b>He</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{engaged in a}} hurry to some girl he doesn't really care about, and he is far too much of a gentleman to break it off, though he's in love quite another way with Daphne." ...|$|R
50|$|Jeeves's uncle Charlie Silversmith is butler at Deverill. Bertie Wooster {{has been}} to stay there {{on a couple of}} occasions, but is not a {{particularly}} welcome guest and is usually sent back to London prior to the arranged date of departure, due to some silly scrape <b>he</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> into.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, {{surprised}} at the sudden question. [...] "He's just gone up to the store to buy a shirt and some things. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> splashed trying to push his boat off last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I better," [...] persisted Barker. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> {{somehow to}} the door, where he paused a moment, and {{contrived}} to pant, [...] "Well, good day," [...] and without effort at more cordial leave-taking, passed out.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leland. [...] "He earns his pay, and all I {{did was to}} make it {{a little}} easier for him. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> mixed up with a {{threshing}} mill at another place a while ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little of}} both I fancy," [...] said the Colonel, [...] "but I suspect he is giving me up as a bad job. Ermine, there are ominous revivifications going on at home, and <b>he</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> rigged out in London, and had his hair cut, so that he looks ten years younger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, father; let's {{hear what}} Mr. Keegan has to say.--Well, Mr. Keegan, does he propose giving {{anything}} but what <b>he</b> has <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> already?--or does <b>he</b> propose {{to take the}} estate for the mortgage, and cry quits; so that father, and Feemy, and I, can walk out just where we plaze?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> soon, however, <b>got</b> <b>himself</b> away. When <b>he</b> rose to go Alexandrina also rose, {{and he was}} {{permitted}} to press his nose against her cheekbone {{by way of a}} salute.|$|R
