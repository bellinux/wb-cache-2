40|$|Owing to its skin-sensitizing and fluorochromatic properties, {{fluorescein}} isothiocyanate (FITC) is employed frequently as an experimental hapten in mechanistic studies of contact allergy, {{particularly in the}} context of the role of migration and activation of Langerhans’ cells. In this study we demonstrated that topical exposure of mice to FITC results in the selective development of activated lymph node cells (LNC) expressing a preferential type 2 cytokine-secretion profile, with high levels of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 10, but low levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Negative selection (complement depletion) identified CD 4 + T helper (Th) 2 -type cells as the primary source in activated LNC of the type 2 cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10, whereas the low levels of IFN-γ produced were derived exclusively from CD 8 + T cytotoxic (Tc) 1 -type cells. A biphasic pattern of cutaneous inflammatory reactions was elicited by exposure to FITC, the early phase of which could be transferred passively with serum (presumably immunoglobulin E [IgE] antibody), whereas adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that Th 2 -type CD 4 + cells were responsible for the delayed-type component of the <b>dermal</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction.</b> In contrast with contact allergic reactions induced by other sensitizing haptens, which are considered to be largely Th 1 /Tc 1 -mediated immune processes regulated by Th 2 -type cells, these results suggest therefore that the skin lesions provoked in mice by FITC are primarily a result of the activation of Th 2 -type cells...|$|E
50|$|Trombiculid mites (chiggers) also feed on blood, {{but only}} in the larval stage. The {{life-cycle}} starts with eggs laid in the environment of the normal hosts of the larvae, typically rodents and other small mammals. After the engorged larva molts to a nymph the remaining life-cycle comprises stages that are not parasitic, but free-living. There are several nymphal stages. The adults can be found crawling on vegetation, conspicuous with a dense covering of red setae (similar to hairs). Trombicula autumnalis, the harvest mite, causes severe pruritus to its host after it has detached. Feeding by the larvae involves secretion of a feeding tube, the stylostome, into the host's skin. This remains when the larva detaches and proteins in the secretion induce inflammatory and <b>dermal</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions,</b> with intense pruritus. Domestic birds, dogs and humans are among the other hosts afflicted by this temporary infestation.|$|R
50|$|Sarcoptic mites {{as adults}} are microscopic, nearly {{circular}} in outline, and their legs are short, adapted for burrowing. The females, after mating with males {{on the surface}} of their host's skin, burrow into the living layers of the epidermis (mainly the stratum spinosum). They make tunnels horizontal {{to the surface of the}} skin. Here, eggs are laid and development of larvae and nymphs occurs. The mites have low mobility and transmission between hosts occurs only during close contact. The feeding of the mites and their excretory products irritates and inflames the skin, causing intense pruritus. <b>Dermal</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> develop in the host. Chronic infestations lead to thickening of the skin by overproduction of epidermal cells (acanthosis), resulting in a characteristic depilated and scaly appearance. Stress caused by the pruritus can be severe, and will result in 6% to 23% lost productivity of commercially reared pigs. Camels are prone to severe infestation with Sarcoptes.|$|R

Sarcoptic mites as adults are microscopic, nearly circular in outline, and their legs are short, adapted for burrowing. The females, after mating with males {{on the surface of}} their host's skin, burrow into the living layers of the epidermis (mainly the stratum spinosum).

40|$|Experimental {{induction}} of an intradermal granulomatous <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> in the primarily immunized {{guinea pig}} was studied {{by means of}} tight microscopy {{during the course of}} the immune response. Animals were sensitized to dinitrophenylated human serum albumin (DNP 10 -HSA), and challenged with this antigen covalently linked to Sepharose 2 B beads by the cyanogen bromide reaction. At appropriate intervals, the dermal changes produced by this complex antigen were compared with those produced by DNP 10 -HSA or soluble antigen. Sepharose 2 B beads atone, and DNP 10 -HSA plus Sepharose 2 B in the same animal. The complex antigen produced lesions characteristic of granulomatous hypersensitivity 5 and 11 days beyond the time of the skin test. The others showed the characteristic responses of <b>hypersensitivity,</b> foreign-body <b>reaction,</b> and a mixture of delayed-hypersensitivity and foreign-body reaction, but the intensity of the reactions had diminished by 5 days and had disappeared after 11 days.

40|$|GIN {{parasite}} {{infections are}} a major disease problem in small ruminants. Haemonchus contortus {{is one of the}} most economically important GIN parasites causing global production losses. Anthelmintic drugs are the commonly used control method for most parasitic infections. However, development of widespread resistance to most current anthelmintics suggests alternative controls are needed. Such strategies may include breeding parasite-resistant sheep and the development of effective vaccines. Currently these approaches are limited due to deficits in our understanding of host-parasite relationships. In this thesis research is described which examined the potential role of cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> to measure and better understand the complexity of the sheep immune response to H. contortus. The first question focused on whether cutaneous <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> to intradermal injections using distinct antigens (allergens and bacterial antigens) could predict worm resistance or susceptibility in sheep with known genetic worm resistance status. <b>Hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> were observed to various antigens but their use as a predictive tool for natural resistance in this cohort of sheep appeared limited as there was no correlation with parasitological values. The second aim was to quantify immunological responsiveness to different adjuvants and identify the T 1 and T 2 pathways contributing to their suitability for use with parasite vaccines. This study found that the putative T 2 adjuvant DEAE showed persistence and significant correlations with faecal egg counts (FEC) and various immune parameters. The third aim was to determine whether an efficacious adult sheep vaccine could induce protection in young sheep and determine the immune correlates of the lamb response. This study showed that young vaccinated sheep had significant type 2 parasite specific post-vaccination and post-infection <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions.</b> A lack of a key immune cell in parasite resistance development, the eosinophil response, was inadequate in comparison to adult vaccine experiments suggesting an inability of young sheep to recruit eosinophils, which may play a role in loss of protective efficacy. In conclusion, these studies have demonstrated that cutaneous hypersensitivity responses with relevant antigens are an effective method of studying the inflammatory response against worm infection. They also allowed analysis of the inflammatory effects of adjuvants but were of limited value as a predictive tool for genetic resistance. Thus, it is suggested that further studies relating <b>dermal</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> to host-parasite responses may lead to a better understanding of host-parasite interactions and provide useful and easily measured markers to identify specific immune reactions in vaccinated and infected animals...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Iodinated radio {{contrast}} media {{are among the}} most commonly used drugs administered intravenously. Contrast agents used for radiological examinations can give rise to different types of <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions,</b> therefore it is important for radiological nurses to be prepared and alert for occuring symptoms to provide a safe patient care. Aim: The aim of the literature review was to study the symptoms and frequency of the occuring <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions,</b> and what kinds of patients are mostly at risk for the contrast <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> of radiological examinations with intravenous or intra-arterial administration of iodinated non- ionic contrast agent. Method: The study was conducted as a general literature review in the field of radiography and performed systematically in order to sort out scientific research that could answer the aim. 15 articles were analyzed. Result: The prevalence of <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> was between 0, 1 % and 2, 7 %, severe <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> requiring urgent medical care were 0, 01 %. The most common symptom was urticaria. Several risk factors such as the history of different diseases and allergies, previous {{contrast media}} reactions and female gender were described. Conclusion: <b>Hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> after the administration of iodinated non-ionic contrast media were rare. Regarding risk factors different results were shown, there was no risk factor that stands out more than others. It may be difficult for radiological nurses to feel well prepared and confident in their actions when a severe <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction</b> occurs because the <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> are so rare.
