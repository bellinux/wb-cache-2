5|$|By {{the end of}} 1941, the {{government}} of the Dutch East Indies were concerned that Empire of Japan could invade the colony. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of the film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Union, though already beginning production of a film set in the Majapahit era titled <b>Damar</b> Woelan, was forced to stop filming. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Union was closed, never to reopen.|$|E

25|$|However, Sylvias {{greatest}} {{fight was}} yet to come. On 26 April she sighted three armed brigs and two lug sail vessels near Edam Island (now <b>Damar</b> Besam in Indonesia's Thousand Islands), making all haste towards Batavia.

[...] Reflecting on the way in which everyone went their separate ways, Handlen wrote, [...] "That’s what this finale is about to me. Not the end of the war, or the death of some bad guys, but the reminder that there are so many stories that go on without us." ...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Cardassian leader, <b>Damar</b> (Casey Biggs), {{receives}} {{intelligence about}} the Starfleet movements towards Chin'toka and orders his troops {{to speed up}} the deployment of weapon platforms in the system.

25|$|During Tribhuwana’s rule, the Majapahit kingdom grew {{much larger}} and became {{famous in the}} area. Under the {{initiative}} of her able and ambitious prime minister, Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent its armada to conquer the neighbouring island of Bali. According to the Babad Arya Tabanan manuscript, in 1342 Majapahit forces led by Gajah Mada, assisted by his general Arya <b>Damar,</b> the regent of Palembang, landed in Bali. After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the Bali Kingdom in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until {{the death of her}} mother in 1350. She abdicated the throne in favour of her son, Hayam Wuruk.|$|E
5000|$|In Babylon 5, {{he played}} both Neroon and Mr. Welles. Vickery would {{also make a}} guest {{appearance}} as the latter in the Babylon 5 spin-off, Crusade. His largest Star Trek role was as Rusot, a member of <b>Damar's</b> Cardassian resistance group, appearing in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes [...] "The Changing Face of Evil", [...] "When It Rains…" [...] and [...] "Tacking Into the Wind". He also played a Betazoid in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode [...] "Night Terrors" [...] and a Klingon in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode [...] "Judgment". He portrayed the Auctioneer in the Pirates of the Caribbean short film Tales of the Code: Wedlocked.|$|R
5000|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan of Jammer's Reviews {{summarized}} the episode as a [...] "poignant and satisfying {{end to the}} final arc and the series." [...] Like Handlen, he was [...] "somewhat disappointed" [...] by <b>Damar's</b> death, as it came in [...] "an action scene and with very little fanfare." [...] As {{a key element of}} the story arc, Epsicokhan stated [...] "it's almost as if there simply wasn't time to deal with the death of the man who would've been the leader of a new Cardassia. The notion seemingly is: He's dead; on with the story." [...] He ultimately felt that the episode made for a nice ending, writing that the [...] "closing sense is more one of 'life goes on'", and gave the episode 3.5/4 stars.|$|R
2500|$|Dukat {{returns in}} season seven {{at the head}} of the cult of the Pah-wraiths in [...] "", but he is quickly disgraced in front of his {{followers}} by Kira and goes into hiding again.

In this guise, he convinces Kai Winn to join him in his efforts to free the Pah-wraiths from their imprisonment in the Bajoran Fire Caves in [...] "", even when she discovers his true identity in [...] "The Changing Face of Evil". Their plan is put into action in the series finale [...] "What You Leave Behind", where the Pah-wraiths choose him as their emissary instead of Winn. Sisko, emissary of the Prophets, arrives to stop him and at Winn's advice shoves himself, the Pah-wraiths' holy book, and Dukat into the burning fire caves, sealing Dukat in the Fire Caves with the Pah-wraiths forever.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, the Dominion {{begins to}} advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a {{successful}} {{return to the}} space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the Breen, offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable tactics are adopted {{in the search for}} victory, including the dissemination of an engineered virus among the Founders by a shadow Federation group called Section 31. A ruse involving a murder is used to enlist the help of the Romulans against the Dominion, and dissatisfactions lead the Cardassian leader, Legate <b>Damar,</b> to launch a successful resistance movement against his former Dominion comrades. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The female shapeshifter in command informs Odo that they would fight to the end to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would not do that while the other parties would be too weak to. After linking together, Odo cures the female shapeshifter of the biological disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received and the Dominion agrees to surrender.|$|E
500|$|After Worf kills Weyoun (Jeffrey Combs), {{the pair}} are {{scheduled}} for execution. However, <b>Damar</b> (Casey Biggs), {{the leader of the}} Cardassian Union is concerned at what the new alliance might bring and wants to side with the Federation; he releases Ezri and Worf and sets them free to take a message back to Deep Space Nine to seek aid. Worf discusses the actions of the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron (Robert O'Reilly), with Ezri in [...] "Tacking into the Wind". This results in Worf confronting the Chancellor and slaying him, ushering in General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) as the new leader of the Klingons. In the series finale, [...] "What You Leave Behind", Ezri and Bashir reveal their feelings for one another, and later after the fall of Cardassia Prime and the surrender of the Dominion, they discuss their future together.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{will call}} especial {{attention}} {{to the case of}} Calvert vs. Eden, 2 H. & McH., 334, as being of great interest. From the report of this case I should suppose that it must {{have been one of the}} greatest legal battles in the history of our courts. This case raised many interesting questions in the law of real property, as a glance at the head notes will show, and gave a magnificent opportunity for the famous lawyers engaged in the case to display their erudition and eloquence. Cook & Jennings were for the plaintiff and J. T. Chase and Luther Martin for the defendants. A number of opinions by Daniel Dulany were filed in the case, and an opinion by the famous Francis Hargrave, of Lincoln's Inn (author of notes upon Coke Littleton) and John Hall, all of which are published in the report of the case. Judge Hanson delivered the opinion in this case and an appeal from the General Court to the Court of Appeals he was affirmed without any other opinion being rendered. This case involved many points of interest and importance, but as they are succinctly stated in the head notes of the case, I will not attempt to state them here.As an illustration of the regard in which the opinions of Chancellor Hanson were held I may refer to the case of <b>Damarest</b> vs. Wynkoop. * * * The opinion in this case was delivered by Chancellor Kent, and the question was one similar to Lamar vs. Clarke, 3 H. & McH., 338, a question of limitations. The decree of Chancellor Hanson was reversed by the Court of Appeals in the latter case. Chancellor Kent, in the case first mentioned, adopted the view of Hanson instead of that of the Court of Appeals, and in doing so used this language:"* * * This is clear judicial sanction to the doctrine of Lord Talbot, and, therefore, as well upon authority as upon the reason and policy of the rule I conclude that the Court of Appeals of Maryland was in this instance mistaken; and with respect to the learned Chancellor's opinion, notwithstanding the reversal, I trust I may without offense be permitted to say 'Scaevolve assentior.' [...] " [...] This case and Chancellor Hanson's opinion were afterwards adopted by the Court of Appeals in Hertie vs. Schwartze, 3 Md., 383, where its former decision was overruled." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{resistance}} is re-opened {{in the context}} of Cardassia rather than Bajor. Legate <b>Damar</b> becomes more and more frustrated with the deadlocked conflict and his situation as a Dominion puppet.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Cardassians and Bajorans, former enemies turned allies, is charted in [...] "Tacking Into the Wind", in which <b>Damar</b> and Kira's group abandon prejudice and collaborate to seize a Breen weapon.

The Female Changeling orders the destruction of a metropolis, Lakarian City, to coerce the Cardassians back into line, but, instead, the Cardassian fleet defects, passing the advantage to the Alpha Quadrant alliance. Consequently, an attempted extermination results in the deaths of 800million Cardassians in a Dominion bombardment.|$|E

According to British records, the Gurjars plundered gunpowder and ammunition from the British and their allies. In Delhi, the Metcalfe House was sacked by Gurjar villagers from whom the land was taken to erect the building. The British records claim that the Gurjars carried out several robberies. Twenty Gurjars were reported to have been beheaded by Rao Tula Ram for committing dacoities in July 1857. In September 1857, the British were able to enlist the support of many Gurjars at Meerut. The colonial authors always used the code word [...] "turbulent" [...] for the castes who were generally hostile to British rule. They cited proverbs that appear to evaluate the caste in an unfavorable light. A British administrator, William Crooke, described that Gurjars seriously impeded the operations of the British Army before Delhi. Reporter Meena Radhakrishna believe that the British classified the Gurjars along with others as [...] "criminal tribes" [...] because of their active participation in the revolt of 1857, and also because, they considered these tribes to be prone to criminality in the absence of legitimate means of livelihood.|$|E
