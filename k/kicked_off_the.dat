5|$|Before the match, Liverpool lost defender Mark Lawrenson who had {{injured his}} {{hamstring}} in training. Gary Gillespie was his replacement.

Independiente defender Carlos Enrique tackled Craig Johnston robustly, but the referee indicated to play on. Moments later Liverpool midfielder Jan Mølby tackled Enrique late, which prompted the referee to award a free kick. Liverpool controlled the opening exchanges of the match, but could not work {{the ball into the}} Independiente penalty area. However, it was Independiente who opened the scoring, Claudio Marangoni sent a ball over the Liverpool defence for striker José Percudani, whose low shot beat the advancing Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to give Independiente a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{advanced}} to the AAFC championship in 1946, but {{a week before the}} game, Rymkus and teammates Jim Daniell and Mac Speedie were arrested and held for several hours after a confrontation with Cleveland police. The men were drinking as they waited to pick up Speedie's wife, who was coming on a plane from Utah. Daniell, who was driving the car the three men were in, honked at a police car that was blocking him, leading to an argument and the arrests. Rymkus and Speedie were charged with creating a disturbance and Daniell was charged with public intoxication. Daniell, the Browns' captain, was <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> team after the incident, but Rymkus and Speedie remained.

On September 5, 2006, Aerosmith <b>kicked</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in Columbus, Ohio. The co-headlining tour took both bands to amphitheaters across North America through November 24. After that, a select few arena dates were added, some of which were with Mötley Crüe.
