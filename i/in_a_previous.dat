5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D.

Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district.

5|$|Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler Roy Kilner coached in India during 1927–28. However, {{in doing}} so Kilner {{contracted}} a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two slow left-arm spinners in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class overs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> season, nor taken more than four wickets, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets {{at an average of}} 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.|$|E

The Regia Aeronautica claimed that day it lost just one CR.42 (as confirmed by Italian pilot Corrado Ricci, a participant in those battles), plus four Fiat BR.20s and two G.50bis. The Italians claimed six Gladiators and one Supermarine Spitfire — none would be in the Mediterranean Theatre until March 1942 — while in fact only one Gladiator of No. 112 Squadron was lost, while two Blenheims, attacked by CR.42s had to crash-land returning to base. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> fight south of Vlorë, Pattle had to return to base with the windscreen covered by oil from a shot down enemy bomber.

While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself.
