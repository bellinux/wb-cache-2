5|$|Flann Sinna (Flann of the Shannon; Modern Irish: Flann na Sionainne) (847 or 848 – 25 May 916) {{was the son}} of Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid of Clann Cholmáin, {{a branch}} of the {{southern}} Uí Néill. He was King of Mide from 877 onwards and is counted as a High King of Ireland. His mother Land <b>ingen</b> Dúngaile was a sister of Cerball mac Dúnlainge, King of Osraige.|$|E
5|$|In 1036, Echmarcach {{replaced}} Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb (died 1042), as King of Dublin. The Annals of Tigernach specifies that Sitriuc fled overseas as Echmarcach took control. An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith <b>ingen</b> Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc {{is demonstrated by}} the record of a successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt <b>ingen</b> Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the {{eleventh}} century, the principal ruler in Ireland was Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig, High King of Ireland (died 1014). Brian's daughter, Sláine, was married to Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin (died 1042), whilst the latter's mother, Gormlaith <b>ingen</b> Murchada (died 1030) was a former wife of Brian. In 1013, Sitriuc allied himself to Brian's enemies, and revolted against Brian's overlordship. Although Brian proceeded to lay siege to Dublinthe only Viking town that participated in the revolt against his supremacySitriuc retained possession of the settlement, and Brian retired to Munster for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht <b>ingen</b> Ragnaill, {{a woman who could}} have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
50|$|Endangered Dipodomys <b>ingens</b> {{populations have}} become more {{dispersed}} and less numerous over time. This can have major side effects to the genetic diversity of the species. D. <b>ingens</b> populations only cover about 3% of the territory they historically occupied. Agricultural development has severely impacted the habitats of this rodent, and restricted it to several small isolated areas. Because of this, D. <b>ingens</b> is at risk for genetic drift and inbreeding within smaller populations. D. <b>ingens</b> lives in metapopulation structures due to their habitats being taken over by humans. They are divided into several small remnant populations that are unable to disperse over larger areas because of topographical limitations. This is a larger problem for northern subpopulations of {{than those in the}} south. D. <b>ingens</b> is believed to be polygynous (one male, multiple females) but a common ratio between male and female partners has not yet been found. The study showed that translocation was a successful method for increasing diversity and population size of D. <b>ingens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Samuel Wendell Williston in 1893 {{independently}} {{also considered}} Ornithostoma a synonym of Pteranodon <b>ingens.</b> He therefore renamed Pteranodon species: Ornithostoma <b>ingens</b> (Marsh 1872) Williston 1893 = Pteranodon <b>ingens</b> (= P. longiceps) and Ornithostoma harpyia (Cope 1872) = P. longiceps. Williston {{also created a}} special family and subfamily for Ornithostoma: the Ornithostomatidae and the Ornithostomatinae. Today, these concepts are no longer used. Williston indicated O. <b>ingens</b> as the type species, not knowing one had already been designated. However, Richard Lydekker denied the identity in 1904 and, also unaware of Seeley's earlier species name, created a purported (third) type species O. seeleyi.|$|R

5|$|Flann's {{daughter}} Gormflaith <b>ingen</b> Flann Sinna {{became the}} subject of later literary accounts, accounted which depicted her as a tragic figure. She was married first to Cormac mac Cuilennáin of the Eóganachta, who had taken vows of celibacy as a bishop. On Cormac's death in battle in 908, fighting against her father, she was married to Cerball mac Muirecáin of the Uí Dúnlainge, who supposedly abused her. Cerball was a key ally of Gormlaith's father. After Cerball's death in 909 Gormlaith married her stepbrother Niall Glúndub, who died in 919. The Annals of Clonmacnoise have her wandering Ireland after Niall's death, forsaken by her kin, and reduced to begging from door to door, although this is thought to be later invention rather than a tradition with a basis in fact.|$|E
5|$|Grant, {{demanding}} {{the truth from}} the Kirbys, learns they are actually a middle-class divorced couple, {{who are looking for}} their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned <b>InGen</b> compound, where Amanda is ambushed by a raptor. The group manages to trap it, but it escapes and contacts the rest of its pack. The group flees into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Grant retrieves Billy's satchel, while Udesky is left on the ground barely alive by the raptors, who set a trap in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe diet of the onychoteuthid squid Moroteuthis <b>ingens</b> was {{investigated}} through stomach content analyses of 72 individuals collected aboard a trawler targeting Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides {{in the upper}} slope waters of the Kerguelen Archipelago. M. <b>ingens</b> is primarily piscivorous (67 % by number and 87 % by reconstituted mass), although the diet also includes squids (12 and 12 %, respectively) and crustaceans (21 and < 1 %, respectively). The main fish prey were the paralepidid Arctozenus risso (28 % by reconstituted mass), the gempylid Paradiplospinus gracilis (24 %) and various myctophids. M. <b>ingens</b> preyed also upon conspecifics (cannibalism, 6 %), and the euphausiid Euphausia triacantha was the main crustacean item. Most of the prey are pelagic organisms performing diurnal migration, suggesting that the benthopelagic M. <b>ingens</b> catch them when they are near the bottom during the day. In turn, M. <b>ingens</b> is a prey for several species of top predators, including D. eleginoides and air-breathing vertebrates. M. <b>ingens</b> thus contributes to carbon export from the pelagic environment to the benthos and from the ocean to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide expired by birds and mammals...|$|R

25|$|After {{a period}} of war Japan was re-united in the Azuchi–Momoyama period. This {{decreased}} the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan.

At some point, Óláfr was entrusted to the protection of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), and spent his youth in England before his eventual restoration as King of the Isles in the second decade of the twelfth century.|$|E
