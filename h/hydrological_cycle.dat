5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle.</b> Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} some {{deposits}} formed during the snowball period {{could only have}} formed {{in the presence of}} an active <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle.</b> Bands of glacial deposits up to 5,500 meters thick, separated by small (meters) bands of non-glacial sediments, demonstrate that glaciers melted and re-formed repeatedly for tens of millions of years; solid oceans would not permit this scale of deposition.

5000|$|Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) is a {{hydrological}} {{process which}} commonly occurs in coastal areas. It {{is described as}} submarine inflow of fresh-, and brackish groundwater from land into the sea. Submarine Groundwater Discharge is controlled by several forcing mechanisms, which cause a hydraulic gradient between land and sea. Considering the different regional settings the discharge occurs either as (1) a focused flow along fractures in karst and rocky areas, (2) a dispersed flow in soft sediments, or (3) a recirculation of seawater within marine sediments.

25|$|The form, distribution, and implied {{evolution}} of the valley networks are of great importance for what they may {{tell us about the}} history of liquid water on the martian surface, and hence Mars' climate history. Some authors have argued that the properties of the networks demand that a <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle</b> must have been active on ancient Mars, though this remains contentious. Objections chiefly arise from repeated results from models of martian paleoclimate suggesting high enough temperatures and pressures to sustain liquid water on the surface have not ever been possible on Mars.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in cloud droplet number {{due to the}} introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud droplet size, as the same amount of water is divided between more droplets. This has the effect of suppressing precipitation, increasing the cloud lifetime, known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect, second indirect effect or Albrecht effect. This has been observed as the suppression of drizzle in ship exhaust plume compared to ambient clouds, and inhibited precipitation in biomass burning plumes. This cloud lifetime effect is classified as a climate feedback (rather than a radiative forcing) by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle.</b> However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle.</b> Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E

30|$|Changes {{in climate}} and/or land cover have {{significant}} implications to rainfall-runoff dynamics at watershed or catchment scales, {{which in turn}} affect regional ecosystem processes. Hydrological models are important tools for evaluating the potential impacts of climate change and land cover change on the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycles</b> and runoff regimes. However, uncertainty in model parameters {{due to a lack}} of identifiability may greatly limit the use of models for purposes such as parameter regionalization or the investigation of land use or climate. Sensitivity analysis and identification of parameters with significant implications to changes in landscape features are a critical step in studying regional ecosystem processes in response to natural or anthropogenic perturbations. A higher identifiable parameter can reduce model uncertainty and is critical for evaluating the effects of climate change and land use disturbance on the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The thermal {{properties}} of cryospheric elements also have important climatic consequences. Snow and ice have much lower thermal diffusivities than air. Thermal diffusivity {{is a measure}} of the speed at which temperature waves can penetrate a substance. Snow and ice are many orders of magnitude less efficient at diffusing heat than air. Snow cover insulates the ground surface, and sea ice insulates the underlying ocean, decoupling the surface-atmosphere interface with respect to both heat and moisture fluxes. The flux of moisture from a water surface is eliminated by even a thin skin of ice, whereas the flux of heat through thin ice continues to be substantial until it attains a thickness in excess of 30 to 40cm. However, even a small amount of snow on top of the ice will dramatically reduce the heat flux and slow down the rate of ice growth. The insulating effect of snow also has major implications for the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle.</b> In non-permafrost regions, the insulating effect of snow is such that only near-surface ground freezes and deep-water drainage is uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|The Semi-direct effect {{concerns}} any radiative effect {{caused by}} absorbing atmospheric aerosol such as soot, apart from direct scattering and absorption, which {{is classified as}} the direct effect. It encompasses many individual mechanisms, and in general is more poorly defined and understood than the direct and indirect aerosol effects. For instance, if absorbing aerosols are present in a layer aloft in the atmosphere, they can heat surrounding air which inhibits the condensation of water vapour, resulting in less cloud formation. Additionally, heating a layer of the atmosphere relative to the surface results in a more stable atmosphere due to the inhibition of atmospheric convection. This inhibits the convective uplift of moisture, which in turn reduces cloud formation. The heating of the atmosphere aloft also leads to a cooling of the surface, resulting in less evaporation of surface water. The effects described here all lead {{to a reduction in}} cloud cover i.e. an increase in planetary albedo.

25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh distillation process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between δD and δ18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): δD=8δ18O+10 (later updated to δD=8.17±0.07 δ18O+11.27±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the <b>hydrological</b> <b>cycle</b> both globally and locally.|$|E

In 1905, after 18 months and the loss of 17 lives, the Kohala Ditch, a vast network of flumes and ditches, measuring [...] in length, was completed. It has since come into use by ranches, farms, and homes. A portion of the ditch became a tourist attraction until it was damaged by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, centered just southwest of the mountain. The Hawaii County Department of Water Supply relies on streams from Kohala to supply water to the population of the island. With increasing demand, the original surface channels have been supplemented by deep wells designed to channel groundwater for domestic use. In 2003 the Kohala Watershed Partnership was formed, a voluntary group of private land owners and state managers, designed to help manage the Kohala watershed and to protect it from threats, most especially invasive species.|$|E
2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere.

The spatiotemporal change patterns of estimated evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, runoff, and plant water stress due to climate change and elevated CO(2) are plotted singly and in combination. Positive future trends in ET, soil moisture, and runoff-although differing greatly among regions-are projected. Resultant plant water stress over China's terrestrial ecosystem generally could be eased substantially through the twenty-first century under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider economic concerns. By contrast, under the climate scenarios driven by emission scenarios that consider environmental concerns, plant water stress could be eased until 2060, then begin to fluctuate until 2100. The net impact of physiological and structural vegetation responses to elevated CO(2) could result in an increasing trend in runoff in southern and northeastern China, and a decreasing trend in runoff in northern and northwestern China in the twentieth century. It is projected to reduce ET by 1. 5 x 10 (9) to 6. 5 x 10 (9) m(3) yr(- 1) on average, and increase runoff by 1. 0 x 10 (9) to 5. 4 x 10 (9) m(3) yr(- 1) during 2001 - 2100 across China's terrestrial ecosystems, although the spatial change pattern could be quite diverse.
