5|$|As {{a change}} from earlier games by the developer, Sabreman is invulnerable to enemies and is instead knocked back in a bounce by their touch. However, Sabreman will fall to his death if knocked off a precipice. The player begins with six lives and few extras can be found {{throughout}} the game. Blue gemstone power-ups turn Sabreman invincible to enemy touch for {{a limited amount of}} time. Enemies include harpies and gargoyles, who can be killed with Sabreman's weapon. Later in the game, eagles can pick up and drop Sabreman. Underwurlde has three possible endings, and each was designed to correspond to the plots of the three planned sequels in the Sabreman series. The player receives a score calculated by the number of objects acquired, enemies defeated, and percentage of rooms visited. The game also supports keyboard and <b>joystick</b> <b>control,</b> and as with other games from the developer, the instructions packaged with Underwurlde were cryptic, and left the player to figure out the controls and sequence on their own. The Commodore 64 version of the game is similar to the original in appearance and gameplay.|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} a positive critical reception upon release. Micro Adventurer mainly praised Ultimate's capabilities of developing high quality games, saying that Atic Atac was [...] "bound to fix their name firmly into {{the minds of}} adventurers", further recommending the game [...] "without reservation". Crash enjoyed the game's colourful graphics, heralding the detail and objects of the game to be [...] "marvellous". However, they criticised the difficult <b>joystick</b> <b>control</b> and vague instructions, adding that the entire game is a [...] "learning experience". Computer and Video Games stated that the game was [...] "the best yet from Ultimate", and later in 1984 described it as [...] "the favourite arcade adventure amongst computer gamesters". Personal Computer Games wrote that it was [...] "another blockbuster game", while Sinclair User praised both the depth of plot and the advanced graphics, citing them both as [...] "superb".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of the band, Wright dabbled with brass before {{settling}} on Farfisa electric organs as his main instrument onstage. He originally owned a single-manual Combo Compact model, which was used for early recordings of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", and later upgraded to a dual-manual Compact Duo. During the 1960s, Wright relied heavily on his Farfisa fed through a Binson Echorec platter echo, as heard on the Ummagumma live album. On later tours, the instrument was fed through a <b>joystick</b> <b>control</b> allowing the signal to be sent through up to six speakers in an auditorium, which was called the [...] "Azimuth Coordinator". Wright stopped using the Farfisa after The Dark Side of the Moon, but revisited it in later years, playing it on Gilmour's On An Island tour. It was recorded for the sessions that eventually became The Endless River.|$|E

Compute! in 1985 called Karateka [...] "a nominee for the Most Underrated Program of the Year. It's a program that must {{be seen to be}} fully appreciated". Although the reviewer criticized the player's necessity to restart from the beginning when defeated, It stated that the Apple II version [...] "has by far the best animation I've seen in an Apple arcade game. The smoothness of the animation ... makes the game almost as enjoyable to watch as it is to play". Antic in 1986 liked its [...] "cartoon-quality" [...] graphics. Although critical of the [...] "often slow" [...] <b>joystick</b> <b>control</b> system, the magazine concluded that Karateka was [...] "fun and extremely addicting". According to Dragon, [...] "this game has a great plot, animation that'll dazzle your eyes, and player-controlled martial arts action." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new gaming device and interaction method for First-Person-Shooters (FPS) based on ChairIO, a novel intuitive hands-free interface. ChairIO {{is based on}} a stool and is similar to a <b>joystick,</b> but <b>controlled</b> by the user's body motion. The ChairIO interaction is augmented by a game console gun to form a new interaction method for FPSs. An initial evaluation compares several ChairIO and gun based interaction methods with traditional keyboard and <b>joystick</b> <b>controls.</b> Results suggest that the combined interface creates a method which helps beginners to enjoy playing a FPS immediately and gives experienced players a new gaming experience...|$|R
