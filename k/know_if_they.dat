I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E

He meets Al, and the pair join the group. He had relatives in Blackburn but doesn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> survived the pandemic.

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply {{believe that they are}} HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

5|$|His first {{appearance}} outside Final Fantasy VII {{was as a}} selectable character in the fighting game Ehrgeiz. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of Kingdom Hearts as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in this game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, Final Mix, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although {{the result of the}} fight is not revealed. Sephiroth {{was not included in the}} sequel , as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and he feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. His third appearance outside Final Fantasy VII is as another optional boss in Kingdom Hearts II, where he is first encountered by the series' protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing that they went somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in this game, Sephiroth represents Cloud's dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would portray him as a being of darkness as shown in other titles. Sephiroth's fourth outside appearance is in the Itadaki Street games Special and Portable, where he appears as an unlockable playable character. Due to Sephiroth's many appearances as a boss in the Kingdom Hearts series, Square Enix is not sure whether he will return in Kingdom Hearts III as it would be redundant.|$|E

25|$|A Remembrall is a small, clear orb, {{about the}} size of a large marble, {{containing}} smoke that turns red when it detects that the person holding it has forgotten something. Unfortunately, it does not tell the holder what has been forgotten, which makes it somewhat worthless. The forgetful Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in Philosopher's Stone. Remembralls are forbidden from being used during the O.W.L. exams, as they would enable students to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had written a wrong answer.|$|E

Today, {{all of the}} unauthorised Led Zeppelin {{material is}} available on the Internet, mostly on BitTorrent resources in lossless media formats. Decoding and redistributing audio in lossy formats (such as MP3) is strongly frowned upon among the trading community as it diminishes the quality of the audio and can make it difficult for recipients to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are receiving the best available copy. During the 2000s, previously uncirculated audience recordings surfaced mostly on the BitTorrent resources.|$|E

Scott tried to get a naval vessel to go out and retrieve Countess of Harcourt, but none was available. Some did send out boats, as did some private individuals. Thinking that she might drift towards Bermuda, Scott advised the signal post to {{keep an eye out for}} her and to let him <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> spotted her.

25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only {{able to pick up}} some objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important. Because it can be difficult for a player to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E

25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that it had gone off, shooting him through the head. The claim was self-evidently absurd; the rifle was too long for a man to shoot himself with, moreover Hood {{had been shot in the}} back of the head, apparently while reading a book. But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought he had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lord {{had gone}} to the {{chartroom}} at 11:00p.m. to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind {{study of the}} Mayo Clinic found {{no significant difference in}} the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E
