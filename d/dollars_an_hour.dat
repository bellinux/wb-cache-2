25|$|McCain has {{repeatedly}} argued that low-skilled immigrant labor {{is necessary to}} supply service roles that native-born Americans refuse. In one widely remarked-upon incident, he insisted to a union group {{that none of them}} would be willing to pick lettuce for fifty <b>dollars</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> The audience interrupted with offers and several weeks later demonstrators showed up at his Phoenix office to apply for lettuce picking work.|$|E

American Apparel {{has decided not to}} outsource its labor, paying factory workers an average of over twelve <b>dollars</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and often more than $100 a day. Garment workers for similar American companies in China in 2006 earned approximately 40 cents per hour. It claims to have the 'highest earning apparel workers in the world'. The factory claims to have the capacity to produce 1 million shirts per week and manufacture 275,000 pieces a day. According to The New York Times it is the largest single garment factory in the United States and employs more than 4,000 people across two buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Concessions won as {{a result}} of the strike {{included}} INCO's [...] "thirty-and-out" [...] policy, whereby workers with thirty years at the company could retire with a full pension, regardless of age.

25|$|The {{arbitration}} award also gave longshoremen a raise to ninety-five cents <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> for straight time work, {{just shy of}} the <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> it demanded during the strike. It was also awarded a contract that applied {{up and down the}} West Coast. The strike also prompted union organizer Carmen Lucia to organize the Department Store Workers Union and the Retail Clerks Association in San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|As is {{expected}} {{with a new}} band, the Agony Four would practice any place {{that would allow them}} and had an in-tune piano, most frequently practicing at Cape Central High School, the Bluebird Confectionery on Broadway and Fountain, and the Sweet Shop on Main Street. The band, or “orchestra” as they liked to call themselves, toured the local area, charging anywhere from one <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to five <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> night, with the rate per hour doubling after midnight.|$|R

50|$|Workers {{set their}} own hours and are not under any {{obligation}} to accept any particular task. Because workers are paid as contractors rather than employees, requesters don't have to file forms, nor pay payroll taxes, and they avoid laws stipulating conditions regarding minimum wage, overtime, and workers compensation. Workers, though, must report their income as self-employment income. The average wage for the multiple microtasks assigned, if performed quickly, is about one <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> with each task averaging a few cents.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the second}} 1992 Presidential Debate, Ross Perot argued: We {{have got to}} stop sending jobs overseas.

But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.|$|E
50|$|Indian {{actors were}} also {{unhappy with the}} {{difference}} in pay between them and non-Indian actors. Non-Indian extras made eleven <b>dollars</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> while Indian extras would only make five dollars and fifty cents an hour.

60|$|When we were {{dismounted}} {{and it came}} to settling, {{the shouting}} and jawing and swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly deafening. One fellow would demand <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{for the use of}} his donkey; another claimed half <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> for pricking him up, another a quarter for helping in that service, and about fourteen guides presented bills for showing us the way through the town and its environs; and every vagrant of them was more vociferous, and more vehement and more frantic in gesture than his neighbor. We paid one guide and paid for one muleteer to each donkey.|$|R
5000|$|The Qatari Football Association {{has been}} criticized for hiring migrant workers to fill their empty stadiums in the Qatar Stars League, paying them one <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to [...] "sit in the stadiums and pretend to have fun". The spread of paid fans was cited as a “significant reason” for low {{attendance}} rates among Qatari residents. According to a recent survey, only one third of the 1,079 Qatar residents surveyed had attended a football match during the previous season. The results of the survey, published by Qatar’s Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics cast doubts of claims that everything in Qatar “revolves around sport.” ...|$|R

50|$|Jock Blair {{first had}} the idea to remake the story in 1981 {{when he was working}} at the South Australian Film Corporation. It was {{originally}} envisioned {{that it would be a}} mini series but it was budgeted at a million <b>dollars</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> which was felt to be too expensive. So it was decided to make a film as well at the same time, based on separate scripts.|$|E
60|$|There are, however, public carriages--roomy vehicles, dragged by two horses, {{clean and}} nice, and very {{well suited to}} ladies visiting the city. But they have none of the {{attributes}} of the cab. As a rule, they {{are not to be}} found standing about. They are very slow. They are very dear. <b>A</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> is the regular charge; but one cannot regulate one's motion by the hour. Going out to dinner and back costs two <b>dollars,</b> over <b>a</b> distance which in London would cost two shillings. As a rule, the cost is four times that of a cab, and the rapidity half that of a cab. Under these circumstances, I think I am justified in saying that there is no mode of getting about in New York to see anything.|$|R
50|$|Padre Las Casas {{is located}} {{in the foothills of the}} Cordillera Central. The economy of the town is as a service depot for local farmers and farmers for quite a {{distance}} into the mountains to which it is the easiest point of contact. There is also a large service economy and an efficient bus cooperative that connects mainly with Azua and the towns along the way. Full-time employment for males runs about 50% but many males do some kind of work but much of this pays less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> while entrepreneurs in retail and other small businesses may easily make the owner a 200-500 weekly income. The disparity is great even in the microcosm of this small town.|$|R
5000|$|Likewise, in 2000 Clinton {{worked with}} Republicans to give China entry into WTO and [...] "most favored nation" [...] trading status (i.e., the same low tariffs promised {{to any other}} WTO member). NAFTA and WTO advocates {{promoted}} an optimistic vision of the future, with prosperity {{to be based on}} intellectuals skills and managerial know-how more than on routine hand labor. They promised that free trade meant lower prices for consumers. Opposition to liberalized trade came increasingly from labor unions, who argued that this system also meant lower wages and fewer jobs for American workers who could not compete against wages of less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> The shrinking size and diminished political clout of these unions repeatedly left them on the losing side.|$|R
50|$|Lorraine Lasnier has a {{professional}} background in {{administration and the}} arts, and she once owned a jewelry business. After suffering a serious illness, she researched alternative medicine and became active with events pertaining to indigenous spirituality.

Some of this is refunded by the government one year later.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, Oakland Athletics owner Charles O.

5000|$|Although Jones {{had scored}} several Top 10 hits in 1967 and 1968 (including the #1 hit [...] "Walk Through This World with Me"), [...] "Small Time Laboring Man" [...] was a disappointment, barely making the Top 30. The maudlin ballad, which {{tells the story}} of a man who [...] "toils and sweats" [...] for [...] "a <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> eight <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day," [...] {{contained}} gospel elements tinged with patriotism ("I'd fight for my country with my callous hands") and Jones typically committed, heartfelt vocal, but the single may have been too dour for even the conservative country audience, with Nick Tosches commenting in his article [...] "The Devil in George Jones" [...] in 1994, [...] "The late sixties...were a strange time for Jones. America was adrift in a fluorescent cloud of patchouli-scented ahimsa, and Jones, in his crew cut and his Nudie Cohn suits, seemed hopelessly out of sync." [...] In an attempt to align himself with the times, Jones would make a rare digression from straight country and record the Montgomery protest song [...] "Unwanted Babies," [...] a folk song that George detested and released under the pseudonym Glen Patterson. [...] "Small Time Laboring Man" [...] did not go completely unnoticed, however; in a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'." ...|$|R

He performed in local Hoboken social clubs such as The Cat's Meow and The Comedy Club, and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City. In New York he found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes. Sinatra began taking 45-minute elocution lessons for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> under New York-based vocal coach John Quinlan to improve his speech. Quinlan was impressed by his vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mike either". Years later, Sinatra professed that he had never had a proper vocal lesson, but that Quinlan had simply helped him work on vocal calisthenics to [...] "help the throat grow and add a couple of notes on the top and spread the bottom".|$|R
