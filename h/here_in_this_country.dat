500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} make some changes and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm going to make some {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start out <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E
