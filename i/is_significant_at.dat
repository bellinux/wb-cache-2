In the general case, the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as, e.g., a planet is usually expanded in multipoles accounting for the departures of it from spherical symmetry.

They do depend on the orientation of the body's symmetry axis in the space, affecting, in general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semimajor axis.|$|E

40|$|The Study {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} the hectrage response of {{maize and sorghum}} to changes in price and non- price factors in Nigeria between 1983 and 2008. Time series data in respect of weather index approximated by the national mean rainfall (millimeters), area harvested (hectares), producer price in local currency (Naira/ton), and the annual yield (Kg/hectare) of the selected cereal crops were obtained. Unit root tests, via Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) equation, were conducted on the data series to determine the stationary properties of hectrage, price, yield and mean rainfall. Estimation was carried out using the Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent Covariance Estimator. Results of maize response function showed that, own price and yield <b>were</b> <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> 10 %, lagged hectrage <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> 1 %; while yield of sorghum <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>at</b> 5 %.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits.
