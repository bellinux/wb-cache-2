50|$|As {{timecode}}s in analog {{systems are}} prone to bit-errors and drop-outs, most timecode processing <b>devices</b> <b>check</b> for internal consistency in the sequence of timecode values, and use simple error correction schemes to correct for short error bursts. Thus, a boundary between discontinuous timecode ranges cannot be determined exactly until several subsequent frames or discontinuous sequences of them have passed. For this reason, most videotape editing attempts to keep the timecode of the recorded material continuous, so that multiple edits may be repeatedly over-recorded onto the same piece of videotape.|$|E
30|$|Hanzo and Tafazolli [39] {{proposed}} a staggered admission control protocol (StAC) based on passive {{monitoring of the}} admission control protocol. StAC ensures that performance requirements of a new session are maintained in a multihop ad hoc network, where mobile <b>devices</b> <b>check</b> their local resources through CITR mechanism [3, 40]. StAC is partially related to DSR [41], using its basic routing functionality. StAC strategy can be implemented using service that starts transmitting traffic with a low rate and then gradually increasing it until it achieves the required flow rate of the session. StAC strategy re-routes the session when a path failure occurs due to congestion or mobility, and it reserves some capacity for unseen interference [40].|$|E

The high pressure water valve is a high wearing part as one of controlled valve. By setting pressure pickups on the entrance and exit point, detecting the pressure data and wave. So we can diagnose whether the high pressure water valve is wrong and analyze it. By using this method, the equipment maintainer can quickly make a judgment.

The mnemonic ‘FAST HUG’ (Feeding, Analgesia, Sedation, Thromboembolic prophylaxis, Head-of-bed elevation, stress Ulcer prevention, and Glycemic control) was proposed almost ten years ago for patient care in intensive care units and have been commonly used worldwide. Beside this, new mnemonics were also determined for improving routine care of the critically ill patients. But {{none of this was}} accepted as much as “FAST HUGS”.

30|$|Compared with MMSE, the Min-max is less {{sensitive}} to the NLOS ranging error since stretching the bounding boxes has {{little effect on the}} position of the center [22]. Upon constructing the coordinate bounds, the mobile <b>device</b> <b>checks</b> that its estimated location has a large scale location error. If the ranging distance is corrupted by the NLOS condition between two devices, the estimated location of the MMSE is out of the Min-max boundary, and the proposed approach decides its location as the center of the Min-max boundary. Through the combination of the MMSE and the Min-max, the large scale location error due to the NLOS effects can be effectively compensated.|$|R

This is achieved by analyzing the relationships among the integrity tests (simplified form of integrity constraints) to be evaluated for a given update operation. This improves the checking mechanism by preventing delays during the process of checking constraints and performing the update. Hence, our model speeds up the checking process...|$|R

50|$|Packet {{filtering}} firewalls work {{mainly on}} the first three layers of the OSI reference model, which means {{most of the work}} is done between the network and physical layers, {{with a little bit of}} peeking into the transport layer to figure out source and destination port numbers. When a packet originates from the sender and filters through a firewall, the <b>device</b> <b>checks</b> for matches to any of the packet filtering rules that are configured in the firewall and drops or rejects the packet accordingly. When the packet passes through the firewall, it filters the packet on a protocol/port number basis (GSS). For example, if a rule in the firewall exists to block telnet access, then the firewall will block the TCP protocol for port number 23.|$|R

5000|$|Level-triggered {{interrupt}} {{is favored}} by some {{because it is}} easy to share the interrupt request line without losing the interrupts, when multiple shared devices interrupt at the same time. Upon detecting assertion of the interrupt line, the CPU must search through the devices sharing the interrupt request line until one who triggered the interrupt is detected. After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the interrupt line status to determine whether any other devices also needs service. If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids <b>checking</b> the remaining <b>devices</b> on the line. Since some devices interrupt more frequently than others, and other device interrupts are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of <b>device</b> <b>checks</b> is employed to increase efficiency.
