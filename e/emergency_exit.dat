5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E

5|$|The Treasury Building is {{the center}} of a network of {{underground}} tunnels. In addition to the tunnel connecting it to the White House, another tunnel runs from the Treasury Building to Riggs National Bank, while yet another connects to the Treasury Annex (since 2015 known as Freedman's Bank). Unlike the White House to Treasury Building tunnel, which was constructed as an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit,</b> the other tunnels were built to facilitate the movement of freight and access to utility lines.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four tracks {{underneath}} this station, {{which are not}} visible from the platforms. An <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> located {{in the middle of}} the Jamaica-bound platform leads to this lower level. The two outer tracks lead to Jamaica Yard while the two center tracks are used for reversing trains from Forest Hills–71st Avenue and end at bumper blocks just east of 75th Avenue under the mainline tracks.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was a German {{politician}} {{who was the}} leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ("Leader") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. He killed himself by gunshot on 30 April 1945 in his Führerbunker in Berlin. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, committed suicide with him by taking cyanide. In accordance with Hitler's prior instructions, that afternoon their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker's <b>emergency</b> <b>exit,</b> doused in petrol, and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden outside the bunker. Records in the Soviet archives show that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970, when they were again exhumed, cremated, and the ashes scattered.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{reference}} law for {{the construction}} of new tunnels belonging to the Trans-European Road Network currently calls for the implementation of <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> when the expected traffic in the tunnel is larger than 2000 vehicles/hour per lane and the length of the tunnel is more than 1000 m. <b>Emergency</b> <b>exits</b> must allow the road users to abandon the tunnel afoot and in safety and to reach a safe place in case of accident or fire. Apart from allowing pedestrian flow outside the tunnel, such exits also have to provide a pedestrian route for access to the tunnel by first aid services. <b>Emergency</b> <b>exits</b> can provide a path toward an emergency tunnel which leads pedestrians to the outside or to shelters with escape routes separated by the tube of the tunnel. The Italian legislative decree n. 264, published on October 5 th, 2006, imposes that the distance between <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> must not exceed 500 m. Sizing <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> can be submitted to the application of the technical norms of prevention and protection by fires. The legislation related to the minimum safety requirements for tunnels of the Trans-European Road Network does not clearly state anything concerning this aspect. This paper proposes a methodology for the verification of correct spatial positioning and sizing of the width of <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> of road tunnels, considering such width {{as a function of the}} expected vehicular flow for the tunnel, the distance between two <b>emergency</b> <b>exits,</b> the number of lanes in the tunnel and the average coefficient of occupation of the transiting vehicles...|$|R

5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies of Hitler and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried up the stairs and through the bunker's <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts {{to blow the}} hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, the capacity of the Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b>|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{confirmed}} that {{the site of the}} fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one <b>emergency</b> <b>exit,</b> and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{loses his}} job at the Pawtucket Brewery because Superstore USA has its own brewery and they cannot compete. Back at the house, Brain, chris, and peter watches tv and saids that quahog is {{suffering}} a heat wave across the city, with superstore USA takeing away the nighborhood power to allow temperatures to up with any cooling. Disjointed, Peter joins an angry protest outside the store, but after entering the store to encourage customers to leave, Peter is impressed by its central cooling system, and decides to become an employee also working under Mr. Penisburg with Meg as his superior. Later, his daughter is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter. Despite her reservations about her father, she chooses her family over her job and quits. In the meantime, Brian and Stewie decide to eliminate the superstore completely by retrieving Peter's tank, and driving it through the superstore, while Peter and Meg escape through an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> After bulldozing the store, Brian and Stewie drive outside and demolish it and Penisburg with the tank's cannon. Immediately afterwards, the electricity supply to Quahog is restored, and life returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily {{arranges}} a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E
