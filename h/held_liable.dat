5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is <b>held</b> <b>liable,</b> unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Junior {{doctors in}} most provinces in South Africa are {{compelled}} to work 30 -hour shifts without a break.
