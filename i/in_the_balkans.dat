5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Barrons' {{early career}} {{was spent in}} various staff and field posts in the UK, across Europe, and in the Far East. He also spent time working at the Ministry of Defence and in education.

5|$|In February 1944, Hitler {{approved}} {{the creation of}} an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was intended to protect ethnic Albania but remain under German control. It was meant to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). Himmler's goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Seljuk Turks and the {{overthrow}} of Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068–71), the Byzantine Empire experienced a decade of near-continuous internal turmoil and rebellions. The constant warfare depleted the Empire's armies, devastated Asia Minor and left it defenceless against the increasing encroachment of the Turks. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> invasions by the Pechenegs and the Cumans devastated Bulgaria, and the Serbian princes renounced their allegiance to the Empire.|$|E

40|$|The article {{argues that}} framing <b>the</b> EU policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans</b> <b>in</b> human {{security}} terms could help overcome failures {{of its past}} attempts to achieve sustainable security <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. It first discusses the value added of a human security approach to existing EU state and non-state initiatives, and analyses <b>the</b> difficulties <b>in</b> implementing a human security policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans.</b> It goes on to show how and why state weakness has become a root cause of human insecurity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans,</b> which makes <b>the</b> EU’s overwhelmingly statecentred initiatives inapt <b>in</b> providing <b>the</b> security of individuals and communities. Through an elaboration of three key principles of the Human Security Doctrine for Europe, i. e. the ‘bottom-up’ approach, legitimate political authority and a regional focus, the paper argues there is a crucial role that the civil society can and should play <b>in</b> mitigating <b>the</b> risks to human security <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Balkans...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although the Palaeologi {{emperors}} recaptured Constantinople {{from the}} Western Europeans in 1261, {{they were never}} able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans,</b> originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what remained of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe.

Kennan proposed conducting covert action <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans</b> to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites.

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Italy in September 1943, around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft {{were found}} at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 machines were incorporated into the ZNDH. This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters, as well as six Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters. Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 bombers were also added into the ZNDH. The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20-25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with the Croats and Serbs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balkans.</b> He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church {{in regard to the}} Monophysites, by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism.
