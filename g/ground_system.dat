2500|$|An {{electrical}} connection to earth {{can be used}} as a reference potential for radio frequency signals for certain kinds of antennas. The part directly in contact with the earth - the [...] "earth electrode" [...] - can be as simple as a metal rod or stake driven into the earth, or a connection to buried metal water piping (the pipe must be conductive). Because high frequency signals can flow to earth due to capacitative effects, capacitance to ground is an important factor in effectiveness of signal grounds. Because of this, a complex system of buried rods and wires can be effective. An ideal signal ground maintains a fixed potential (zero) regardless of how much electric current flows into ground or out of ground. Low impedance at the signal frequency of the electrode-to-earth connection determines its quality, and that quality is improved by increasing the surface area of the electrode in contact with the earth, increasing the depth to which it is driven, using several connected ground rods, increasing the moisture content of the soil, improving the conductive mineral content of the soil, and increasing the land area covered by the <b>ground</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Hence substations in general {{can be considered as}} heart of overall power system. In any substation, a well designed grounding plays an important role. Since absence of safe and effective <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> can result in mal-operation or non-{{operation of}} control and protective devices, <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> design deserves considerable attention for all the substations. <b>Grounding</b> <b>system</b> has to be safe as it is directly concerned with safety of persons working within the substation. Main purpose of this work is designing safe and cost effective <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> for HV / EHV substations situated at such locations where soil of the substation site is not uniform. Here soil is considered to be horizontally stratified into two layers. Initially significance of two layered soil model is introduced and design methodology for design of substation <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> is discussed. Next, two design problems have been solved by using newly developed software and results obtained here are verified with the help of <b>Ground</b> Grid <b>Systems</b> module of ETAP – professional software. Comparison of the results obtained by both the software shows nice agreement of the results given by ESGSD with those obtained from ETAP.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve better {{lightning}} protection and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, the needs for a proper <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> and the knowledge of its transient behaviour become crucial. The present work is focused towards developing engineering models for transient analysis of <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> with sufficient accuracy and simplicity for lightning studies. Firstly, the conventional uniform transmission line approach for a single grounding conductor is modified and extended to grounding grids. Secondly, in order to overcome the drawbacks of all the existing transmission line approaches, for the first time, a non-uniform transmission line approach is developed for modelling the transient behaviour {{of different types of}} <b>grounding</b> <b>systems.</b> The important feature of such an approach is in its capability to include the electromagnetic couplings between different parts of the <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> using space and time dependent per-unit length parameters. High voltages and currents induced in the <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> due to lightning always produce ionization in the soil. This phenomenon should be included during the transient analysis of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems.</b> In the present work, an improved soil ionization model including residual resistivity in ionization region is developed. The fact that there exists residual resistivity in ionization region (7 % of the original soil resistivity) can be proved by the experiments reported in the literature and the experiments carried out at the high voltage lab of Uppsala University. The advantage of including residual resistivity is that the beneficial influence of soil ionization in reducing the potential rise of <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> will not be overestimated, especially in high resistivity soil. Finally, the transmission line approaches are adopted for studying the response of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> due to lightning for different applications. These are, influence of soil parameters on the transient behaviour of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems,</b> transient analysis of grounding structures in stratified soils, investigation of the validity of existing definitions for effective length/area of different grounding structures, current distribution in the shields of under ground cables associated with communication tower, and influence of insulator flashover and soil ionization around the pole footing on surge propagation in Swedish railway system...|$|R
