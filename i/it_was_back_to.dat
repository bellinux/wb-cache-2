5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that {{the total amount of}} material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E

In the National League, however, they jumped up to third place thanks to a five-wicket win over Worcestershire. However, they looked {{unlikely}} to advance further from that third place, as they went down to second-placed Middlesex {{at home in the}} National League, and Middlesex also defeated them in the County Championship encounter, as Glamorgan went down by an innings and 23 runs. They then achieved their second first-class draw of the season, in a three-day match with Bangladesh A where over half the match was lost to rain.|$|E

Rabindranath was only sixteen years old when Bharati was first published. He started contributing to the magazine from the first issue.

They suffered two narrow National League {{losses in}} the space of two days, to Sussex Sharks and Derbyshire Phantoms, before eking out a five-run win over Derbyshire in the Championship. A high-scoring draw with Yorkshire followed, and Yorkshire stayed for yet another high-scoring match - a National League game which Somerset won by two runs. Away from Taunton, however, Somerset couldn't keep up their good batting, and their bowling conceded 696 runs in one innings as Worcestershire beat them by an innings and 56 runs. A victory over Durham in the National League redeemed that loss somewhat, though, and they continued on the winning path with victories over Essex in the Championship and Surrey in the National League.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the UERL, the Met profited {{directly}} from development of Metro-land housing estates near its lines; the Met had always paid a dividend to its shareholders. The early accounts are untrustworthy, {{but by the}} late 19th century it was paying a dividend of about 5 per cent. This dropped from 1900 onwards as electric trams and the Central London Railway attracted passengers away; a low of [...] per cent was reached in 1907–8. Dividends rose to 2 per cent in 1911–13 as passengers returned after electrification; the outbreak of war in 1914 reduced the dividend to 1 per cent. By 1921 recovery was sufficient for a dividend of [...] per cent to be paid and then, during the post-war housing boom, for the rate to steadily rise to 5 per cent in 1924–5. The 1926 General Strike reduced this to 3 per cent; by 1929 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> 4 per cent.|$|E

Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story.

[...] He {{also referred to}} [...] "Fast Lane" [...] {{as one of the}} highlight songs of the album. Rolling Stone gave a positive review. According to Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, [...] "Eminem kicks 'Fast Lane' 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who sounded like he only had a stanza to blow us away or <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the auto plant." [...] Dolan also commented on the infamous lyric [...] "I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this, Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus," [...] saying that Eminem has been much more heinous before. According to Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Royce da 5'9" [...] performs extremely well on the [...] "hard-hitting" [...] song, even calling him a [...] "lyrical beast". Although music website Consequence of Sound gave a rather mixed review on the EP as a whole, editor Winston Robbins favored [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and said that it is [...] "hands down one of the best hip-hop tracks of 2011" [...] and that the rapping is [...] "second to none".|$|E
