40|$|Post-war development—characterized by {{intensive}} {{processes of}} urbanization, concentration of agriculture {{on the most}} fertile lands, and abandonment of mountainous and marginal areas—brought about negative environmental and socio-economic consequences. They have been particularly severe in terms of increase of <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risk,</b> which is high in most Italian regions. Over time, {{there has been an}} increasing awareness of the multiple functions played by agriculture in terms of provision of Ecosystem Services (ES), which contribute fundamentally to human well-being. In particular, some ES provided by farmers may help to reduce the <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risk</b> of territories prone to landslides and floods. In this framework, the paper presents as a case study the project “Farmers as Custodians of a Territory. ” This project was implemented in the Serchio River basin, Tuscany (Italy), and combines a multifunctional farm strategy of diversification with the provision of Ecosystem Services related to the hydraulic and hydrogeological protection of the river-basin territory. Although this case study should be read {{within the framework of the}} theories of agricultural multifunctionality and ES provision, it nevertheless took a very pragmatic and innovative approach, which differentiates it from most of the case studies given in the literature. Results of our analysis show that, by involving farmers as custodians of the territory, it is possible to reach a “win-win” solution characterized, on the one hand, by better services for the community at a lower cost for the Land Reclamation Consortia involved with <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risk</b> prevention, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of ES provision; and on the other hand, by improving the economic situation and survival chances of local farms...|$|E

40|$|The {{last twenty}} years have seen a general erosion of trust in the {{efficiency}} of local-scale planning and its continued use alongside new planning tools to coordinate large-scale policies. The solutions developed in the Provincial Territorial Coordination Plans (Italian: Piani Territoriali di Coordinamento Provinciale, PTCP) have seemed {{able to control the}} main criticism, which is linked to various aspects, including: land consumption and the compromise of natural resources; the drastic worsening of the energy balance and the changing landscape; infrastructure network congestion; and the aggravation of <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks.</b> The increasing economic crisis and the need to cut governmental costs have accelerated the process that led to Law 56 in 2014 (regulations regarding metropolitan cities on the union and fusion of municipalities). This law redefined the roles and function of the Province, and the importance of the PTCP will therefore possibly be degraded in the future. Cutting back the political heft of the Province has sparked a reflection on how to redesign the map of territorial planning without triggering traumatic solutions to maintain continuity.

40|$|The conference {{introduces}} one of {{the international}} workshops we organized in 2014 - 15 about urban regeneration. The selected theme for the Ragusa Workshop concerned the regeneration of the historic centre of Ragusa Superiore, the “new town” built on a higher plateau after the earthquake which destroyed the old city in 1693. The historic centre, shaped with a compact gridiron plan, embeds several late-baroque monuments for which was declared an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. The denser part of this fabric, made of an extensive grid of small blocks, each composed by tiny lots, has gradually proved inadequate to accommodate the new housing needs, forcing residents to look elsewhere for more sustainable conditions. The strict regulation imposed on the whole historic centre has strongly contributed to freeze this condition, by preventing the necessary renewal process. The consequence has been a gradual depopulation of the old town {{that led to a}} large urban and social decay. Using a multidisciplinary approach, the Workshop aimed to test “on-site” strategies for urban renewal that could suggest integrated solutions, to these several issues: preservation of architectural and urban character of the site, building and public space renovation, upgrading to current housing and circulation needs, creation of safety areas for both seismic and <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks.</b> In the conference we shall also introduce 3 Diploma Projects presented by our students in 2015 and 2016 in our school of Architecture in Milan Polytechnic University...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater inflow to open-pit and {{underground}} mines creates significant impacts both on {{mine operations}} {{and on the}} environment. Issues that commonly {{need to be addressed}} at different stages of engineering or environmental/ permitting studies include: (a) Engineering and economic risks associated with groundwater inflow; (b) Most efficient active dewatering option that can be implemented to significantly reduce residual passive inflow to the mine; (c) Optimal regime (pumping rates and wells spacing) of the dewatering system; (d) Optimised mine to reduce both pumping costs and <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks</b> to a project; e) Quality of mine-water discharge; (f) Environmental impact of mining/dewatering on the groundwater system and the surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, streams, springs, etc); and (g) Post-mining conditions (pit lake and flooded mine) after mining has ceased. Some of these issues can be resolved at the initial stages of the minedewatering assessment by using simple analytical solutions (i. e., scoping study). However, at more advanced levels of study (pre-feasibility, feasibility, mine design or operations), those analytical solutions can be too simplistic and inaccurate. Groundwater flow in the vicinity of open pits or underground mines is three-dimensional (3 -d) in most cases; consequently, 3 -d numerical groundwater flow models must be based on 3 -d hydrogeological data if they are to become reliable predictive tools for answering the questions listed above. This article draws on specific project cases at different levels of study to show the advantages of using numerical groundwater modelling for mine dewatering projects with complex hydrogeo-logical conditions. Data requirements, major phases of modelling, and practical use of the model as a predictive tool for evaluation of the mine dewatering requirements and associated environmental impacts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{shale gas}} by {{hydraulic}} fracturing (‘fracking’) is opposed by campaigners who hypothesise (amongst other things) that potable ground water supplies could be polluted by upward migration of fractures and any fluids they contain. There {{are very strong}} reasons for doubting this hypothesis, not least because migration of fractures to prolific aquifers would be highly unlikely to lead to pollution, but almost certain to result in drowning of the shale gas wells, rendering them unusable. Hence, despite having contrasting motivations, shale gas developers and environmental guardians {{turn out to have}} a strong common interest in avoiding inter-connection to aquifers. There is in fact a century-long analogue for such a ‘confluence’ of interests, provided by the history of longwall coal mining beneath the sea and major aquifers. Where large-scale mining proceeded from the surface downwards, major hydraulic inter-connection of shallow and deep zones did indeed result in widespread water pollution. However, where new mines were developed at depth without any connections to shallow old workings), complete hydraulic isolation from the near-surface hydrogeological environment was successfully maintained. This was despite the fact that longwall mining produced far greater stratal disruption than shale gas fracking ever could. A detailed example is presented from the successful operation of the Selby Coalfield beneath one of the UK’s main aquifers. This profound and sustained historical analogue provides a very clear lesson: given the lack of hydrogeological connectivity to shallow aquifers, shale gas fracking per se cannot contaminate shallow ground water. Provided operators observe long-established laws governing hydrocarbon wells and associated surface operations, other <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks</b> will also be minimal. Opponents of shale gas developments should therefore focus attention on more realistic potential impacts, most of which are familiar from almost any planning application, such as increased truck traffic on minor roads...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of the recent geophysical, geochemical and volcanological studies concerning the island of Ischia within the geological and tectonic framework of Southern Italy. Ischia is an active volcanic field that had a complex volcanic history resulting from dominant explosive and minor effusive activity, several caldera collapses, and renewed volcanism from vents located inside the collapsed area. The island is morphologically dominated by Mt. Epomeo, the result of a prominent resurgence phenomenon taking place since ca. 33 ka BP, and responsible for ca. 900 m of total uplift, one of the largest known compared to the relatively small size of the caldera. The uplift was accompanied by activation of faults, seismic activity and renewal of volcanism, and may be considered a main factor for inducing slope instability. For Ischia, volcanological, petrological and geophysical studies are, at present, limited compared to the other active volcanoes of the Neapolitan Area. Furthermore, the island is characterized by high volcanic, seismic and <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks.</b> Thus, this review is aimed at highlighting aspects of the knowledge on Ischia that need more investigations, in order to better assess some characteristics of its structural setting. Features such as the precise location of the caldera boundaries and the depth of the magma chamber representing the drive for the resurgence still need to be well defined. A critical analysis of all lines of evidence relevant to the current theories about the island resurgence (resurgent block vs. resurgent dome) has been carried out. Our analysis reveals that the resurgent block model, differently from the resurgent dome model, is consistent with the most significant features, such as tilting of the resurgent block, faults type, dip and distribution {{at the edges of the}} block, and occurrence of most of the past 10 ka eruption vents on the eastern sector of the island. However, as both model require an input of fresh magma into the shallow plumbing system, it is not clear at present how much magma was necessary to achieve the measured uplift, and whether the drive was provided by magma or magmatic volatiles...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is part of}} "HELI-DEM" (HELvetia-Italy Digital Elevation Model) project, {{funded by}} the European Regional Development Fund within the Italy-Switzerland {{cooperation}} program. The aim of the project {{is the creation of}} a unique DTM for the alpine and subalpine area between Italy (Piedmont, Lombardy) and Switzerland (Ticino and Grisons Cantons); at present, different DTMs, that are in different reference frames and have been obtained with different technologies, accuracies, and resolutions, have been acquired. The final DTM should be correctly georeferenced and produced validating and integrating the data that are available for the project. DTMs are fundamental in hydrogeological studies, especially in alpine areas where <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks</b> may exist. Moreover, when an event, like for example a landslide, happens at the border between countries, a unique and integrated DTM which covers the interest area is useful to analyze the scenario. In this sense, HELI-DEM project is helpful. To perform analyses along the borders between countries, transnational geographic information is needed: a transnational DTM can be obtained by merging regional low resolution DTMs. Moreover high resolution local DTMs should be used where they are available. To be merged, low and high resolution DTMs should be in the same three dimensional reference frame, should not present biases and should be consistent in the overlapping areas. Cross-validation between the different DTMs is therefore needed. Two different problems should be solved: the merging of regional, partly overlapping low and medium resolution DTMs into a unique low/medium resolution DTM and the merging with other local high resolution/high accuracy height data. This paper discusses the preliminary processing of the data for the fusion of low and high resolution DTMs in a study-case area within the Lombardy region: Valtellina valley. In this region the Lombardy regional low resolution DTM is available, with a horizontal resolution of 20 meters; in addition a LiDAR DTM with a horizontal resolution of 1 meter, which covers only the main hydrographic basins, is also available. The two DTMs have been transformed into the same reference frame. The cross-validation of the two datasets has been performed comparing the low resolution DTM with the local high resolution DTM. Then, where significant differences are present, GPS survey have been used as external validation. The results are presented. Moreover, a possible strategy for the future fusion of the data, is shortly summarized {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{essay is}} {{an account of}} the {{research}} Paesaggio, storia, partecipazione. La Convenzione europea a San Marino (eds. Anna Laura Palazzo, Biancamaria Rizzo, Roma, Officina editore, 2009). According to the European Landscape Convention, the Manifesto of San Marino is a theoretical and operational instrument providing an interdisciplinary approach aiming at safeguarding, planning and managing San Marino landscapes. Part One (Milestones) regards landscape as a “common place” for sharing opinions and visions between expert knowledge and local knowledge; such philosophy implies an overlap between different policies and practices and a precise definition of policy design measures, actions and instruments suitable to achieve shared “landscape quality objectives”. Part Two (Threats) deals with the “predictory state” by using indicators such as land fragmentation and settlement patterns. Both show at what extent previous relations between built space and open territory as expression of peculiar rationalities, have been replaced by a commixture dismissing any attempt at reading landscape as a “text”. Part Three (Landscape patterns, quality objectives and operational issues) deals with “relevance”, “integrity” and “permanence” issues in landscape. An inclusive notion of landscape offers the ideal ground where to comprehend and guide future transformations, focusing on different aspects of landscape, notably seen as a biodiversity reservoir, and as the scenery of outstanding cultural heritage as well. Part Four (Policies and managerial tools for landscape) draws some major issues in order to increase conditions of environmental and social sustainability. Firstly, in order to avoid urban sprawl everywhere and to contain related urbanization costs, the choice should be that of collecting building rights inside homogeneous districts, more precisely next to existing villages. This approach encounters the need for implementing ecological networks, that implies “biological thickness” much wider than physical separations between land uses. An efficient set of policies for a multifunctional agriculture has to be launched as well. According to European Union and OSCE guidelines, farmers and landowners, directly providing a large set of consumer goods and facilities, including welfare facilities towards the population and the tourists, at the same time keep watch over territories preventing abandonment and <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks.</b> Part Five (Implementing quality objectives) takes into account the constitution of the San Marino Landscape Centre, with the aim of promoting studies and researches tied up to landscape issues and to increase awareness among the civil society, private organisations and public authorities...|$|R

40|$|According to the European Convention approach, Tuscany Region {{has started}} through the Regional Plan (Piano di indirizzo territoriale, PIT, 2007), a {{challenging}} governance process that entails responsibilities shared among different administrative levels (region, districts and municipalities) on a crucial issue concerning landscape planning. Since {{our legal system}} traditionally refers {{to an understanding of}} landscape deriving from the Nineteenth century notion of “beauty”, being charged to the State, the Tuscany Region and the Office for the Cultural Activities have decided to undertake a common planning process. The specific aim is to support decisional processes by increasing the relevance of landscape and environmental issues inside local policies at different scales. This approach is supposed to promote an appropriate fieldwork for subsidizing “top-down” strategies, referring to the 38 different “landscapes” identified by the PIT (a sort of recognisable landscape areas), providing guidelines and setting patterns on a broad scale, with “bottom-up” planning activities, regarding local requirements. This approach marks a fundamental step towards the acknowledgement of “everyday” landscapes, meant both in material and symbolic terms (the “identity”). This paper takes into account the implementation of “landscape quality objectives” set up in the Arno river Plain between Florence and Pistoia (Florence Plain), that can be definitely considered as a case of urbanized country. Despite its relevant environmental and historical resources, this area, still rural until few decades ago, went through a deep urbanization process that changed completely its original structure, without any consideration for previous uses and for environmental and <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>risks.</b> Today the Plain is an urbanized area that mixes up scattered suburbs, shopping centers, industrial estates, metropolitan facilities and services, with crops, lawns, fruit and vegetable gardens, that witness for a still profitable agriculture. The recent "Park of the Plain" agreement, subscribed by the Region, two districts (Firenze and Prato), and four municipalities (Firenze, Prato, Sesto Fiorentino, Campi Bisenzio), regards landscape not only as a sort of “frame” for any transformation, but also as a “development device” regulating sustainability, equity and efficiency requirements in the area. From this point of view, the Park is an opportunity to preserve some 3000 hectares from urbanization and {{to improve the quality of}} life with development strategies defined by common landscape quality objectives. A set of policies especially launched for local community rehabilitation and regeneration projects focussing on the design of open spaces, has to cope with sustainable agriculture paths supported by the food demand by local market (“Zero Mile Model”). Furthermore, farmers and landowners can directly provide a large set of consumer goods and facilities, including welfare facilities for resident population and tourists. Some major issues have been investigated, such as: •	subsidiarity and transparency in the decision making process; •	the relationship between “expert” and “common” knowledge in evaluating resources and values, that entails a common awareness among public authorities, communities and practitioners about collective responsibilities about strategies and actions to take; •	the crucial dilemma between “project” and “process”, as Kevin Lynch argued about 40 years ago. In other terms, this planning approach built up on PIT’s strategy requires flexibility, even when managing issues referring to a regulatory tradition, such as zoning, or urban real estate practices...|$|R

Precipitation is here a highly irregular phenomenon due to the variability of extra-tropical cyclones. The latitudinal development of the island (~ 200 Km) gives a climatic North-South gradient. However, the presence of high and steep mountains near the sea on the central and south-eastern coast causes an East-West precipitation gradient in autumn especially, due to hot and moist currents coming from Africa. This area is characterized by the highest frequency of severe events in Sardinia. For this reason, it has been chosen as the starting point of a more general research aiming to highlight possible climatic changes involving the island. On the whole, non-significant trends are greatly prevailing at the monthly and consequently the annual timescales...|$|E
40|$|The main riscks of the {{landscape}} are the overexploitation of the soil and a high physical vulnerability of our country determined by considerable seismic and volcanic activities, and by the peculiar geomorphological and <b>hydrogeological</b> pattern. This <b>risk</b> needs to be mitigated through a careful analysis of the criticity levels in the different geographical areas and by developing strategies based on requirements and operational guidance. In this paper two different procedures for vulnerability analysis are described, designed for completely different landscape areas. The first case concerns the historical center of Sant’Elia Fiumerapido, {{in the province of}} Frosinone, with the objective of analysing the town and its exposure to natural factors of degradation. The second case is the basin of Coreno Ausonio, in the province of Latina, deeply marked by intense mining activities. These two cases constitute examples where the "Informative Representation" allows an immediate reading of the involved components with the aim, in the first case to preserve the evidence of the past, in the second case to protect the environment from uncontrolled human activities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Mean Residence Time (MRT) of {{groundwater}} {{is an important}} factor for the development of hydrogeological concepts influencing the origin, recharge and exchange with the aquifer rocks. In addition, contamination and risk assessment depend strongly on the estimated residence {{of groundwater}}. Combinations of different techniques have to be applied to estimate MRTs of groundwater depending on their time span. Recent recharge can be evaluated by the seasonal variation of 18 O/ 2 H, 35 S and actively introduced tracers. Modern water with a residence time between 1 to 60 years can be measured by 3 H/ 3 He, 85 Kr, CFCs and SF 6. Old waters in the range of hundreds and thousands of years are frequently investigated by 39 Ar and 14 C. Very old groundwater up to 1. 5 Mio. years can be investigated by 14 C, 40 Ar, 36 Cl, 4 He and 81 Kr. Mean Residence Times of groundwater in different depths of the Vienna Basin is estimated by combinations of 18 O/ 2 H, 3 H/ 3 He, 85 Kr, CFCs, SF 6 and 14 C evaluating previous <b>hydrogeological</b> concepts and <b>risk</b> assessments...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of several projects sustained by the Regional Sardinian Government Laws no. 43 (28 / 09 / 1990) and no. 19 (11 / 04 / 1996), research groups of the University of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy) and of the University Mohamed V-Agdal of Rabat (Morocco) have started a series of preliminary geo-environmental studies in the basin of the Oued Sebou. An area of almost 1000 square km around the famous city of Fe's has been studied, using satellite images and two ground surveying campaigns. These surveys aim to define the geological and structural settings, the vegetation and land use, in order to define the landscape units and to select the areas of major <b>hydrogeological</b> and geo-environmental <b>risk.</b> The satellite data used are the LANDSAT TM 5 images taken on the 9 th of October 1997. These images have been analysed to obtain the different bases for further thematic mapping, resulting in the geo-environmental map of the area around Fe's that constitutes an up-to-date representation of the geological and environmental state of the territory and a useful instrument for further risk assessment and urban and territorial planning. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
