I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her household, {{along with her}} daughters, to move from Windsor to Osborne House, the Queen's Isle of Wight residence. Helena's grief was also profound, and she wrote to a friend a month later: [...] "What we have lost nothing can ever replace, and our grief is most, most bitter...I adored Papa, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> more than {{anything}} on earth, his word was a most sacred law, and he was my help and adviser...These hours were the happiest of my life, {{and now it is}} all, all over." ...|$|E
500|$|Coward's most {{important}} relationship, {{which began in}} the mid-1940s and lasted until his death, was with the South African stage and film actor Graham Payn. Coward featured Payn in several of his London productions. Payn later co-edited with Sheridan Morley a collection of Coward's diaries, published in 1982. Coward's other relationships included the playwright Keith Winter, actors Louis Hayward and Alan Webb, his manager Jack Wilson and the composer Ned Rorem, who published details of their relationship in his diaries. Coward had a 19-year friendship with Prince George, Duke of Kent, but biographers differ on whether it was platonic. Payn believed that it was, although Coward reportedly admitted to the historian Michael Thornton that there had been [...] "a little dalliance". Coward said, on the duke's death, [...] "I suddenly find that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> more than I knew." ...|$|E

500|$|When Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany in April 1917, Taft was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter; Taft {{was chairman of the}} American Red Cross' executive committee, occupying much of the former president's time. He took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the National War Labor Board, tasked with assuring industrial peace. In February 1918, the new RNC chairman, Will H. Hays, approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt. In May, Taft was in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel, and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there, walked in on them. [...] The two men embraced to the applause of the room, but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919. Taft later wrote, [...] "Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward me, I would have mourned the fact all my life. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> always and cherish his memory." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him,</b> that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E

[...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously." [...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ...

500|$|Malouma began singing as a child, first {{performed}} on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen. In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] (My beloved, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him)</b> when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives {{out of their homes}} to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing. Yet after hearing one of her songs, her father commented: [...] "You have created something new and I find it touching. Unfortunately, I will not live long {{enough to be able to}} protect you." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him.</b> It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Ebert {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{the film was}} met with two extremes, one side being overall positive, while the other side being the exact opposite. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who was also in attendance, said in a 1992 interview, [...] "After I saw Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me at Cannes, David Lynch had {{disappeared}} so far up his own ass that I {{have no desire to}} see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different.

After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> very much, and I miss him.

With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible. After Wright's death, his surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. Gilmour said of Wright: [...] "In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound. Like Rick, I don't find it easy to express my feelings in words, but <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> and will miss him enormously. I have never played with anyone quite like him." ...|$|E

The {{pregnancy}} ended with a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, [...] "It was wrongly reported," [...] and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.

On November 28, 2005, Manson and von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony in their home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3, at Gurteen Castle, in Kilsheelan, County Tipperary, Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein.

[...] The journalist John Gunther wrote that [...] "There are plenty of vain and ambitious and uncharming politicians. This would not be enough to cause Dewey's lack of popularity. What counts more is that so many people think of him as opportunistic. Dewey seldom goes out on a limb by taking a personal position which may be unpopular... every step is carefully calculated and prepared." [...] Adding to that, he had a tendency towards pomposity and was considered stiff and unapproachable in public, with his aide Ruth McCormick Simms once describing him as [...] "cold, cold as a February iceberg". She however added that [...] "he was brilliant and thoroughly honest." [...] Leo O'Brien, a reporter for the United Press International (UPI), recalled Dewey in an interview by saying that [...] "I hated his guts when he first came to Albany, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>him</b> by the time he left. It was almost tragic – how he put on a pose that alienated people. Behind a pretty thin veneer he was a wonderful guy." [...] John Gunther wrote in 1947 that some [...] "people may not [...] "like" [...] Dewey, but (a) an inner core of advisers and friends, including some extremely distinguished people, have a loyalty to him little short of idolatrous, and (b) {{he is one of the}} greatest vote-getters in the history of the nation." ...|$|E
