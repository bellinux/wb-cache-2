It had {{generally}} been thought that Gonzaga would have to win the WCC tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, Gonzaga would go on to win the conference tournament, notably beating a Santa Clara team in the final that had earlier handed the Zags their first home-court loss in nearly four years.

25|$|In Worcester {{skittles}} all pins {{are live}} until they {{land in the}} pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down other pin(s). In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making {{the possibility of a}} spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of 'let it roll' <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alleys of the city to stop an over enthusiastic 'sticker up' (a young lad or girl employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, a 3–2 defeat to {{defending}} champions Germany saw Belgium <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second round}} again. Afterwards, the entire Belgian delegation criticised referee Kurt Röthlisberger for not awarding a penalty for a foul on Belgian Josip Weber.

With two draws, the 2002 FIFA World Cup started poorly for Belgium, but they won the decisive group match against Russia 3–2. In the second round, they faced eventual World Cup winners Brazil; Belgium lost 2–0 after Marc Wilmots' headed opening goal was disallowed due to a [...] "phantom foul" [...] on Roque Júnior, as Witzig named it.|$|E

500|$|While {{visiting the}} United States in 1959, Khrushchev was greatly {{impressed}} by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals. Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, [...] "It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning {{to work on the}} collective farms because to do that they'd have to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> provinces and live in the sticks." ...|$|E

[...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony, so I named the song after the choir.

500|$|Since {{the closure}} of Dunn's {{facility}} in 2004, Bubbles has been kept at the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, Florida, where {{he is said to}} enjoy painting and listening to flute music. The center for apes, where the annual care for each animal costs around $17,000 as of 2009, also houses 41 other chimpanzees and orangutans. Patti Ragan, director for the Center for Great Apes, commented on the animals' daily routine at the sanctuary. [...] "They relax. They take naps together. They might go up {{in the top of the}} cupola. They <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chutes and lie under a tree in the tunnel system. They groom each other and they fight and they have arguments, too." [...] According to animal keepers at the center, the 160pound (73kg) Bubbles—whose facial features have changed since his time with Jackson—is now [...] "huge and ugly" [...] but has a [...] "sweet character". The ape now spends most of his time sitting quietly in trees with his best friend Sam, a 40-year-old chimpanzee.|$|E

[...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience.

500|$|The {{transmission}} of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on rival channel ITV {{at the same time}} as the final series of One Foot led to the ratings that year being lower than for previous series. The broadcast of [...] "Things Aren't Simple Any More" [...] coincided with the broadcast of the first UK jackpot win on Millionaire. The news of Judith Keppel's win, recorded the preceding Sunday, was leaked to the press; ITV announced Keppel's success at a press conference on the day of broadcast. Renwick was annoyed that this would take [...] "audience interest" [...] away from One Foot. He said that the early announcement of the outcome of Millionaire was [...] "naked opportunism", and it [...] "would have been more honorable to let the show <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal way". He pointed out that they also [...] "killed off any element off tension or surprise in their own programme", but [...] "television is all about ratings". On the night of its broadcast ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire? attracted 13.9million viewers (48percent); One Foot, which began transmission fifteen minutes later at 21:15, attracted 10.7million (36percent). The episode peaked at 11.6 million viewers when it ran concurrently with its ITV rival.|$|E

500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
