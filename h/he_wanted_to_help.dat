5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, and he said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

25|$|Kennedy later {{decided to}} embark on the trip with three basic goals in mind: <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> raise more Democratic Party presidential {{campaign}} fund contributions; he wanted to begin his quest for reelection in November 1964; and, because the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had barely won Texas in 1960 (and had even lost in Dallas), President Kennedy wanted to help mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic party members {{who appeared to be}} fighting politically amongst themselves.|$|E
25|$|While {{commanding}} of a raiding party {{against the}} Central Powers Balschwiller, France, {{on the morning}} of August 31, 1918, Lee led soldiers' advance through the enemy wire. Lee was the last person to leave the opposing forces' trenches, and he carried wounded soldiers back through the counter-barrage. Lee spent the entire day of August 31 in a shell hole in no man's land because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> all wounded soldiers return to the American line. For this, Lee was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star Citation.|$|E
25|$|Brabham quit Formula One {{at the end}} of {{that year}} to begin touring car racing – while <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Simtek the salary offered by the BMW works team was too good to ignore. 1995 in a BTCC BMW was not a success, but {{subsequent}} successes included winning the 1996 JGTC GT500 championship in McLaren F1 GTR (so far the only non-Japanese team car to win this), and the 1997 AMP Bathurst 1000 in its Super Touring era. Driving a BMW 320i at Bathurst with brother Geoff, the pair were flagged in 2nd but were elevated to the win soon after the finish when their BMW Motorsport Australia teammates Paul Morris and Craig Baird were disqualified, the team making an error at the last pit stop by not doing a driver change and leaving Baird in the car for the run home, not realising that he would exceed his allowed driving time before the race ended.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter {{finally gave}} up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 {{to a group of}} New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan. The New York buyers quickly flipped the {{property}} to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site. Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it {{as part of a larger}} real estate deal. Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Phillies; the move also put him at the very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Despite this success, Irvine {{failed to}} finish {{five of the}} next eight races. He {{suffered}} from a neck strain at a test session at Silverstone and took time resting during the summer break. During this period, Rahal attempted to sell Irvine to the Jordan team with an additional $10million to Irvine's salary. Irvine rejected the contract as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Jaguar become more competitive. The contract, originally mooted by Rahal as a joke, led to his sacking and he was replaced by Austrian World Champion Niki Lauda. At the Belgian Grand Prix, Irvine {{was involved in a}} collision with Burti who was trying to overtake him. Burti crashed at over 240kph and absolved any blame placed upon Irvine. Irvine managed to clinch his final points of the season with fifth in the United States and ended the season by retiring from the Japanese Grand Prix from a failure of his car's power generators on the fuel rig. Irvine finished the season 12th in the Drivers' Championship having scored six points.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2008, the BBC {{wrote that}} Hobbs was indecisive {{about whether to}} fight for first team {{opportunities}} in Liverpool or to join another club for more playing opportunities. Hobbs said wherever he went, he would look to play first team football. On 25 May, Hobbs signed for League One club Leicester City on a season-long loan deal. On joining the club, he said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Leicester win promotion to the Championship. He made his debut for the club in a pre-season match against Kettering Town, playing 80 minutes of a 4–1 victory. His debut came on 9 August in a 2–0 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Aleksander Tunchev. Hobbs scored his first goal on 24 January 2009, scoring the last goal in a 4–2 victory over Huddersfield Town. In February 2009, he was red carded in a match against Bristol Rovers for fouling Darryl Duffy. However, the resultant penalty shot by Rickie Lambert was saved by Mark Bunn. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson commented that the decision was unfortunate, as he believed the foul was not intentional. In his first season with the club, besides winning the League One and winning promotion to the Championship, Hobbs was {{also included in the}} PFA Team of the Year. He was also voted as the Young Player of the year, as he made 44 appearances, where his team conceded 37 goals.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Abrams {{said that}} he had never seen Star Trek: Nemesis because he felt the {{franchise}} had [...] "disconnected" [...] from the original series. For him, he said, Star Trek was about Kirk and Spock, and the other series were like [...] "separate space adventure with the name Star Trek". He also acknowledged that as a child he had actually preferred the Star Wars movies. He noted that his general knowledge of Star Trek made him well suited to introduce the franchise to newcomers, and that, being an optimistic person, he would make Star Trek an optimistic film, which would be a refreshing contrast to the likes of The Dark Knight. He added that he loved the focus on exploration in Star Trek and the idea of the Prime Directive, which forbids Starfleet to interfere in the development of primitive worlds, but that, because of the budgetary limitations of the original series, it had [...] "never had the resources to actually show the adventure". He noted he only became involved with the project as producer initially because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{academics}} have rebuked {{the repeated}} attacks in pro-government media against Chan's {{lack of a}} doctorate degree, a point that Billy Fung says was cited by Arthur Li and Edward Chen as a primary reason for not appointing Chan. Joseph Lian Yizheng, prominent {{former member of the}} Central Policy Unit, noted that no incumbent law school dean in Hong Kong has a doctoral degree, nor do numerous deans of top international law schools. He wrote that such a requirement is [...] "irrelevant" [...] in the law profession, and alleged that many of those on the HKU council who head academic departments yet do not hold PhDs were being hypocritical. Sing Ming, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, echoed the observation that a lack of a PhD is not unusual among heads of law schools internationally. Chinese University international relations professor Simon Shen wrote that it was [...] "ridiculous" [...] to require a doctoral degree for the post, citing the case of celebrated Chinese historian and educator Ch'ien Mu, who had only a junior high education. Ming Pao Daily noted that only four out of six current or former Hong Kong pro-vice-chancellors since 2013 hold doctorate degrees. Chan himself says that he began study for a doctoral degree in 1988 at the London School of Economics, but dropped out because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Hong Kong people understand legal issues during the complicated run-up to the 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong.|$|E
