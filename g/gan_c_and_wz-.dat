40|$|The need {{to obtain}} more intense {{positron}} beams is an ever-pressing concern in experimental positron physics. The present paper explores one route of obtaining better conversion efficiencies, namely {{by use of}} the field assisted positron technique. The basic principles of field assisted moderation are first reviewed. Theoretical estimates of possible expected positron yields from various semiconductor based field assisted moderators are then presented, the general aim being to give some guidance to experimentalists seeking to test such potential moderator systems. The calculations are based on positron affinities calculated using density functional ab initio pseudopotential theory and {{are found to be}} in good accord with experimental data where such exist. The work suggests that wide-gap materials such as <b>GaN,</b> <b>C</b> <b>and</b> SiC tend to compress the positron wavefunction leading to higher energy positron band states that favor positron emission. However, these materials also suffer from short positron lifetimes and low densities. In contrast, materials such as GaP, GaAs and ZnSe are also favored as positron emitters albeit with lower emission energy, but these materials have the advantage of longer lifetimes and higher densities that favor more efficient moderation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In this paper, we discuss high resolution imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy studies which show that open core screw dislocations in GaN films grown by hydride vapour phase epitaxy have surfaces that are substituted by oxygen. It is argued that open core formation is not primarily driven by the need to reduce strain field energy, but is influenced by kinetic factors, with oxygen stabilising the open core surfaces and acting as a growth inhibitor. It is pointed out that impurity segregation can explain a range of observed dislocation core structures in GaN.

However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB 2 mutations is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings: We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB 2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB 2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinibresistant ERBB 2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB 2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients.

Amorphous layers annealed in vacuum at 500 degrees C exhibit polycrystallization.

40|$|It is studied {{whether there}} is any regular {{relationship}} between the yellow luminescence band and electron mobility of n-type GaN. For a series of GaN samples grown with the same Si doping, {{it is found that}} the electron mobility decreases with an increase of relative intensity of yellow luminescence, accompanied by an increase of edge dislocation density. Further research indicates that it is acceptors introduced by edge dislocations which lead to the concomitant changes of yellow luminescence and electron mobility. Similar changes are induced by Si doping in the n-type GaN samples with relatively low edge dislocation density. However, the relationship between the yellow luminescence and electron mobility of n-type GaN is not a simple one. A light Si doping may simultaneously increase yellow luminescence and electron mobility when Si doping plays a dominant role in reducing the carrier scattering.

For explaining the difference, ab initio calculation is performed to simulate the {{relationship between}} band gap and biaxial stress of wurtzite ZnO and GaN.

The VBM offset of ZnO is larger than the CBM, responsible for the increase in band gap. The VBM offset of GaN is smaller than the CBM, responsible for the decrease in band gap.
