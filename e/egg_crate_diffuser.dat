40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{identify}} {{the impact of}} weight, table surface, and table type on slipping in a simulation of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. MethodsA mannequin was placed into increasing Trendelenburg until a slip was observed; the table angle {{at the time of}} the event was measured (slip angle). The influence of mannequin position (supine vs. lithotomy), weight, table surface, and model was evaluated. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. ResultsMannequin weight, bed surface, and bed type all significantly impacted the slip angles. In general, higher mannequin weights tolerated significantly more Trendelenburg before slipping in the supine position but less in lithotomy compared to lower weights. In lithotomy, the disposable sheet and gelpad performed worse than the bean bag, <b>egg</b> <b>crate</b> foam, and bedsheet. There was no difference in slipping because of bed surface in the supine model. The Skytron operating table performed significantly better than the Steris operating table when tested with the bedsheet. ConclusionOperative position, patient weight, and bed surface together influence the slipping propensity. In lithotomy, heavier patients were more prone to slipping while the inverse was true in supine. The <b>egg</b> <b>crate</b> foam, bean bag, and bedsheet were the best antislip surfaces. Operating room table choice can mitigate slippage...|$|R

It was {{against this background}} that risk factors for the occurrence and spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 among commercial poultry farms in the State were evaluated. A total of 64 farms comprising 32 affected (AF) and 32 non-affected (NAF) farms were enrolled for this study. Questionnaires were designed and administered to the selected farms through interviews with farm owners or farm managers during on-site visits. Information on flock profile including farm characteristics and environment, husbandry practices, biosecurity practices, farm trade practices and employee activities were obtained and analyzed. Pearson Chi square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Values of p< 0. 05 were considered significant. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to measure the strength and statistical significance of associations between the variables and occurrence and spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 in commercial poultry farms in the State.

While such instabilities have been investigated in 2 D, no studies of this phenomena have been performed in 3 D on materials with strength. Initial perturbations to seed the hydrodynamic instability were coined into tantalum recovery targets.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} theory of the {{diffraction}} of sound on 1 D corrugated surfaces to 2 D corrugated surfaces. Such surfaces, that are <b>egg</b> <b>crate</b> shaped, diffract incoming sound into all polar directions, which is fundamentally different from 1 D corrugated surfaces. A theoretical justification is given for extending the classical grating equation to the case of incident inhomogeneous waves, for 1 D corrugated surfaces as well as for 2 D corrugated surfaces. Even though the present paper presents a theory which is valid for all angles of incidence, special attention is given to the particular case of the stimulation of surface waves by normal incident sound. The most interesting conclusion is that, depending on the frequency and the incident inhomogeneity, Scholte-Stoneley waves and leaky Rayleigh waves can be generated in different directions. This effect might be of particular interest in the development of surface acoustic wave devices and the basic idea of this steering effect can be of importance for planar actuators. status: publishe...|$|R
