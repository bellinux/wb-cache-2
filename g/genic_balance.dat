40|$|Hybrids between Syrian hamster {{melanoma}} {{cells and}} mouse fibroblasts, containing one genome (1 s) of each parent, produce neither melanin nor DOPA-oxidase (“extinction”). Attempts to induce {{loss of the}} fibroblast chromosomes by irradiation of the fibroblasts before fusion with melanoma cells resulted {{in the formation of}} colonies comprising pigmented hybrid cells, which contained 2 s melanoma and 1 s fibroblast chromosome-complements suggesting that extinction or re-expression of melanogenesis is a function of <b>genic</b> <b>balance.</b> This interpretation was confirmed by crosses between 2 s melanoma cells with unirradiated 1 s fibroblasts, which produced both pigmented and unpigmented hybrids. No correlation has thus far been established between karyotype and phenotype of the hybrid cells, but analysis of the karyological data suggests that the fibroblast chromosomes responsible for extinction cannot be numerous...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the rates of}} CO 2 production for four groups of Drosophila which differ in their chromosome constitutions. The four groups have metabolic rates which correlate with the balance of their chromosomes, the balanced chromosome groups of flies producing less CO 2 than the unbalanced chromosome groups. It is concluded therefore that <b>genic</b> <b>balance</b> plays a prominent part in metabolic control. The carbon dioxide rates {{are related to the}} duration of life within these groups. The results show that qualitatively the larger the production of CO 2 per day the shorter the time which the flies are capable of living. The agreement is not exact quantitatively. Rubner's theory postulating a limit for the energy an organism is capable of metabolizing does not hold for the six classes of flies. The data show that the theory can be at most not more than a partial truth. Cell size is found to show no direct correlation with the metabolic rates of the different fly cohorts...|$|E
40|$|Most species show {{an equal}} {{proportion}} of individuals of both sexes. In diploid species sex ratio {{is determined by}} a <b>genic</b> <b>balance</b> between sex chromosomes. In Drosophila sex {{is determined by the}} ratio of X- chromosomes versus autosomes and in some species of the genus it is related to the presence of an inversion in the sex chromosome. The present work analyses the sex ratio in 27 natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura that inhabit Mexico. Female flies captured in nature were counted and their sex ratio calculated and been called generation P, then cultured individualy, allowed to leave adult offspring which was quantified in order to get its sex ratio and designated generation F 1. sex ratio was calculated using the expression: number of males times 100 divided by the number of females proposed by Darwin (1871). The sex ratio of each population was taken using the average of all the individual counts from each sample. The values found varied among different generations and populations, so for generation P their values varieded 37. 4 to 190. 4 and in generation F 1 from 31. 3 up to 96. 4 males for each 100 females. According to their geographical distribution four North to South transects were arranged and in them means varied from 60. 8 to 81. 7 males for each 100 females. All this means that in Mexican population are more females than males, exceptionally more males than females...|$|E
40|$|EN] Among the {{offspring}} of triploids of Narcissus bulbocodium (3 x = 21) obtained by means of artificial pollination, are found individuals with 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 26, 30, 32, 33 and 34 chromosomes. From free pollination between these plants, arise individuals with 14, 21, 22, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 54 chromosomes. It was found that, putting the diploids aside, the chromosome number was not always the same in all the equatorial plates from the same root, samll oscillations occurring towards either more or less relative to the numbers cited above, which were the most frequent. Analysis of the interphasis nuclei of the F 1 and of the F 2 showed that he most of the individuals that are not diploids possessed chromocentres whose number was, as a rule, difficult to determine. The presence of these chromocentres revealed the existence of heterochromatinosomes whose number was established in certain plants not only by counting {{the maximum number of}} chromocentre, but also, thanks to the fact that these chromosomes lose their colour more rapidly than the euchromatinosomes in the root tip meristems fixed in Navashin's solution and stained with gentian violet. The determination of the number of heterochromatinosomes present allowed us to {{come to the conclusion that}} the most of the plants that, from their chromosomic constitution, apeared to be in genetical unbalance were not so, since the supernumerary chromosomes corresponded to the heterochromatinosomes which are inert or posses a very weak genic activity. Plants were found with 21 and 22 chromosomes provided, respectively, with 7 and 8 heterochromatinosomes, as well as one with 42 which had 14. In certain plants and in certain mitoses, the heterochromatinosomes, if not all at least some, have a retarded behaviour, placing themselves on the equatorial plate after the euchromatinosomes have began their poleward movement. In these conditions, they often suffer misdivision of the centromere, thus giving rise to telocentric chromosomes and afterwards to isochromosomes. Other types may eventually arise by translocation with the euchromatinosomes. Sometimes the heterochromatinosomes do not come to be incorporated in the polar groups, being eliminated, which explains the variation found in the numer of chromosomes. All the observed facts can be explained on the assumption that in at least one triploid employed in the initial crossings there was present a dominant H gene determining the heterochromatinization of the supernumerary chromosomes that alter the <b>genic</b> <b>balance.</b> Furthermore, everything leads to the belief that the H factor acts not only in the zygote but also in the pollen and embryo sac. The progeny of these crossings is in a realty almost composed only of balance plants corresponding to diploids, triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids, etc. provided with heterochromatinosomes. The appearance in this progeny only of a few plants with supernumerary euchromatinosomes is explained by the selection of gametes with heterochromatinosomes and by the non-viability or small viability of the zygotes and of the genetically unbalanced plants. Althought also related to a mechanism of <b>genic</b> <b>balance,</b> the heterochromatinization of one of the chromosomes X of the females of Mammals seems to be determined by factors which act in a different manner from that of the H gene of N. Bulbocodium. Peer reviewe...|$|E
