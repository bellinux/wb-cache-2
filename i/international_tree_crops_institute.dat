40|$|Reasons for {{the decline}} of peopleâ€™s income from any given non-timber forest product are: over-harvesting of the {{resource}} base; capturing of the business by local elite; domestication of the product; decreased demand; or manufacturing of substitutes. In all of these scenarios, income for local collectors is likely to diminish or disappear altogether. This Special Issue of the <b>International</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Crops</b> Journal brings together {{a number of studies}} from Bolivia, Peru, Zimbabwe and Cameroon assessing the sustainability of incomes from non-timber forest products once their commercialisation has already been achieved. The studies conclude that avoiding over-harvesting of a commercially successful forest product will in most cases require some restraints on harvesting, usually through developing rules and regulations at the appropriate level. These institutional arrangements are also needed to avoid exclusive income capturing by powerful elites. Sustained production can also be achieved through intensified management or cultivation. Maintaining market demand requires constant marketing effort, or adjusting the products supplied to different demands. Even so, there is always the possibility that others that provide a higher consumer satisfaction or are produced more efficiently will replace commercially successful forest products. A constant effort is thus needed to develop new products, for which the entire production-marketing may have to be set up...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceMany <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> {{farms in}} the tropics are {{in a process of}} crop diversification, even in regions that have {{traditionally}} been dominated by a single <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> species. Here, we review the factors that drive diversification and that influence farmer choices. We analyze recent literature from tropical Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, with emphasis on West and Central Africa. We use a framework that distinguishes farmer objectives in diversifying; the opportunities and constraints caused by environmental, technological, market, and policy factors; and farmer characteristics. Our main findings are: (1) Farmers diversify to increase their income by adding more lucrative crops. They diversify also to spread their income to lean times between the harvests of their traditional crops. In addition, farmers diversify to maintain or increase their food security especially while young <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> are maturing and to reduce their vulnerability to environmental, market, and policy shocks. (2) Famers take advantage of opportunities and are subject to constraints. These include: heterogeneous site characteristics; the legacy of previous forest vegetation; emergent market opportunities from growing urban centers; a diversity of products and market outlets for some crops that reduces marketing risks; government policies; labor constraints that favor certain crops; the availability of investment capital that influences particularly the timing of diversification decisions; and access to improved planting material. (3) Diversification decisions also depend on farmer characteristics such as their age, education, financial situation, and farm and family size. Young farmers are not always more active in diversification than older farmers, although diversification and crop change are often related to generational change. Returning urban migrants have often had a positive effect in terms of diversification and innovation. (4) Diversification is often a response to structural environmental degradation caused by decades of <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> monocultures. We conclude with a list of areas where government and non-government organizations can support farmers in their diversification decisions...|$|R

40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of this}} thesis has been to present the economically important <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> of the different climatic {{regions of the world}} in order to show man's present dependence upon them for his welfare and comfort. The <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> taken under consideration consisted of fruits, nuts, beans, berries, flower buds, seeds, leaves, bark, latex, and juices of trees which grow in native forests and in a cultivated state in plantations and orchards. The geographical basis chosen for this study was climate, since climate is fundamentally responsible for the geographical distribution of trees. The climatic regions were analyzed as to the conditions favorable for the growth of crop-yielding trees; then within each climatic region the <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> have been presented under headings indicative of man's major use of them: beverages, dyes and pigments, drugs and medicinal products, fibers, fruits, gums and resins, latex products, masticatories, oils and waxes, spices and flavoring materials, tree legumes and edible nuts, sugar and starches, tanning materials, and miscellaneous. Each <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> is discussed as to geographical distribution, geographic factors underlying its production, its culture and preparation for market, and its economic importance. A number of geographic factors combine to determine the distribution and production of <b>tree</b> <b>crops,</b> economic, physiographic, political, and climatic factors. The economic factors influencing <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> production are supply and demand, labor, and the time factors of gestation period, age commercial bearing begins, and the duration of yield. Physiographic factors which may restrict the localities of <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> production are locationâ€”-in respect to land and sea, in respect to main trade routes, in respect to the labor supplyâ€”-soil, and topography. Existing political conditions may either foster or restrict <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> production in a region despite the fact that climate favors its distribution there. Climatic factors fundamentally responsible for the distribution of <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> include rainfall and humidity, temperature, wind, and sunlight. Of all the geographical factors, climate more than any other determines the possible areas where the <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> may be produced; but the actual economic exploitation and production may be further limited by economic, physiographic, and political factors. Therefore, in this geographic study of <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> the basis of subdivision is climate. Of all the climatic regions of the world three are conspicuous by the total absence of <b>tree</b> <b>crops,</b> [...] the Polar Continental, the Subpolar, and the Polar Ice Cap climates. In each of these three temperature is the forbidding factor in tree growth, In all other climatic regions <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> are present in varying numbers, depending on the combination of temperature, rainfall and humidity, wind, and sunlight. Regions {{under the influence of the}} Tropical Rainy climate are the richest in crop-yielding trees. In general, optimum atmospheric conditions of temperature and rainfall exist in this climatic regime for the growth of <b>trees</b> and <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Every major type of <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> is to be found in this climate; numerous varieties of each type contribute to the length of the list. Many of these <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> come directly from the tropical rainforests; others are cultivated on plantations or native farms. The Monsoon Tropical (Tropical Savanna) climate has only seven <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> of commercial importance since the number and species of trees possible in this climatic type are limited to those which are adapted in response to the distinct rainy and pronounced dry seasons which exist there. There is but one <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> of prominence in the Cool Tropical Highland climate-â€”coffee. Though certain temperate fruits can be grown in regions having this climate, they are not of economic importance since their quality is poor due to the lack of influence of winter conditions which are needed in order for them to do their best. Since the Semi-arid Tropical regions are lands of scanty rain which occurs only from one to three months of the year, few trees are able to exist there. Only five <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> typical of this climate have attained commercial importance. One tree crop-â€”the date-â€”is representative of oases in the Arid Tropical regions of the world. The Arid Tropical climate is unfavorable to tree growth except where underground sources of water are available to make their growth possible in oases. Though other tree fruits, as pomegranate, apricot, olives, and even peach, may be found along with dates in this climatic type, they are only of minor importance here, having been introduced from the subtropical regions. The date is the dominant tree in the oases of tropical deserts and is "king of tree crops" there. The Humid Subtropical climate is an important contributor of <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> products. The prevailing climatic conditions of abundant rainfall, somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, and moderate temperatures favor the growth of a wide variety of trees and so furnish man with a large number and variety of <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Regions under the influence of the Mediterranean Subtropical climate are rich in the number and variety of economically important <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> which they produce. Those found within this climate are mainly of two types: the dry land typeâ€”-those which are native to this climatic regime and so are naturally adapted to the prevailing summer drought of the environment; and the intensive irrigated typeâ€”-those moisture-loving crops which have been introduced here from humid regions. Climatic conditions are adverse to tree growth in regions having a Dry Subtropical climate; but because of their adaptability to arid and semi-arid conditions such as exist in regions under the influence of this climate two tree cropsâ€”-mesquite and piÃ±on nutsâ€”-are to be found. The two Humid Continental climatesâ€”-the Long Summer Phase and Short Summer Phaseâ€”-are similar in all climatic aspects with one exceptionâ€”-their length of summers. Therefore, the kind of trees and, naturally, the kind of <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> in both are for the most part the same. Both of these climactic types are rich in the number of crop-yielding trees which exist within their bounds and provide man with a large variety of <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> The Marine West-Coast climate is not a large contributor of commercially important <b>tree</b> <b>crops.</b> Though the vegetation of regions having this climate is or has been essentially one of heavy forest growth, only three <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> of any note are derived directly from this source. This type of climate with its rainy, cloudy, cool weather, and its continually moist soils is not favorable for maturing and harvesting fruit crops; therefore, only a few of the hardier tree fruits are grown in any appreciable quantities. The variety of <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> and the many uses for which they are employed are more extensive than the average person realizes. From a study of this thesis it may be concluded that <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> constitute a basic part of man's daily life. Without them he would bo deprived of a great variety of products which add to his welfare and comfort. [URL]...|$|R

It shows that coefficients associated with five out of the 14 variables - PTREE, PFREHOLD, SIMPSON, ASSETINC and POFFFAM were significant. Coefficient of PTREE is negative and significant at p[*]<[*] 0.01 level, {{which means that the}} higher the proportion of the cultivated farmland devoted to <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> production the lower is the inefficiency in the production system adopted by farm households. This result may appear to be a sharp contrast to earlier evidence that coefficient of LNTLAND (area of land devoted to <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> production) was negative and insignificant in the revenue frontier. However, the import of these results is that while raising areas of land devoted to <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> production when all other things are held constant would bring no improvement to household income, converting some areas of land from arable to <b>tree</b> <b>crops</b> production would lead to significant improvement in household income. This evidence would suggest that the tendency to convert <b>tree</b> <b>crop</b> estates to arable crop farms in search of short-term funds, would amount to greater inefficiency in farm householdsâ€™ resource use. It is instructive to note that, until very recent times, the proportion of arable land devoted to permanent crops production in Nigeria had been on a steady decline, dropping from about 9.1 % in 1980 steadily to about 8.36 % in 1995 (FAO, [2014]).
