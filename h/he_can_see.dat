5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant.

5|$|Teenager Billy Duncan {{wakes up}} in his bed, {{seemingly}} disturbed, and learns his mother is leaving for vacation. He goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy, but her deranged grandfather Colonel Farley makes him leave before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> her. As Billy drives around town, he is harassed by bullies Chuck Boran and Froggy, and by two police deputies who give him a speeding ticket. Billy wanders into the desert and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, pretending to shoot things, then realizes he can fire the weapon while wearing the pendant. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around {{to head back to}} Earth. Context implies that the two aliens, upon departing Earth, left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had, but they have now learned that they were in error.|$|E
5|$|When he {{has trouble}} sleeping, Chris gets a {{prescription}} for sleeping pills. Kyle and his grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), later find Chris collapsed {{in the garden and}} Karl tells Chris to stop taking the sleeping pills. Chris ignores his advice and starts sleepwalking. Chris also has a series of one-night stands and gets two warnings at work from his new boss, Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh).

Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) drives Chris to the prison, so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> Hudson and sort things out. Hudson tells Chris that he cut off contact as he needed time to prepare himself for prison. Chris asks Hudson to give their relationship another go and he agrees.

5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E

The servant girl {{attempts}} to bring him some, but Jöns stops her, and Raval dies alone and uncomforted.

25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room. The {{whole point of the}} thought experiment is to put someone inside the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} appears {{again in}} Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when Harry {{has been looking}} for comfort upon Sirius's death, hoping <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> him later as a ghost. Nick explains that only witches and wizards who fear death and refuse to go on can become ghosts, dashing Harry's hope of communicating with Sirius. He appears briefly in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Harry asks him {{to bring him to}} the Grey Lady.|$|E
25|$|Like Misao <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{demons and}} spirits, {{and is also}} in love with her. However, he refuses to believe that humans and demons can live in harmony and uses his {{abilities}} to destroy them. Due to this, despite Misao and Kyo's attempts to prove that not all demons are like the one who scarred him, due to his attempts to destroy their relationship, ignoring the fact his actions put them both in grave danger, {{it looks like they}} will forever be on bad terms.|$|E

25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if {{he hears a}} lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched him}} as a student of politics, rather than someone {{involved}} in politics, and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman {{as well as a}} politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that some of his work being completed.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{senses of}} sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> with perfect clarity at greater {{distances}} than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced {{in a similar}} manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take. He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, {{as a type of}} natural lie detector, such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.|$|E
