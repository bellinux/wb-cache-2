5|$|A {{short film}} based upon Half-Life {{entitled}} Half-Life: Uplink, {{was developed by}} Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and was released on March 15, 1999. However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation, after itself and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was very poor. The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has <b>happened</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he {{was stripped of}} all titles by the UCI due {{to the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this <b>happened,</b> <b>there</b> would be no alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and others}} {{sympathetic}} to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine {{the purpose of the}} meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had <b>happened</b> <b>there.</b> As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had <b>happened,</b> <b>there</b> were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties <b>happened</b> <b>there</b> because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though some}} use of astrology by the {{emperors}} {{appears to have}} <b>happened,</b> <b>there</b> was also a prohibition on astrology {{to a certain extent}} as well. In the 1st century CE, Publius Rufus Anteius was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor Nero. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide. At this time, astrology was likely to result in charges of magic and treason.|$|E
25|$|In West Germany, Münch {{took part}} in {{discussion}} meetings and commemoration ceremonies. He was appreciated for having saved many Auschwitz prisoners {{at the risk of}} his own life. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, he made a journey back to the concentration camp. Münch was invited by Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of Josef Mengele's experiments on twins. Münch and Kor signed public declarations regarding what had <b>happened</b> <b>there</b> and declaring that such a thing should never be allowed to happen again.|$|E

25|$|Reilly and a British SIS agent {{posing as}} one of the {{exhibition}} pilots diverted the attention of spectators while they removed the magneto from the wreck and substituted another. The SIS agent quickly made detailed drawings of the German magneto, and when the airplane had been removed to a hangar, the agent and Reilly managed to restore the original magneto. However, another biographer, Andrew Cook, has countered that this incident never <b>happened.</b> <b>There</b> is no documentary evidence of any plane crashes occurring during the event.|$|E
25|$|Bill takes {{a taxi to}} {{the country}} mansion {{mentioned}} by Nick. He gives the password and discovers a sexual ritual is taking place. A woman warns him he is in terrible danger. A porter then takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked Master of Ceremonies confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten it. The masked woman {{who had tried to}} warn Bill intervenes and insists that she will redeem him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what <b>happened</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|The detectives {{return to}} the lake in Discovery Park where Rosie's body was found.

They find Terry in the Larsen garage and tell her they found Rosie's killer, but do not say who it is. After Terry goes upstairs, Linden notices the tail light on Terry's car is broken, recalling Jasper describing the car that dropped his father off on the night of Rosie's murder as having a broken tail light. In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E

25|$|A chance {{meeting with}} Australian film producer, Colin Bromley while in New Delhi, {{resulted}} in Bobby Cash {{being invited to}} the Tamworth Country Music Festival in New South Wales, Australia. Having heard him sing, and being impressed by his musicianship, Bromley, producer/director of Sydney-based television production house, Gobsmacked and Gerry O'Leary, Gobsmacked's head of production, {{decided to make a}} film on Bobby Cash performing in the Festival and see what <b>happened</b> <b>there.</b> Thus, in January 2003, Bobby Cash went to perform in the Tamworth Country Music Festival.An unknown, Bobby Cash struck a chord with the country music lovers there and grabbed the attention of the media. A local wealthy farmer, Roy Eykamp, came forward and offered to finance Bobby Cash's debut country music albumWhat happened at the Festival, and Bobby Cash rising from being an unknown to celebrity status became the subject of Bromley's documentary film, The Indian Cowboy...One in a Billion.|$|E
25|$|Gustav Eriksson had {{reasons to}} fear {{for his life}} and left Räfsnäs. He {{travelled}} to the province of Dalarna, {{in what was then}} northwestern Sweden. What <b>happened</b> <b>there</b> has been described in Peder Svart's chronicle, which can be described as a strongly biased heroic tale about Gustav Eriksson. The Dalarna adventures of Gustav that could be described {{as a part of the}} national heritage of Sweden, can therefore not be verified in a satisfying way. He is supposed to have tried to gather troops among the peasantry in the province, but with little success initially. Being chased by men loyal to king Christian and failing at creating an army to challenge the king, Gustav Eriksson had no other alternative but to flee to Norway. While he made his way from Mora via Lima to Norway, people that had recently turned down Gustav's call for support against the king changed their minds. Representatives of that group caught up with Gustav before he had reached Norway and convinced him to follow them back to Mora. Gustav Eriksson's run towards Norway and back has formed the background to the famous cross-country ski race Vasaloppet.|$|E

500|$|Well, what <b>happened</b> <b>there</b> is, of course—now all of {{you must}} adjust your brains—the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act {{something}} which we in music could never dream of, that people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. [...] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine what <b>happened</b> <b>there.</b> There {{are people who are}} so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn't do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course, because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the [...] "concert". That is obvious. And nobody had told them: [...] "You could be killed in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1971, a small granite {{memorial}} to Hamp was erected {{at the site}} of his hut, and in the early 1970s the locations of events leading up the alleged massacre were marked by P. J. Baillie. These included the sites of the Beevor and Easton huts, the tree from which Beevor's murderers were hanged, and Easton's grave at Lake Hamilton. Until 2017, no {{memorial to}} the Aboriginal people killed in the lead-up to or during the fatal clash had been erected. In May 2017 a memorial to these events at [...] Waterloo Bay was unveiled by the local council at Elliston, and after some discussion in the district over whether what <b>happened</b> <b>there</b> should be referred to as a massacre or an incident, the council agreed on including the word [...] "massacre" [...] on the plaque.

500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had <b>happened,</b> <b>there</b> was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
