30|$|The <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> {{and drug}} load of the treated wood samples are {{presented}} in Table  2. <b>Dye</b> <b>uptake</b> markedly increased at first, and then slightly decreased as the BL-flame-retardant addition increased. The <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> increased from 3.82 % at 0 % BL-flame retardant to 16.48 % at 20 % BL-flame retardant. The significant increase (p[*]<[*] 0.01) in <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> is attributed {{to a reduction in}} the repulsive force between the dye chromophores and fiber surfaces as the flame-retardant concentration increased, which produced acidic conditions [36]. When the BL-flame-retardant concentration reached 30 %, however, the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> decreased to 13.87 %, counting for a significant decrease of 15.84 % (p[*]<[*] 0.01). At higher BL-flame-retardant concentration, an excess of flame-retardant molecules in the solution dominated the dye molecules and occupied cell cavities, the wood vessel, and the aperture to impede the dye molecules from penetrating the wood. Addition of BL-flame retardant promoted <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> which could reduce the dosage of the dyestuff and save cost for industry.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The dying {{properties}} of fabrics with Chaenomelis Fructus extract were studied through {{an investigation of}} the characteristic of Chaenomelis Fructus colorants, the effect of dyeing conditions (dye temperature, dyeing concentration, and times on <b>dye</b> <b>uptakes),</b> effect of mordant, effect of UV irradiation, and color change in addition, antimicrobial ability and deodorant ability were estimated. In the UV-Visible spectrum, the wavelength of maximum absorption of Chaenomelis Fructus extract was 280 nm and showed that tannin is the major pigment component. From the increase of absorbance by UV irradiation, it was assumed that catechol tannin color was developed through UV irradiation. An increased dyeing concentration resulted in a larger <b>dye</b> <b>uptake.</b> <b>Dye</b> <b>uptake</b> increased as the dyeing time and temperature increased. Chaenomelis Fructus extract showed relatively good affinity to silk than cotton. Mordant, Fe and Cu were effective to increase the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> of cotton fabric in addition, the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> of silk fabric mordanted with Fe and K improved. UV irradiation let the color of dyed fabrics develop regardless of the UV irradiation stage however, UV irradiation on the dyed fabric was more effective than on the extract for the color development. Dyed silk fabric showed very good antimicrobial abilities of 99. 9 % in addition, deodorant ability improved in the fabric dyed with Chaenomelis Fructus extract...|$|R

40|$|During the {{assembly}} of gap junctions, a hemichannel in the plasma membrane of one cell is thought to align and dock with another in an apposed membrane to form a cell-to-cell channel. We report here on the existence and properties of nonjunctional, plasma membrane connexin 43 (Cx 43) hemichannels. The opening of the hemichannels was demonstrated by the cellular uptake of 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein from the culture medium when extracellular calcium levels were reduced. <b>Dye</b> <b>uptake</b> exhibited properties {{similar to those of}} gap junction channels. For example, using different dyes, the levels of uptake were correlated with molecular size: 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein (approximately 32 %), 7 - hydroxycoumarin- 3 -carboxylic acid (approximately 24 %), fura- 2 (approximately 11 %), and fluorescein-dextran (approximately 0. 4 %). Octanol and heptanol also reduced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> by approximately 50 %. Detailed analysis of one clone of Novikoff cells transfected with a Cx 43 antisense expression vector revealed a reduction in <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> levels according to uptake assays and a corresponding decrease in intercellular dye transfer rates in microinjection experiments. In addition, a more limited decrease in membrane resistance upon reduction of extracellular calcium was detected in electrophysiological studies of antisense transfectants, in contrast to control cells. Studies of <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> in HeLa cells also demonstrated a large increase following transfection with Cx 43. Together these observations indicate that Cx 43 is responsible for the hemichannel function in these cultured cells. Similar <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> results were obtained with normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, which express Cx 43. <b>Dye</b> <b>uptake</b> can be dramatically inhibited by 12 -O-tetradeconylphorbol- 13 -acetate-activated protein kinase C in these cell systems and by a temperature-sensitive tyrosine protein kinase, pp 60 v-src in LA 25 -NRK cells.

40|$|Marked {{increase}} in cell permeability ascribed to open connexin (Cx) 43 hemichannels is induced by metabolic inhibition (MI) of cortical astrocytes in culture, but the molecular mechanisms are not established. Dephosphorylation and/or oxidation of Cx 43 hemichannels was proposed {{as a potential}} mechanism to increase their open probability. We now demonstrate that MI increases the number of hemichannels on the cell surface assayed by biotinylation and Western blot, and that this change is followed by increased dephosphorylation and S-nitrosylation. The {{increase in}} rate of <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> caused by MI {{is comparable to the}} increase in surface expression; thus, open probability and permeation per hemichannel may be unchanged. Reducing agents did not affect dephosphorylation of Cx 43 hemichannels but reduced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> and S-nitrosylation. Uptake was also reduced by elevated intracellular but not extracellular levels of reduced glutathione. Moreover, nitric oxide donors induced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> and nitrosylation of surface Cx 43 but did not affect its abundance or phosphorylation. Thus, permeability per channel is increased, presumably because of increase in open probability. We propose that increased <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> induced by MI is mediated by an increased number of Cx 43 hemichannels in the surface and is associated with multiple molecular changes, among which nitrosylation of intracellular Cx 43 cysteine residues may be a critical factor...|$|R

40|$|Rat {{cortical}} astrocytes in {{pure culture}} are functionally coupled to neighboring cells via connexin (Cx) 43 gap junctions under ordinary conditions. Small fluorescent molecules such as Lucifer yellow (LY) pass between cell interiors via gap junctions, {{but do not}} enter the cells when externally applied. Subjecting rat and mouse cortical astrocytes to “chemical ischemia” by inhibition of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism induced permeabilization of cells to Lucifer yellow and ethidium bromide before loss of membrane integrity determined by dextran uptake and lactate dehydrogenase release. The gap junction blockers octanol and 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid markedly reduced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake,</b> suggesting that uptake was mediated by opening of unapposed hemichannels. Extracellular La 3 + also reduced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> and delayed cell death. The purinergic blocker, oxidized ATP, was ineffective. Astrocytes isolated from mice with targeted deletion of the Cx 43 coding DNA exhibited greatly reduced dye coupling and ischemia-induced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake,</b> evidence that <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> is mediated by Cx 43 hemichannels. Dye coupling was reduced but not blocked by metabolic inhibition. Blockade of lipoxygenases or treatment with free radical scavengers reduced <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> by rat astrocytes, suggesting a role for arachidonic acid byproducts in hemichannel opening. Furthermore, permeabilization was accompanied by reduction in ATP levels and dephosphorylation of Cx 43. Although hemichannel opening would tend to collapse electrochemical and metabolic gradients across the plasma membrane of dying cells, healthy cells might rescue dying cells by transfer of ions and essential metabolites via Cx 43 gap junctions. Alternatively, dying astrocytes might compromise the health of neighboring cells via Cx 43 gap junctions, thereby promoting the propagation of cell death...|$|R

Through such an understanding, a better process for obtaining {{a product of the}} desired quality can be developed. For this, bench scale dyeing experiments were carried out in a specially designed dyeing tank and <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> by the fibre was monitored by dye solution sampling. The <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> rate was related to the structure and properties of polyester. Plasticizing effect of one common carrier and solubilizing effect of surfactants were investigated individually.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that hemichannels, which form gap junctions when paired from apposing cells, may serve additional roles when unpaired including cell adhesion and paracrine communication. Hemichannels in mammals are formed by connexins or pannexins, while in insects they are formed by pannexin homologues termed innexins. The formation of functional gap junctions by insect innexins has been established, although their ability to form functional nonjunctional hemichannels has not been reported. Here the characteristics of nonjunctional hemichannels were examined in three lepidopteran cell types, two cell lines (High Five and Sf 9) and explanted hemocytes from Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Selective fluorescent <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> by hemichannels was observed in a significant minority of cells, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.

Dithiothreitol [(DTT) 10 mM], a membrane permeant-reducing agent, increased the rate of <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> by cells expressing Cx 43 and Cx 43 -EGFP, but not by parental cells or cells expressing EGFP-Cx 43.

Amur cork tree dyed silk was treated in a 100 o C oven for 0 - 240 hours. he berberine content in liquid dye {{was measured by the}} relative abundance of the berberine peak in the PLC-MS chromatograms. The color and <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> of <b>dyed</b> silk was measured using K/S value and olorimetric data. The berberine content in standard berberine dye was 2. 4 times that of the amur cork tree xtract. A similar result was observed between the K/S value of standard berberine dyed silk and that o...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{low-temperature}} plasma (LTP) {{on the surface}} modification of Tencel fabric was studied using the plasma gases of oxygen and argon. The experimental results showed that argon plasma caused higher fabric weight loss. In addition, {{there was a tremendous}} decrease in the whiteness of the testing specimens {{as a result of the}} long exposure of argon LTP treatment. The results of scanning electron microscopy showed that short exposure of argon or oxygen plasma increased the surface roughness on Tencel fabric that promoted the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake.</b> The contact angle test result showed that the wettability is increased by means of short-exposure LTP treatment. The generation of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in Tencel during the oxygen or argon LTP treatment was confirmed by the result of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the increased hydroxyl groups will assist the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Background—Activation of both type 1 {{and type}} 2 tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) receptors (TNFR 1 and TNFR 2) confers cytoprotection in cardiac myocytes. Noting that the scaffolding protein TNF receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF 2) {{is common to}} both TNF receptors, we hypothesized that the cytoprotective responses of TNF were mediated through TRAF 2. Methods and Results—Mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of low levels of TNF (MHCsTNF 3) and TRAF 2 (MHC-TRAF 2 LC) and mice lacking TNFR 1, TNFR 2, and TNFR 1 /TNFR 2 were subjected to ischemia (30 minutes) reperfusion (30 minutes) injury ex vivo using a Langendorff apparatus. MHCsTNF 3 mice were protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury as shown by a significant 30 % greater left ventricular developed pressure, 80 % lower creatine kinase release, and Evans blue <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> compared with littermates. The extent of ischemia-reperfusion induced injury was similar in wild-type, TNFR 1, and TNFR 2 deficient mice; however, mice lacking TNFR 1 /TNFR 2 had a significant 40 % lower left ventricular developed pressure, a 65 % greater creatine kinase release, and 40 % greater Evans blue <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> compared with littermates. Interestingly, MHC-TRAF 2 LC mice had a significant 50 % lower left ventricular developed pressure, a 70 % lower creatine kinase release, and 80 % lower Evans blue <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> compared with littermate controls after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Biochemical analysis of the MHC-TRAF 2 LC hearts showed that there was activation of nuclear factor-kappaB but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Silk {{has always}} been the symbol of royalty due to its lustrous {{appearance}} and peach like softness. The coloration of this royal fiber is also an art form. The process varies largely in the form of hanks and woven pieces. There are numerous ranges of dyestuff available for use of silk dyeing. Almost every class of dyestuff used for cotton or wool can be used for dyeing silk. In general the dyestuffs are applied by techniques similar to those of wool or cotton. This research paper shows a comparative analysis of silk dyeing with acid dye, which is commonly used and reactive dye, which is more commonly applied on cotton. The study focuses on the <b>dye</b> <b>uptake,</b> different types of fastness properties and the strength of the dyed samples. It was found that reactive dyes showed better <b>dye</b> <b>uptake</b> and color fastness on silk than acid dyes but comparatively the strength of the fibre was decreased...|$|R
