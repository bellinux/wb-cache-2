5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies are {{generally}} considered by North American <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> <b>to</b> be inedible, or of unknown edibility, {{in parts of}} Malaysia it is commonly eaten and even [...] "prized for its edibility".|$|R

5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 <b>Field</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{birds have}} {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of America are among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The Birds of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about the number}} of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 <b>Field</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E

The first was <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> Eastern Ferns in 1937, followed by a greatly updated The Fern Guide in 1961, and lastly The Southern Fern Guide in 1964.
