5000|$|The {{amount of}} fiber in a fiber {{reinforced}} composite directly corresponds with the mechanical properties of the composite. Theoretically the maximum fiber ratio of round fibers {{that can be achieved}} in a composite is 90.8% if the fibers are in a unidirectional hexagonal close packed configuration. Realistically the highest fiber volume ratio is around 70% due to manufacturing parameters and is usually in the range of 50% to 65%. Adding too little fiber reinforcement in the composite will actually deteriorate the properties of the material. Too much fiber volume may also decrease the strength of the composite {{due to the lack of}} space for the matrix to fully surround and bond with the fibers. Therefore, there is an optimal space between fibers that will fully exploit the uniform load transfer between fibers. Given the fiber volume fraction, the theoretical elastic properties of a composite can be determined.
