5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and <b>gibberellin</b> application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{identified}} and cloned many genes {{involved in the}} <b>gibberellin</b> signaling pathway, including GAI1 (<b>Gibberellin</b> Insensitive) and SLR1 (Slender Rice). Disruption of <b>gibberellin</b> signaling can lead to significantly reduced stem growth leading to a dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 An {{understanding}} of the <b>gibberellins</b> present in Douglas-fir is essential to understanding and controlling the growth and development of this species. A technique was developed which permits the separation of certain <b>gibberellins</b> with high performance liquid chromatography and their identification with mass spectrometry. An extraction technique for the isolation of <b>gibberellins</b> from plant material was then developed. These techniques were demonstrated {{to be successful in}} identifying some of the <b>gibberellins</b> present in wild cucumber seeds, a plant system known to contain <b>gibberellins,</b> but no <b>gibberellins</b> were found in Douglas-fir xylem sap during the spring. However, an increase in growth inhibitor levels was observed which could have interfered with the detection of the <b>gibberellins.</b> The increase in the level of inhibitors during June and July coincided with the decrease in shoot growth, suggesting that the cessation of developmental processes is the result of an increased level of growth inhibitors rather than a change in concentration of free <b>gibberellins.</b> Another explanation for the lack of evidence for <b>gibberellins</b> in Douglas-fir xylem sap is that the native <b>gibberellins</b> may occur in a form other than the free acid and therefore could not be detected with procedures used in this investigation...|$|R

25|$|<b>Gibberellins</b> – Together with {{ethylene}} they promote crown primordia {{growth and}} elongation. Together with auxin they promote root elongation. <b>Gibberellins</b> also inhibit lateral root primordia initiation.|$|R
25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and <b>gibberellin,</b> which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with <b>gibberellin</b> to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E
25|$|Using A. thaliana, the {{genetics}} behind leaf shape development {{have become more}} clear and have been broken down into three stages: The initiation of the leaf primordium, the establishment of dorsiventrality, {{and the development of}} a marginal meristem. Leaf primordia are initiated by the suppression of the genes and proteins of the class I KNOX family (such as SHOOT APICAL MERISTEMLESS). These class I KNOX proteins directly suppress <b>gibberellin</b> biosynthesis in the leaf primordium. Many genetic factors were found to be involved in the suppression of these class I KNOX genes in leaf primordia (such as ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1, BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1, SAWTOOTH1, etc.). Thus, with this suppression, the levels of <b>gibberellin</b> increase and leaf primordium initiates growth.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as <b>gibberellin</b> levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gibberellins</b> are plant hormones, {{enhancing}} seed germination. The bacterium-to-plant signal, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) or Nod factors, are {{of great}} importance for roots organogenesis and hence, nodule formation and N fixation. Hence, we hypothesized that LCOs like <b>gibberellins</b> may also enhance barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) germination. The objectives were to test the effects of <b>gibberellins</b> on barley germination and {{to test the hypothesis}} that LCOs may increase seed germination in barley. The concentrations, tested were 10 - 5 M for <b>gibberellins</b> and 10 - 6 M and 10 - 7 and 10 - 8 M LCOs. Although, <b>gibberellins</b> were able to numerically increase barley germination (up to 18 %), the LCOs seemed to be more effective on barley germination as they significantly increased seed germination (up to 44 %). Hence, the novel finding indicates that for LCOs may also be very effective on barley seed germination, through inducing morphogenesis and physiological changes in seeds. This finding can have very important agricultural implications...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gibberellins</b> are {{involved}} in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination. Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently {{in the early stages of}} germination, the stored energy reserves of starch nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water. <b>Gibberellins</b> in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch hydrolysis through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-amylase in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that <b>gibberellins</b> (denoted by GA) produced in the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase. [...] α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch, which is abundant in many seeds, into glucose that can be used in cellular respiration to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated <b>gibberellins</b> cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seed {{germination}} and seedling {{production of}} native forest tree species {{are an important}} step in ex situ conservation programs and in the reforestation with ecological purposes. Therefore, understanding seed germination and its regulation is mandatory for the complete success of the conservation programs and revegetation techniques. Thus, morphological studies, temperature requirements for seed germination and its control by <b>gibberellins</b> (GAs) were studied in Tabebuia impetiginosa (“ipê-roxo”) seeds. The best temperature for germination under constant light was 30 oC. The imbibition of T. impetiginosa seeds followed the common triphasic pattern, with most of the seeds attaining phase II at 24 hours and phase III at 72 hours of imbibition. Visible germination, as radicle elongation, started at 30 hours in water-imbibed seeds and at 24 hours in GA-imbibed seeds. Seeds imbibed in Paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, failed to germinate. However, application of exogenous <b>gibberellins</b> overcame inhibition and allowed germination, suggesting that GAs are regulators of Tabebuia impetiginosa seed germination. The results suggested that germination in Tabebuia impetiginosa seeds is controlled by elongation of the radicle and <b>gibberellins</b> may {{play an important role in}} regulating it. The possible role of <b>gibberellins</b> is discussed...|$|R
