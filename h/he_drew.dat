5|$|In a 2013 post on his blog, Attack on Titan author Hajime Isayama {{revealed}} that <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> inspiration from Lesnar {{for the character}} of the Armored Titan.|$|E
5|$|Issue fifteen {{features}} a silent fight between two characters that lasts thirteen pages. Rucka, {{who used to}} be a choreographer, filmed himself acting out the battle with a friend. Lark used the film for reference as <b>he</b> <b>drew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds {{the most fun}} in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> only round car designs. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E
50|$|Harold {{wants to}} go for a walk in the moonlight, but there is no moon, so <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> one. <b>He</b> has nowhere to walk, so <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> a path. <b>He</b> has many adventures looking for his room, and in the end <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> his own house and bed and goes to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|In the novel, Jerry Renault must box Emile Janza, {{the school}} bully. In the film, Janza's place is taken by Archie after <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> a black marble, {{as opposed to}} the book, where <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> two white marbles.|$|R
50|$|Among all the flowers, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> Japanese apricot blossom {{the most}} {{because of its}} purity of its endurance. Instead of {{depicting}} details of flowers, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{the image of the}} flower metaphorically. Just like birds in his paintings, flowers are located in the background.|$|R
5|$|Early in his career, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> {{inspiration}} from nature, making studies of insects, landscapes, and {{plants such as}} lichens, all of which he used as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the Alhambra and the Mezquita of Cordoba, and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure.|$|E
5|$|Eli Lilly {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its revenue to $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> heavily on his former Lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers.|$|E
5|$|Glenn landed safely, but an {{inspection}} of his capsule revealed {{that one of}} the landing bag switches had been faulty. Kraft was right; the heat shield had not been loose after all. The lessons that <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> from this experience were clear.|$|E
30|$|<b>He</b> <b>draws</b> on {{the works}} of [36, 37, 10].|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>draws</b> comics in Ronald McDonald & Friends Magazine.|$|R
50|$|Example 3. Player A {{draws the}} last 18th tile, which {{turns out to}} be a flower. <b>He</b> <b>draws</b> a {{replacement}} tile, the last 17th tile, and it {{turns out to be a}}n animal. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> the last 16th tile and completes his winning hand. This will not be considered hái-dǐ-lāo-yuè (海底捞月).|$|R
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>drew</b> {{and painted}} {{numerous}} preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative {{moments of the}} disaster he would depict in the final work. The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>drew</b> two unusual {{assignments}} in 1934. When the USAAC took over flying the air mail, McClelland acted as zone communications officer at Salt Lake City. Later in the year, he was communications and meteorological officer for General Henry H. Arnold's Alaskan flight, {{which was to}} do much in shaping the trend of air communications.|$|E
5|$|In 1644, Giovanni de’ Medici {{proposed}} that Fort St. Angelo in Birgu be abandoned {{and a new}} fort be constructed on Orsi Point. The new fort would have been also called Fort St. Angelo, and would be manned with the garrison of the old fort. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> up plans for the proposed fort, but they were never implemented.|$|E
60|$|Third. The cumber-ground is a sucker; <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{away the}} heart and {{nourishment}} from the other trees. Were the cumber ground cut down, the others would be more fruitful; <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> away that fatness of the ground to himself, {{that would make the}} others more hearty and fruitful. 'One sinner destroyeth much good' (Eccl 9:18).|$|R
2500|$|If Black {{is to move}} in the diagrammed position, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> with ...|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} mentioned collaborations are The Mice Templar from Image Comics, which <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{and co-authors}} with Bryan J.L. Glass, and Powers from Icon Comics which <b>he</b> <b>draws,</b> and sometimes co-authors, with Brian Bendis. His creator-owned projects include Rapture, {{on which he}} collaborated with his wife, Taki Soma, and The Victories, both for Dark Horse Comics.|$|R
5|$|In 1917, Elias bought {{stock in}} a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and {{moved back to}} the city with his family. Disney {{enrolled}} at McKinley High School and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I; he also took night courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was rejected for being too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> cartoons {{on the side of his}} ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper Stars and Stripes. Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919, where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks.|$|E
5|$|In Glasgow, he {{was trained}} in the {{emerging}} science of statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training. For example, he used statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners, who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than free blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> up statistical tables of data from the census.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{also added}} {{a feature of}} special value to seamen: from the {{numerous}} compass or wind roses <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured in great numbers {{but it was never}} updated. The celestial globe was up to date in using the information provided by Copernicus.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>draws</b> dose to WINSOR as {{the others}} are departing to their rooms.|$|R
50|$|According to Sabzi, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{inspiration}} from the Persian rugs created by his mother.|$|R
60|$|She {{puts her}} face close to his. Her eyes trouble him; <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> back.|$|R
5|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw {{represents}} {{the beginning of}} Mary Shelley's collaborative writing career, although {{it is no longer}} possible to reconstruct her actual contributions. Her sketch was given to the author of the published work as a way to inspire him. What precisely <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> from that text is, however, unknown.|$|E
5|$|Of Human Feelings explores jazz-funk {{music and}} {{continues}} Coleman's harmolodic approach to improvisation with Prime Time, whom he introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> on {{rhythm and blues}} influences from {{early in his career}} for Of Human Feelings, which had shorter and more distinct compositions than Dancing in Your Head. Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Robinson opposed both secession and abolition. Though he had Union sympathies, he was {{considered}} a moderate, opposing both fugitive slave laws and the enlistment of black soldiers. As a state senator, he supported the Crittenden Compromise and opposed the Civil War. As governor, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> criticism from the administration of President Abraham Lincoln for opposing the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
50|$|Sandman and Berrigan meet Corday at Newgate, where <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> them a {{portrait}} of Meg.|$|R
5000|$|Tsongkhapa's {{distinction}} <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{between that}} which is not found and {{that which is}} negated.|$|R
50|$|Familiar Faces (Ծանօթ դէմքեր), a piece where <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> {{portraits of}} {{prominent}} figures of his time.|$|R
5|$|Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using {{elements}} of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires. Among the poets on whose lyrics <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914–15 {{he wrote his}} own texts.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke was {{conceived}} as a rival to the series' title character, Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's darker character development in later parts of the story, Kishimoto avoided making Sasuke an evil person. Sasuke's design challenged Kishimoto as <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> the manga, but he has since grown to greatly enjoy drawing him. In the animated adaptations of the manga, Sasuke has been voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.|$|E
5|$|Suetonius was an equestrian {{who held}} {{administrative}} posts during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. The Twelve Caesars details a biographical {{history of the}} principate from the birth of Julius Caesar {{to the death of}} Domitian in AD96. Like Tacitus, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> upon the imperial archives, as well as histories by Aufidius Bassus, Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Augustus' own letters.|$|E
50|$|Reloadin Reg - As {{his name}} suggests, when <b>he</b> <b>draws,</b> {{it will have}} {{problems}} at first.|$|R
50|$|Picasso {{was left}} handed, {{while in the}} film <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> and writes with his right hand.|$|R
