40|$|E. coli is a {{convenient}} host for <b>heterologous</b> protein <b>expression.</b> Its advantages include {{high levels of}} <b>heterologous</b> gene <b>expression</b> and scalability of experiments, low cost, fast growth, a lack of posttranslational modification {{and an ability to}} express labeled (isotope or seleno-methionine) proteins. However, <b>heterologous</b> gene <b>expression</b> in E. coli can lead to the production of insoluble and/or nonfunctional target proteins. This is often due to the absence of cofactors or post-translational modifications required for function, stability or folding. Coexpression of multiple genes in E. coli, such as the members of a stable multiprotein complex 1 or a protein with a chaperone 2, 3, can in many cases alleviate these problems. Coexpression involves the transformation of E. coli with several plasmids that have compatible origins of replication and independent antibiotic selection for maintenance. The Duet (Novagen) vectors have two multiple cloning sites per vector, five compatible origins of replication and four antibiotic selection markers, allowing the simultaneous expression of up to eight proteins. The combination of Duet vectors with other commercial plasmids allows the use of affinity tags, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose binding protein (MBP), which can ease the recovery and improve the solubility of the desired target. Coexpression in E. coli therefore provides a useful alternative to the complicated and expensive expression systems, such as yeast, baculovirus or mammalian cell culture, which are commonly used to overcome problems of <b>heterologous</b> protein <b>expression.</b> A summary of the method is presented in Figure 1...|$|R

5000|$|In {{cell biology}} and protein biochemistry, <b>heterologous</b> <b>expression</b> {{means that a}} protein is {{experimentally}} put into a cell that does not normally make (i.e., express) that protein. [...] Heterologous (meaning 'derived from a different organism') refers {{to the fact that}} often the transferred protein was initially cloned from or derived from a different cell type or a different species from the recipient. Typically the protein itself is not transferred, but instead the 'correctly edited' genetic material coding for the protein (the complementary DNA or cDNA) is added to the recipient cell. The genetic material that is transferred typically must be within a format that encourages the recipient cell to express the cDNA as a protein (i.e., it is put in an expression vector). Methods for transferring foreign genetic material into a recipient cell include transfection and transduction. The choice of recipient cell type is often based on an experimental need to examine the protein's function in detail, and the most prevalent recipients, known as <b>heterologous</b> <b>expression</b> systems, are chosen usually because they are easy to transfer DNA into or because they allow for a simpler assessment of the protein's function.|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudies {{aiming at}} the elucidation {{of the genetic}} basis of rare {{monogenic}} forms of hypertension have identified mutations in genes coding for the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, for the mineralocorticoid receptor, or for enzymes crucial for the synthesis of aldosterone. These genetic studies clearly demonstrate {{the importance of the}} regulation of Na+ absorption in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN), for the maintenance of the extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. Recent studies aiming at {{a better understanding of the}} cellular and molecular basis of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption in the distal part of nephron, have essentially focused on the regulation ENaC activity and on the aldosterone-signaling cascade. ENaC is a constitutively open channel, and factors controlling the number of active channels at the cell surface are likely to have profound effects on Na+ absorption in the ASDN, and in the amount of Na+ that is excreted in the final urine. A number of membrane-bound proteases, kinases, have recently been identified that increase ENaC activity at the cell surface in <b>heterologous</b> <b>expressions</b> systems. Ubiquitylation is a general process that regulates the stability of a variety of target proteins that include ENaC. Recently, deubiquitylating enzymes have been shown to increase ENaC activity in <b>heterologous</b> <b>expressions</b> systems. These regulatory mechanisms are likely to be nephron specific, since in vivo studies indicate that the adaptation of the renal excretion of Na+ in response to Na+ diet occurs predominantly in the early part (the connecting tubule) of the ASDN. An important work is presently done to determine in vivo the physiological relevance of these cellular and molecular mechanisms in regulation of ENaC activity. The contribution of the protease-dependent ENaC regulation in mediating Na+ absorption in the ASDN is still not clearly understood. The signaling pathway that involves ubiquitylation of ENaC does not seem to be absolutely required for the aldosterone-mediated control of ENaC. These in vivo physiological studies presently constitute a major challenge for our understanding of the regulation of ENaC to maintain the Na+ balance...|$|R
