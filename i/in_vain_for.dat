5|$|Thirteen {{thousand}} troops under General-Admiral Fyodor Apraksin {{marched to}} Viborg and laid siege on 22 March 1710. Magnus Stiernstråle, the Swedish commander at the fort, waited <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> Swedish assistance, while a stalemate ensued because the Russians lacked sufficient artillery. In April, Peter the Great managed to bring through {{a fleet of}} 250 ships to deliver guns and supplies, and to help perform a final assault on Swedish positions. After these Russian attacks, the Swedish garrison surrendered on 12 June 1710.|$|E
5|$|In October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian {{soldiers}} on Lissa while Hoste searched <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic. The island {{had been left}} in the command of two midshipmen, James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew {{the entire population of}} the island into the central mountains along with their supplies. The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, Port St. George. The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned. The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the third-rate ship of the line HMS Montagu.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E

5|$|Word of {{the attack}} at Spafford's farm spread quickly to Fort Defiance, about five miles {{southeast}} of Mineral Point. A small volunteer force of 13 men was assembled at Fort Defiance and they set off to hunt down the band of Native Americans responsible for the massacre. The group reached Fort Hamilton at around midnight on June 15. On the morning of June 15, survivor Bennett Million guided the militia volunteers back {{to the site of}} the massacre. One of the volunteers was Alexander Higgenbotham, a survivor of the St. Vrain massacre. The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated and Spafford's corpse was headless. His head was found scalped and tossed into the grass along the river bank. The volunteers buried the mangled bodies of the fallen and searched <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> Spencer, whom they also assumed dead.|$|E
5|$|In 977, as Bakhtiyar {{found himself}} driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he turned {{again to the}} Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed to support him in {{exchange}} for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but <b>in</b> <b>vain,</b> <b>for</b> Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 4 August the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were {{attacked}} at Romani. At 08:00, the regiment, {{acting as the}} brigade vanguard, advanced towards Dueidar; {{at the same time}} they could hear firing in the distance from Romani. By 10:30 they were approaching the Turkish position on Mount Royston, and the regiment opened out to attack, with the 8th Squadron positioned on the left, the 1st in the centre, and the 10th on the right, with the Auckland Mounted Rifles following in support. The 5th Light Horse Regiment, who were supposed to be to the left of the 8th Squadron, had not yet arrived. The assault commenced at 15:00, supported by the Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and by 17:30 they had driven the Turks off Mount Royston. The brigade captured an artillery battery and over 1,000 prisoners. The regiment's casualties during the battle were one dead and fifteen wounded. The next day at 03:30 they moved to Katia, which was believed to be occupied by a large Turkish force. On arrival, the brigade galloped forward, attacking from the south. When they got close the regiment dismounted and continued on foot. Fighting all day, they waited <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to support the assault. Still holding their ground at 20:00, they had to retire and return to Bir et Maler to water their horses. Their casualties were two dead and fifteen wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Aghlabids {{replaced}} Abu Fihr with al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, who displayed great energy: {{immediately after}} his arrival he led a raid against the environs of Syracuse, and then another into central Sicily, around Enna. The Byzantine strategos marched out to meet them, but the Muslims withdrew to a mountainous and thickly forested area where the Byzantines could not pursue. After waiting <b>in</b> <b>vain</b> <b>for</b> the Muslims to accept battle, the strategos turned his army back, but was ambushed by the Muslims who put his men to flight. The Muslims seized most of the Byzantines' arms, equipment and animals, and almost managed to capture the severely wounded strategos himself. Despite his success, Ibn Yaqub was replaced in September by a new governor, the Aghlabid prince Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim ibn Abdallah ibn al-Aghlab, a first cousin of the emir Ziyadat Allah. At the same time, the long-awaited Byzantine reinforcements arrived. The Byzantine fleet contested the passage of Abu'l-Aghlab's small fleet, which lost ships both to the Byzantine attack and to storms; the Byzantines however could not prevent it from reaching Palermo, and were driven off by a squadron from the city under Muhammad ibn al-Sindi. Abu'l-Aghlab avenged himself by launching naval raids against Pantelleria and other localities, beheading the Christians taken prisoner. At the same time, a Muslim cavalry raid reached the eastern parts of the island around Mount Etna, burning the villages and crops and taking captives.|$|E

25|$|The major flaw of {{this law}} was {{that it could be}} used only when the {{majority}} of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it.
