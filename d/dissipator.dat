The use of hysteretic energy <b>dissipators</b> for seismic protection of wide-beam buildings is proposed. This study focusses in 3 and 6 -story representative buildings; each building is designed for no, moderate and mid seismicity (design PGA 0. 0 g, 0. 12 g and 0. 23 g, respectively). The mechanical parameters of the <b>dissipators</b> are selected from two approaches: an algorithm aiming to obtain uniform cumulated plastic ductility along {{the height of the}} building and a simpler approach where the yielding forces of each dissipative device are chosen proportional to those induced by the equivalent static forces in the Spanish design code. The suitability of the proposed solutions is assessed through dynamic analyses for representative seismic records; the performance criteria are the reduction of the interstory drift, of the base shear, of the absolute accelerations, and of the cumulated plastic displacements in the structure and in the <b>dissipators.</b> Three cases are compared: bare frame (building without any bracing), protected frame (building with <b>dissipators)</b> and braced frame (building with rigid connections instead of <b>dissipators).</b> This research belongs to a wider initiative that includes testing and practical applications.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for solving the {{equations of motion}} of multi-storey buildings that incorporate frictional energy <b>dissipators</b> as seismic protection. The behavior of the <b>dissipators</b> is represented by Coulomb dry friction models; they introduce severe nonlinearities in the dynamic behavior of the structure every time that the contact conditions (stick or slip) change in the <b>dissipators.</b> These nonlinearities complicate {{the resolution of the}} equations of motion as it usually is described by lumped masses models whose degrees of freedom are the displacements of the floors and, as the stick or slip conditions change, the degrees of freedom must be modified: for blocking conditions they are only the displacements of the storeys while under sliding conditions the displacements of the <b>dissipators</b> have to be also considered. In previous articles the accuracy of the proposed algorithm has been verified by comparison with experimental results; as well, the computational efficiency of the algorithm has been confirmed by comparing the required resources (in terms of computation time and of memory allocation) with those of other algorithms. The objectives of this paper are to describe in detail the numerical solution of the equations of motion and present representative examples confirming the ability of the algorithm to reproduce the dynamic behavior of buildings with friction <b>dissipators</b> and reporting preliminarily about the usefulness of such devices to reduce the oscillations of the structure to be protected...|$|R
40|$|Energy <b>dissipators</b> are a {{convenient}} option for earthquake–resistant retrofitting of buildings; when a construction incorporating these systems is shaken {{by a strong}} ground motion, the devices absorb most of the damaging part of the input energy, thus protecting the main structure. Although energy <b>dissipators</b> have repeatedly proven their capacity to reduce the seismic response, {{one of the most}} controversial issues is their seismic efficiency under near–fault inputs. For this reason, this paper presents a numerical study about the seismic performance under near–source excitations of a structure retrofitted with hysteretic and with viscous devices. The considered structure is a symmetric 4 –story steel moment–resisting unbraced frame. This structure was tested at the E–defense laboratory (Japan) under a near–fault ground motion recorded in Takatori during the Kobe earthquake (16 / 01 / 1995); this input caused the collapse of the frame. In the paper the main characteristics of the frames are presented, the design of the energy <b>dissipators</b> is described, and the response of the frame with/without <b>dissipators</b> is shown. Finally, the possibilities of improving the behavior of a building with different kind of passive energy dissipating systems are analyzed in the conclusions. Postprint (published version...|$|R
