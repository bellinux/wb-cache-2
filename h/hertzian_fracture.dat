40|$|Grain‐scale brittle {{fracture}} and grain rearrangement {{play an important}} role in controlling the compaction behavior of reservoir rocks during the early stages of burial. Therefore, the understanding of single‐grain failure is important. We performed constant displacement rate crushing tests carried out on selected, well‐rounded, single sand grains and on randomly sampled grains from different grain size (d) batches of pure quartz sand. Applying a <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> mechanics model for grain crushing, the critical load at failure (Fc) data obtained for the selected grains were converted into an accurate estimate of the size of flaws associated with failure (cf). Similarly, the distributed Fc data obtained from the different batch samples were converted into distributions of grain failure stress. Weibull weakest link theory could not explain the observed grain failure behavior. On the contrary, the Hertzian grain failure criterion enabled the conversion of the distributed Fc data, for the batch samples, into distributions of cf, assuming spherical grains, or of “effective” radius of curvature (rg), characterizing contact surface asperities in the case of nonspherical grains. In contrast to the model of Zhang et al. (1990), our work shows that there is no clear physical basis for a grain size dependence of cf. However, since roundness data for dune sands exhibit a similar relation between rg and d, as seen in our grain size batches, it is inferred that the <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> mechanics model assuming nonspherical grains with a distributed rg is the most physically reasonable model for grain failure...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} Hertzian {{indentation}} to measure surface stresses on ceramics. Surface stresses in brittle materials {{have the effect}} of shifting the minimum load to produce <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture.</b> Quantitative use of the method requires knowledge only of the material's Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and its fracture toughness (or measurements from a stress-free specimen). We have used this method for surface stress measurements on Al 2 O 3 and soda lime float glass. Specimens of both types were stressed by bending. Our results are consistent with those obtained by other methods. The Hertzian technique thus provides a promising simple method for measuring surface residual stress in brittle materials.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} normal axisymmetric contact of dissimilar elastic solids at finite interfacial friction. It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} case of smooth and convex but otherwise arbitrary contact profiles and monotonically increasing loading a single stick-slip contour evolves being independent of loading and profile geometry. This allows developing an incremental procedure based on a reduced problem corresponding to frictional rigid flat punch indentation of an elastic half-space. The reduced problem, being independent of loading and contact region, was solved by a finite element method based on a stationary contact contour and characterized by high accuracy. Subsequently, a tailored cumulative superposition procedure was developed to resolve the original problem to determine global and local field values for two practically important geometries: flat and conical profiles with rounded edges and apices. Results are given for relations between force, depth and contact contours together with surface stress distributions and maximum von Mises effective stress, in particular to predict initiation of fracture and plastic flow. It is also observed that the presence of friction radically reduces the magnitude of the maximum surface tensile stress, thus retarding brittle fracture initiation. <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> through indentation of flat float glass specimens by steel balls has been examined experimentally for a full load cycle. It has been observed that if the specimen survived during loading to a maximum level it frequently failed at decreasing load. It has been proposed by Johnson et al. (1973) that the underlying physical cause of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation during load removal is that at unloading frictional tractions reverse their sign over part of the contact region. Guided by these considerations a robust computational procedure has been developed to determine global and local field values in particular at unloading at finite friction. In contrast to the situation at monotonically increasing loading, at unloading invariance properties are lost and stick-slip regions proved to be severely history dependent and in particular with an opposed frictional shear stress at the contact boundary region. This causes an increase of the maximum tensile stress at the contour under progressive unloading. It is shown that the experimental observations concerning <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation at unloading are at least in qualitative correlation with the effect friction has on the maximum surface tensile stress. A contact cycle between two dissimilar elastic bodies at finite Coulomb friction has been further investigated analytically and numerically for a wider range of material parameters and contact geometries. With the issue of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation in mind, results concerning the influence of the friction coefficient and compliance parameters on the absolute maximum surface tensile stress during a frictional contact cycle are reported along with the magnitudes of the relative increase of maximum tensile stresses at unloading. Based on a critical stress fracture criterion it is discussed how the predicted increases will influence the critical loads required for crack initiation. Fracture loads are measured with steel and tungsten carbide spherical indenters in contact with float glass specimens at monotonically increasing loading and during a load cycle. Computational predictions concerning the fracture loads are given based on Hertz and frictional contact theories combined with a critical stress fracture criterion. The computational results obtained for frictional contact are shown to be in better agreement with experimental findings as compared to the predictions based on the Hertz theory. The remaining quantitative discrepancy was attributed to the well-known fact that a Hertzian macro-crack initiates from pre-existing defects on the specimen’s surface. In order to account for the influence of the random distribution of these defects on the fracture loads at monotonic loading, Weibull statistics was introduced. The predicted critical loads corresponding to 50 % failure probability were found to be in close agreement with experimentally observed ones. QC 20100729 </p...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{it might}} not be agreed by all, natural {{phenomena}} which have been grouped with the Hertzian cone phenomena include the crescentic [...] "chatter marks" [...] made on smoothed bedrock by glacial ice dragging along boulders at its base, the numerous crescentic impact marks sometimes seen on pebbles and cobbles, and the shatter cones found at bolide impact sites. James Byous, working independently (at privately funded Dowd Research, Savannah, Georgia USA) has made a protracted study of Hertzian cones. Some of his work may be found via sharing points or directly at Dowd Research. [...] He has produced a comprehensive glossary on <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fractures</b> and related terms. A Hertzian cone is often 104 degrees when created by an indenter. Smaller cones may be produced due to lack of size of the material, or irregularities {{in the structure of the}} material. However, in ballistics the faster the projectile the steeper the edges and angle of the cone.|$|R
40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{irreversible}} deformation in otherwise brittle solids has been observed in Hertzian contacts. The deformation {{takes the form of}} a distributed damage zone below the contact circle, instead of the conventional <b>Hertzian</b> cone <b>fracture</b> outside. An important manifestation of the damage is an effective “quasi-ductility ” in the indentation stress–strain response. Control of the associated brittle–ductile transition is effected by incorporation of weak interfaces, large and elongate grains, and high internal stresses in the ceramic microstructure. Routes to micromechanical models of these processes, and ensuing implications concerning the prospective design of advanced flaw-tolerant and fatigue- and wear-resistant brittle materials, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{microstructural}} {{scale on}} deformation-micro-fracture damage induced by contact with spheres is investi-gated in monophase alumina ceramics over a range 3 - 48 pm in grain size. Measurement {{of a universal}} indentation stress-strain curve indicates a critical contact pressure- 5 GPa, above which irreversible deformation occurs in alu-mina. A novel sectioning technique identifies the deforma-tion elements as intragrain shear faults, predominantly crystallographic twins, within a confining subsurface zone of intense compression-shear stress. The twins concentrate the shear stresses at the grain boundaries and, above a threshold grain size, initiate tensile intergranular micro-cracks. Below this threshold size, classical <b>Hertzian</b> cone <b>fractures</b> initiate outside the contact circle. Above the threshold, the density and scale of subsurface-zone micro-cracks increase dramatically with increasing grain size, ulti-mately dominating the cone fractures. The damage process is stochastic, highlighting the microstructural discreteness of the initial deformation field; those grains which lie in the upper tail of the grain-size distribution and which have favorable crystallographic orientation relative to local shear stresses in the contact field are preferentially acti-vated. Initial flaw state is not an important factor, because the contact process creates its own flaw population. These and other generic features of the damage process will be dis-cussed in relation to microstructural design of polycrystal-line ceramics. I...|$|R
30|$|An {{unconventional}} {{method for}} determining the fracture resistance of brittle materials is discussed. This method employs a conical indenter to chip the rectangular edge of the specimen. Particular features of the method are the use of small specimens and {{the evaluation of the}} resistance of materials to the nucleation, initiation and propagation of a crack. It is shown that this method is somewhat similar to the <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> method and to the way that early man selected stones to make tools and weapons. Measured data of the fracture resistance of ceramics is presented. It is confirmed that if a ceramic material is similar to the model material of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), then those fracture resistance values are directly proportional to the critical stress intensity factors (baseline). For elastic and inelastic ceramics, R-lines characterizing the fracture resistance to crack growth are plotted. It is shown that proportionality lines (edge chipping resistance versus critical stress intensity factor) may be straight lines for ceramics with similar structure (such as Y-TZP and Mg-PSZ). The effect of rounding of the conical indenter tip (10 - 800 μm) on chip scar shape is indicated. Other aspects in the fracture behavior of ceramics during edge chipping are also analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed. Further studies in this mechanico-physical research area are suggested.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of indenter elasticity on <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation at frictional dissimilar elastic contact has been examined experimentally and numerically. In flat float glass specimens initiation of cone cracks {{has been observed}} and fracture loads measured with steel and tungsten carbide indenters at monotonically increasing loading and during a load cycle. The observed effect of indenter elasticity on fracture loads {{was found to be}} qualitatively different from the one predicted by the Hertz contact theory. This discrepancy may be explained by the presence of interfacial friction. The friction coefficient between the indenters and the specimen was measured and a contact cycle at finite Coulomb friction has been analyzed numerically. The {{influence of}} the indenter elasticity and the friction coefficient on the surface maximum tensile stress has been investigated and the results concerning the influence of these parameters on the fracture loads as given based on a critical stress fracture criterion. The obtained computational results were found to be in better agreement with experimental findings as compared to the predictions based on the frictionless contact theory.

40|$|Hertzian {{indentation}} {{has been}} used to determine the surface residual stress levels in brittle materials. In this method, a hard sphere is pressed into the surface of the material: at a critical load a preexisting surface-breaking crack in the neighborhood of the contact will propagate. There is a threshold load below which no such crack, of whatever size, can be propagated. The presence of a residual stress in the surface will lead to a shift in this threshold load. The effects of residual stresses on the minimum load to produce <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> are predicted for alumina and glass, assuming that the variation of the residual stress over the length of the crack is small. Two methods of analysis (one approximate, one more general) are presented that enable the residual stress to be calculated from the shift in threshold load; the only further information required is a knowledge of the radius of the sphere, the elastic constants of the sphere and substrate, and also the fracture toughness of the substrate (or use of a stress-free specimen as a reference). No measurement of any crack length is necessary. Experimental results are presented for the residual stress levels determined in glass strengthened by ion exchange. Indenting balls of a variety of materials with a range of elastic mismatch to the glass substrate were used, so as to evaluate the effects of elastic mismatch and interfacial frictional tractions on the results obtained. The results obtained by Hertzian indentation are consistent with residual stress levels determined by differential surface refractometry. We also present results on alumina specimens with induced surface stresses...|$|E
40|$|Burrs {{severely}} {{inhibit the}} performance and aesthetics in machined parts besides posing a safety risk to the user and manufacturer. Abrasive assisted brushing presents a fast and effective method for deburring these parts but is difficult to control. The dependence of deburring rate on the workpiece material, abrasive grit size, type and rotational speed of the brush is studied. It is found that deburring rate is proportional to initial burr height indicating fracture of the burr at the root. Deburring rate increases with spindle speed and is higher for diamond than SiC. The formation of burrs in micromilling of a thin nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol or NiTi) foil used in implantable biomedical device applications is analyzed {{as a function of}} micromilling process parameters such as spindle speed, feed, tool wear, backing material and adhesive used to attach the foil to the backing material. All factors except spindle speed are found to affect burr size. If initial penetration is sufficient to cause the foil to fail in tension, the foil tears with the crack starting closer to the upmilling side and thereby resulting in larger downmilling burrs. If penetration is insufficient, the foil plastically deforms until it tears typically {{in the middle of the}} cutter tooth path. A kinematic model that captures this behavior is used to predict burr widths and is verified through experiments. The thesis also presents an investigation of the abrasive impregnated brush deburring process for thin NiTi foils. Models based on <b>Hertzian</b> indentation and <b>fracture</b> mechanics are proposed to predict the rates of indentation and deburring during brushing and are validated using experiments. The predictions of the models are within the experimental variation. Burrs can be removed with this process within 12 minutes for a 6 mm long groove with no more than a micron change in foil thickness. Knowledge of burr formation and deburring is applied to a novel micromilled thin shape memory based NiTi foil device used for the surgical correction of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the western world in those over age 50. Burrs on the surface of the structure are used successfully to mechanically constrain and translocate an autograft to replace the diseased RPE-Bruch's membrane under the macula. The shape memory device is analyzed using experiments and simulations.

40|$|Abstract. When a brittle {{material}} is loaded by a blunt indenter a Hertzian cone crack may form in its surface. This crack weakens {{the material and}} can lead to material removal. In many practical situations a thin compliant coating may be applied either to deliberately reduce this type of damage or for some other reason (e. g. an anti-corrosion paint layer). This paper models abrasion and impact on the coated system by the contact of a rigid sphere. The results of simple analyses for the stresses within the coating are used to determine how the tensile stresses in the surface of the material, which would lead to <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> {{in the absence of the}} coating, are modified by the presence of the coating. The two extreme cases of rigid and zero adhesion of the coating to the substrate are directly compared. It is found that the stresses are most sensitive to the coating adhesion, Poisson’s ratio and thickness while the modulus of the coating material is only of secondary importance. It is shown that for optimum protection by the coating, it should be rigidly adhering to the substrate, that i t should be nearly incompressible (Poisson’s ratio> 0. 4) and that the coating thickness should be approximately 20 % of the radius of the contact between the coating and the sphere. These criteria allow a protective coating to be designed using theoretical argu-ments rather than to be developed empirically.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to find definitive evidence for impact in the geological record because there are many endogenous geological processes that can produce diamictites similar to those generated by impact ejecta. The classic impact criteria of shock fabrics in certain minerals, and iridium layers, for example, may be either difficult to find, or long-since erased from the impact site (shock fabrics also anneal with time). It is important to be able to recognize impact-generated materials in order to understand earth's crustal development and biological evolution. In future exploration of Mars and other solar-system bodies, recognition of impact materials will be important for elucidating planetary evolution, planetary volatile inventories, and exobiological issues. The cobble depicted is typical of many that have been found in diamictite deposits in Belize generated by the Chicxulub K-T impact event. The pebbles are roughly-hewn in general shape with smoothed corners and edges. Surfaces are almost uniformly frosted (on both protuberances and hollows), but some asperities are glazed. Optical microscopy and thin-section petrographic microscopy reveal the frosting to be only a few microns thick, with a well-defined granular structure; grains are the same size as those composing the bulk of the limestone, but their clearer appearance may represent annealing. One or two adjacent pebble faces are often decorated with striated gouges and closely-spaced hemispherical depressions representing indentation hollows produced by well-rounded impacting clasts of up to 0. 5 cm in diameter. Some of the impactors are still embedded in the cobble surface. Non-destructive x-ray diffraction techniques showed the impactors to be of the same mineralogy as the target cobble. We believe this unusual glazing and frosting {{to be related to the}} impact event, but this must be reconciled with its survival for over 60 my. since it is composed of one of the most alterable substances, CaCO 3. We focus, however, on the non-fractured rounded pebbles that appear to have impacted the larger cobble as a swarm of clasts, probably encountered during ballistic flight. It cannot be defined whether the cobble swept through the pebble cloud, or the pebbles rained upon a slowermoving cobble. Two interesting questions arise: (1) Where did large numbers of such well rounded pebbles come from in the ejecta curtain?, and (2) How did they embed themselves in a nominally brittle rock without suffering damage? Are the well-rounded pebbles crystalline (devitrified) melt spherules? Further investigations are in progress. If the cobble was cold and brittle, impact of well-rounded pebbles would have produced <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture</b> patterns (a) in the virtually elastically isotropic cobble target. For penetration depths of about 0. 5 of the impactor diameter, the pebbles would require a relative impact velocity sufficient to cause pebble fragmentation and crushing, and the development of a complex Hertzian-Boussinesq fracture field (b) involving deep fracturing and lateral surface spalling (impact velocities > 50 m/s). The existing relationship could only evolve by the impact of cold, hard pebbles into a soft, plastic cobble surface (c). For limestone to have been plastic, it must have been at elevated temperature, but to prevent calcification of the material, the ambient pressure must also have been elevated. This would be possible either in the impact's gas plume, or within the confines of a thin aerodynamically-produced shock bow generated by supersonic ballistic motion of the cobble. In the latter case, it is implied that the cobble swept through the pebbles rather than vice-versa. Although there are high T-P conditions associated with volcanism, such textures have not been reported on volcaniclastic materials, nor from other high T-P environments; e. g., metamorphic (as far as the authors are aware). We propose that this very easily recognizable embedding and indentation surface texture can be used as a diagnostic criterion for the recognition of impact ejecta. The term "peening texture" is suggested, because it is absolutely analogous to the plastic-deformation induced, metal-surface textures generated by ball-bearing bombardment used in engineering metallurgy to work-harden metal surfaces.

40|$|The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) experiment, an {{instrument}} suite to be flown on Mars Surveyor 2001, {{will include a}} tool for doing simple mineralogical scratch and streak tests on particles from the Martian regolith. The Abrasion Tool will be applied to particles that adhere themselves to highly polished substrates of various hardnesses. Granular soil components will be subjected to a compressive force of about 3 N using a leaf spring. The spring will be applied with a paraffin actuator capable of a 0. 76 mm throw to achieve a maximum displacement of about 7. 5 mm {{at the tip of}} the tool. The pressure per grain will be dependent on the grain size, the number of grains that adhere to the substrate and the number of grains in compression. The pressure per particle is expected to be on the order of 100 MPa - 1 GPa. The MECA sample wheel containing the substrates will be rotated after the particles are placed in compression to produce scratches or pits. A primary goal of the Abrasion Tool is to identify quartz (Mohs' hardness = 7) using substrates of varying hardnesses. Quartz is considered hazardous to future human explorers of Mars because it can cause silicosis of the lungs if it is of respirable size. It is also hazardous to machinery, structures, and space suits because of its ability to abrade and scratch surfaces. Since large quantities of minerals harder than quartz are not expected, any scratches produced on polished quartz substrates might be reasonably attributed to quartz particles, although there may be minerals such as impact metamorphic diamond in the soils. Careful calibration of the tool will be necessary to ensure that grains are not overloaded; for example, a steel ball pressed into glass will produce a <b>Hertzian</b> <b>fracture,</b> even though it is softer than glass. Other minerals, such as magnetite (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5) have been shown to scratch glass ceramics such as Zerodur (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5). Thus, minerals can be differentiated: note that regardless of the mineral species, if any particle is harder than 6. 5 it will certainly be an interesting discovery for both planetary geology and human exploration concerns. The scratches will be identified using the 6 X optical microscope and profiled with the atomic force microscope included in the MECA instrument suite. Analysis of the scratch morphology will yield evidence concerning the shape of the particle responsible for producing each scratch. For example, angular grains should leave vertical cracks with microconchoidal lateral chipping, while rounded grains might leave chatter marks, or nested partial Hertzian cracks. Particle shape can thus be inferred from these indentation modes, as well as material hardness. In addition, particle size information may also be available if pits caused by rolling particles can be identified. Converse to scratching, the minerals may be crushed at their contact points, and be smeared onto the target substrates to leave what geologists refer to as "streaks". These are cold-welded trails of mineral material that have structure and color indicative of mineral composition. The AFM will determine the morphology of these streaks, while the microscope will ascertain the color. On the harder substrates, we might expect streaking to dominate; on the softer substrates, scratching may dominate. Progressions of material interactions across the substrate selection will be a valuable source of data for mineral discrimination. It should also be noted that many minerals have coatings (such as iron oxides), and these will have to be differentiated from the host mineral grains; laboratory tests will establish the effects of such coatings on the scratch results. Finally, we note that the microscope will provide corroborative data regarding likely mineral species by grain shapes, fracture patterns, surface textures, color, and UV fluorescence reactions.
