25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|One of the U.S. Labor Party's {{strategies}} {{focused on}} disrupting other left-wing groups, with questionable success. William Chapman wrote in The Washington Post in September 1976 that several public {{figures on the}} left had reported threats and intimidation, and said those responsible had identified themselves as members of LaRouche's NCLC or U.S. Labor Party. The linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky was accused of working for the CIA and being a tool of the Rockefellers; meetings he addressed were disrupted, and threats were made. The philosopher Paul Kurtz, editor of The Humanist, was asked during his lectures at the State University of New York why he was practicing genocide. According to Chapman, sociologists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, specialists on urban poverty, were followed around the country having their speaking tours disrupted. Environmentalist Lester Brown was accused of genocide and told he would be hanged from a lamppost. LaRouche was asked how he expected a party with a five-year record of harassment and threats to win the election; he did not deny the incidents, but replied, [...] "We are only engaged in an open political attack. We just want to challenge them in debate." [...] He denied however that anyone had been threatened with physical harm: [...] "Sure, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> – but politically." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in 2007, Gibson bowled Durham to victory, again against Hampshire, in the Friends Provident Trophy. After setting 312 to win, with Gibson smashing fifteen {{off just}} seven balls, the Dynamos bowled out the Hawks for just 187. Gibson had Michael Lumb and Sean Ervine caught by Michael Di Venuto {{first and second}} ball of the innings respectively, both for 0. He then had Kevin Pietersen out lbw for 12 to leave Hampshire 17-3, {{finishing}} with figures of 3-24. He picked up the Player of the Match award for his efforts. Gibson remarked after the game, [...] "Unbelievable.

5000|$|In December 2001, Berntsen {{served as}} the Commander of all CIA forces in Eastern Afghanistan and led the agency’s Jawbreaker team in Tora Bora.

[...] "We are {{certainly}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> and I {{think that we}} {{have a good chance of}} doing so. Much will depend, of course, upon whether we can reach the hut where they are confined before being discovered. You see, we have only twenty-five men, or, counting us all, including the quarter-master, steward, and cook, thirty-one. It is a small force, and though we might bring all the prisoners off in safety if we once got them into our hands, it would be a serious thing if the negroes had time to rally round the hut before we got there. How does it stand, is it surrounded by trees?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I, so do I," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Haswell, [...] "and {{of course}} we have acted against his advice throughout, which must have been annoying to him.

We want millions and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> Well, he is coming to The Court to-morrow, and perhaps after all we shall be able to arrange matters.

6000|$|Also, in {{the first}} {{fortnight}} of his stay, he had called at every house, alike in Downhill and Uphill, to the great surprise {{of some of the}} families, who had not in the memory of man seen a parson cross their threshold. Some did not like it, such as old Dame Verdon, who, though she could hardly get out of bed, was very sore about the new school; and when her friends came to see her, told them wonderful stories which she had picked up--or Lizzie had from some hawker--that the gentlefolks thought there were too many children for the rates and taxes, and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> all into the school, and make an end of them. Sometimes she said it was by [...] "giving of them all the cowpox," [...] as Dame Spurrell called vaccination as the fashion was in those parts, sometimes it was by sending them all out to Botany Bay.|$|E

You're concentrated by nature, and so you can't feel what a glorious pang {{it is to be}} fixed to one spot like a butterfly with a pin through you. I don't see how I ever lived without the Synthesis. I'm going to have a wolf-hound--as soon as I can get a good-tempered one that the man can lead out in the Park for exercise--to curl up here in front of the fire; and I'm going to have foils and masks over the chimney. As soon as I'm a member of the Synthesis I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to let me be one of the monitors: that'll concentrate me, if anything will, keeping the rest in order, and I can get a lot of ideas from posing the model; don't you think so?

I think that if you were to describe this recruiting class, they are a big, athletic bunch of athletes who can run and hit. They are also good students. I am really putting an emphasis on guys who can be successful in life, and who have goals that they want to achieve... We have 15 local-area players. There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all of <b>them.</b> We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{film is a}} Crown Film Unit {{production}} called Seaman Frank Goes Back to Sea {{which shows}} Frank patriotically re-enlisting for the Merchant Navy; the narrator calls him a [...] "real Englishman" [...] who does his duty. In another clip for British Pathé, in 1941, Laskier {{says he wants to}} go out fighting again (re-enlist) to avenge the deaths of his friends, while the romantic interest with [...] "Mary" [...] would have to wait.

After that I shall go to the bad for a few weeks; and I'll have to scramble back the best way I can. Nobody can help me. That was the mistake this last time. I shouldn't have wanted anything at Gibraltar if I could have had my spree out at Boston. But I let them take me before it was over, and ship me off. I thought I'd try it. Well, {{it was like a}} burning fire every minute, all the way. I thought I should die. I tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something from the sailors; I tried to steal Gabriel's cooking-wine. When I got that brandy in Gibraltar I was wild. Talk about heroism! I tell you it was superhuman, keeping that canteen corked till night! I was in hopes I could get through it,--sleep it off,--and nobody be any the wiser. But it wouldn't work. O Lord, Lord, Lord!" ...|$|R

50|$|With 3 years gone since Town's relegation from Division 2, some Town {{fans were}} {{beginning}} to wonder if Eoin Hand was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> promoted. Phil Starbuck was brought in from Nottingham Forest and he helped bring in the goals along with Iffy Onuora and Iwan Roberts. Town made a fairly good start to the season, with only one loss in their first 9 games. Form was intermittent with losses and wins more often than not.

Shekhar, realising that there is no alternative, grabs Ansari and tries to hand him over, but Anant stands in his way.

50|$|The Keltans {{turn to the}} Doctor for ideas, but he says {{he needs}} more time to think.

Lucie starts to argue with her, but to everyone’s surprise, Selta grabs hold of her and agrees with the Headhunter, assuring Yanos they have no alternative. Lucie bites her captor and is released, then the Doctor hands Selta his sonic {{screwdriver}} for protection and tells her to meet with the Molluscari and keep them talking as long as she can. Once the Keltans have gone, Lucie tries to punch the Headhunter - but the woman pulls out her gun and shoots her again at point blank range.|$|R
