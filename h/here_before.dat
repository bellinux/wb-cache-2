25|$|Rome {{was built}} at the {{confluence}} of the Etowah and the Oostanaula rivers, forming the Coosa River. Because of its strategic advantages, this area was long occupied by the Creek and later the Cherokee people.

25|$|St. James' Gate in Dublin was {{traditionally}} a main {{starting point}} for Irish pilgrims to begin their journey on the Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James). The pilgrims' passports were stamped <b>here</b> <b>before</b> setting sail, usually for A Coruña, north of Santiago. It is still possible for Irish pilgrims to get these traditional documents stamped both at Guinness Storehouse and St James' Church, and many do, while {{on their way to}} Santiago de Compostela.|$|E
25|$|Stade Pierre-Mauroy {{was inaugurated}} in 2012. Originally named the Centre Olympique de Lille Est, the club's {{sporting}} venue is spread over five hectares and features three natural grass football pitches and one synthetic pitch, {{as well as}} a number of buildings including a medical centre and gymnasium. These attributes had seen the club house part of the LOSC Youth Academy <b>here,</b> <b>before</b> all the club's operations were moved to the Domaine de Luchin in Camphin-en-Pé.|$|E
25|$|Frida died on {{the upper}} floor of this house on 13 July 1954 {{at the age of}} 47. Her wake took place <b>here</b> <b>before</b> the body was taken to the Palacio de Bellas Artes then cremated. Four years after her death, in 1958, Rivera donated the house to the nation of Mexico and set up a {{foundation}} for its preservation. The house was converted to a museum dedicated to the life and works of Kahlo. The first director of the museum was Carlos Pellicer with the mandate to keep the house as it was.|$|E

25|$|Vasilije Trbić {{was born}} in 1881 in the Slavonian village of Bijelo Brdo, near Dalj. He {{completed}} his early schooling <b>here</b> <b>before</b> continuing his education in the Kingdom of Serbia. A monk in his youth, Trbić was forced to flee Mount Athos in 1902 after being charged with murdering several Greek monks. He found sanctuary in Belgrade, where he met several Serbian nationalist leaders who convinced him to join their Chetnik bands. In 1903, Trbić murdered a Turk near the Pčinja River. He was caught {{and sentenced to death}} by Ottoman Turkish authorities before being pardoned for his crime.|$|E
25|$|Violation of the {{principle}} of locality, which contradicts special relativity: MWI splitting is instant and total: this may conflict with relativity, since an alien in the Andromeda galaxy can't know I collapse an electron over <b>here</b> <b>before</b> she collapses hers there: the relativity of simultaneity says we can't say which electron collapsed first – so which one splits off another universe first? This leads to a hopeless muddle with everyone splitting differently. Note: EPR is not a get-out here, as the alien's and my electrons need never {{have been part of the}} same quantum, i.e., entangled.|$|E
25|$|In February 1912 Thomas Sopwith {{opened his}} flying {{school and in}} June, with several others, he set up the Sopwith Aviation Company there, {{although}} their manufacturing premises were at Kingston upon Thames. Other aviation pioneers came to Brooklands before World War One including Prince Serge de Bolotoff who tried to build a large tandem triplane in a shed there in 1913. Blériot, Martinsyde and Vickers also later produced military aeroplanes at Brooklands which became Britain's largest aircraft manufacturing centre by 1918. Many flying schools operated <b>here</b> <b>before</b> 1914 and the aerodrome became a major flying training centre between the wars.|$|E

25|$|Later it was {{occupied}} by the Tabacalera Mexicana Company, a tobacco company, with workers living around it. This factory would give the colonia its name. In the 1940s, the National Lottery occupied it in part and held drawings <b>here,</b> <b>before</b> moving to its current location at Rosales Street and Avendia Del Ejido. The building was than a preparatory school. In 1986, it was converted into the current museum, which exhibits European art from the 14th to 20th centuries. It also holds temporary exhibits such as the collection of works by Francisco de Zurbarán, a contemporary of Diego Velázquez.|$|E
25|$|Richard Abanes {{argues that}} {{polygamy}} {{may have caused}} a shortage of brides in the early Mormon community. The New York Times reported in 1860 that apostle Heber C. Kimball stated (in an address to departing missionaries): Brethren, I {{want you to understand}} that it is not to be as it has been heretofore. The brother missionaries have been in the habit of picking out the prettiest women for themselves before they get here, and bringing on the ugly ones for us; hereafter you have to bring them all <b>here</b> <b>before</b> taking any of them, and let us all have a fair shake.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{by many to}} be Belfast's finest {{architectural}} feature, Lanyon {{designed the}} Custom House in 1857. Built in the Italian Renaissance style, the building features carved statues of Britannia, Neptune and Mercury. Until the 1950s the steps of the building served as Belfast's Speaker's Corner. It was here that trade union leader James Larkin addressed crowds of up to 20,000 people during the 1907 Belfast Dock strike. The writer Anthony Trollope was employed <b>here</b> <b>before</b> finding fame. Today Customs House Square and the adjoining Queen's Square are Belfast City Centre's main venue for free concerts and public events. McHugh's Bar and The Albert Clock are also located here.|$|E

25|$|During its {{period as}} part of Brooklyn's Eastern District, the area {{achieved}} remarkable industrial, cultural, and economic growth, and local businesses thrived. Wealthy New Yorkers such as Cornelius Vanderbilt and railroad magnate Jubilee Jim Fisk built shore-side mansions. Charles Pratt and his family founded the Pratt Institute, the great school of art & architecture, and the Astral Oil Works, which later became part of Standard Oil. Corning Glass Works was founded <b>here</b> <b>before</b> moving upstate to Corning, New York. German immigrant, chemist Charles Pfizer founded Pfizer Pharmaceutical in Williamsburg, and the company maintained an industrial plant in the neighborhood through 2007, although its headquarters were moved to Manhattan in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved <b>here</b> <b>before</b> you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E
25|$|Thornfield, {{the estate}} of famed {{abolitionist}} and Quaker Thomas Garrett, lies on Garrett Road (named for his family, who were among the earliest settlers of {{that part of the}} township) and Maple Avenue in Drexel Hill. Garrett resided <b>here</b> <b>before</b> 1822 and would later work as a station master in Wilmington, Delaware, the last stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1956, the Thornfield estate was purchased by Caroline and Walter Isard, active Quakers who moved to the area when Walter founded the Regional Science department at the University of Pennsylvania. Caroline went on to found the Fair Housing Council of Suburban Philadelphia together with other concerned citizens in the area. As of 2014, the estate is owned by Randi T. Rioux. It is currently undergoing restoration, along with renovations necessary to preserve its history and allow for modern capabilities.|$|E
