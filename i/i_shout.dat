Richards himself {{said in a}} 1998 interview: [...] "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If <b>I</b> <b>shout</b> and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done." ...|$|E

Brezianu recalls that Vulcănescu [...] "grabbed Sandu Tudor by the collar", then slapped him. The incidents disgraced both sides. Stancu's gossip column introduced the infamous homophobic taunt cavaleri de Curlanda ("Knights of Courland", with a pun on the word cur, [...] "ass"). With Comarnescu and Negri in mind, Tudor himself wrote: [...] "Only now do we get to see all the pestilent buggery in their unfulfilled, masturbating, inverted souls. <b>I</b> <b>shout</b> for all to hear, I address this thirty-year-some non-generation: avast! thou tricksters, though barren and vicious ones, thou that are rotten to the core, mediocre and neurotic". According to Ornea: [...] "The strange fact is that Sandu Tudor, a religious poet and trained theologian , could stoop down to the level of such inurbane attacks".|$|E

He make faces against me and again he make faces against me, and the more I command that he should get to hell out of here, the more he do not get to hell out of here. He cry something towards me, and I demand what is his desire, but he do not explain. Oh, no, that arrives never. He does but shrug his head. What damn silliness! Is this amusing for me? You think I like it? I am not content with such folly. I think the poor mutt's loony. Je me fiche de ce type infect. C'est idiot de faire comme ça l'oiseau.... Allez-vous-en, louffier....

And, hooray! here's Dick coming out of his enormous mouth, all in armour set with sharp spikes, and a sword in his hand. He's covered with blood, but he's well and hearty. He must have been swallowed by the brute, and cut him up inside. Now he's cutting the beast's head off. Now he's gone to the princess; a very neat bow he has made her. Dick's manners are positively improving! Now he's cutting her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness. And now he's made her another bow, and he's actually taking leave of her. Poor thing! How disappointed she is looking. And she's so pretty, too. I say, Rosalind, shall <b>I</b> <b>shout</b> to him through the magic horn, and tell him to bring her home here, on the magic carpet?" ...|$|E

60|$|And, after all, {{can such}} {{philosophy}} be true? Methinks I {{could find a}} thousand arguments against it. Well, then, let yonder shaggy rock mid-deep in the surf--see! he is somewhat wrathful: he rages and roars and foams,--let that tall rock be my antagonist, and let me exercise my oratory like him of Athens who bandied words with an angry sea and got the victory. My maiden-speech is a triumphant one, for the gentleman in seaweed has nothing to offer in reply save an immitigable roaring. His voice, indeed, will be heard a long while after mine is hushed. Once more <b>I</b> <b>shout</b> and the cliffs reverberate the sound. Oh what joy for a shy man to feel himself so solitary that he may lift his voice to its highest pitch without hazard of a listener!--But hush! Be silent, my good friend! Whence comes that stifled laughter? It was musical, but how should there be such music in my solitude? Looking upward, I {{catch a glimpse of}} three faces peeping from the summit of the cliff like angels between me and their native sky.--Ah, fair girls! you may make yourself merry at my eloquence, but {{it was my turn to}} smile when I saw your white feet in the pool. Let us keep each other's secrets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at {{any rate}} you must give up all idea of making a raid on this still, Mr. Fitzgibbon. That has become a {{secondary}} object altogether now. What {{we have to do}} is to find our way out of this. Hitherto I have tried what we could do in silence. Now I shall give that up. Now, sergeant, get the men together again. I will go ahead, and shall, if I can, keep on descending. If one does that one must get out of these hills at last. When I get about fifty yards I will shout. Then you send a man on to me. When he reaches me I will shout again and go on another fifty yards. When <b>I</b> <b>shout</b> send another man forward. When he gets to the first man the first man is to shout and then come on to me, and you send off another. In that way we shall make a regular line fifty yards apart, and I don't think any one can get lost. Should any one get confused and stray, which he can't do if he keeps his head, he must shout till he hears his shouts answered. After a time if he doesn't hear any answer he must fire his gun, and we must answer till he rejoins us. But if my orders are observed I do not see how any one can miss their way, as there will be posts stationed every fifty yards. You remain till the last and see them all before you. You quite understand? When each man comes up to the one in front of him he is to stop until the next man joins him, and then move on to the man ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy {{was used}} to such visits at all times of night of day. Men succeeded one another. They spoke in clear voices, {{pronounced}} cheerful words, repeated old jokes, listened to him; and each, going out, seemed to leave behind a little of his own vitality, surrender {{some of his own}} strength, renew the assurance of life--the indestructible thing! He did not like to be alone in his cabin, because, when he was alone, it seemed to him as if he hadn't been there at all. There was nothing. No pain. Not now. Perfectly right--but he couldn't enjoy his healthful repose unless some one was by to see it. This man would do as well as anybody. Donkin watched him stealthily:--"Soon home now," [...] observed Wait.--"Vy d'yer whisper?" [...] asked Donkin with interest, [...] "can't yer speak up?" [...] Jimmy looked annoyed and said nothing for a while; then in a lifeless, unringing voice:--"Why should <b>I</b> <b>shout?</b> You ain't deaf that I know."--"Oh! I can 'ear right enough," [...] answered Donkin in a low tone, and looked down. He was thinking sadly of going out when Jimmy spoke again.--"Time we did get home... to get something decent to eat... I am always hungry." [...] Donkin felt angry all of a sudden.--"What about me," [...] he hissed, [...] "I am 'ungry too an' got ter work. You, 'ungry!"--"Your work won't kill you," [...] commented Wait, feebly; [...] "there's a couple of biscuits in the lower bunk there--you may have one. I can't eat them." [...] Donkin dived in, groped in the corner and when he came up again his mouth was full. He munched with ardour. Jimmy seemed to doze with open eyes. Donkin finished his hard bread and got up.--"You're not going?" [...] asked Jimmy, staring at the ceiling.--"No," [...] said Donkin, impulsively, and instead of going out leaned his back against the closed door. He looked at James Wait, and saw him long, lean, dried up, as though all his flesh had shrivelled on his bones in the heat of a white furnace; the meagre fingers of one hand moved lightly upon the edge of the bunk playing an endless tune. To look at him was irritating and fatiguing; he could last like this for days; he was outrageous--belonging wholly neither to death nor life, and perfectly invulnerable in his apparent ignorance of both. Donkin felt tempted to enlighten him.--"What are yer thinkin' of?" [...] he asked, surlily. James Wait had a grimacing smile that passed over the deathlike impassiveness of his bony face, incredible and frightful as would, in a dream, have been the sudden smile of a corpse.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shouted</b> to him. He took no notice. <b>I</b> <b>shouted</b> again, {{and he only}} {{increased}} his pace. I watched him disappear, and I no longer had any doubts at all. He {{was not in the}} least like a tramp, and his flight could bear but one interpretation. Isobel was not safe even here. We had been followed from London--we were being watched every hour.

[...] and altogether <b>I</b> <b>shouted</b> [...] "Another pigeon!" [...] about five times, and by that time he was in a quite furious temper. [...] "Rats--rats!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "killing all these pigeons and dragging them up here just to put them away in empty barrels--who ever heard of such a thing!" [...] No stronger language did he use. Like the vicar's wonderfully sober-minded daughter, as described by Marjory Fleming, [...] "he never said a single dam," [...] for that was the sort of man he was, but he went back fuming to his boxes.|$|R
