Nina Terrero for NBC Latino compared the video for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] to Aguilera's previous video for [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002) for the same positive portrayal of the LGBT community.|$|E

2500|$|Chris Tookey of the Daily Mail {{was also}} {{impressed}} {{and described the}} film as [...] "delightful and endearing", awarding four stars out of five. He wrote, [...] "For the young, this is a worthwhile cautionary tale.

New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the {{sponsoring}} organizations, he wrote, [...] "have long been connected with Communist activities." [...] Hellman replied: [...] "I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves." [...] She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: [...] "I am sure <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Friday" [...] was {{revealed}} as YouTube's No. 1 video of 2011, with Black hosting a short video called [...] "YouTube Rewind" [...] in the year-end recap. Despite the over 167 million views {{during its first}} four months, prior to its temporary removal, [...] "Friday" [...] had amassed more than 3,190,000 [...] "dislikes". After the fallout with Ark Music Factory, Black started an independent record label named RB Records. She released a self-produced single titled [...] "My Moment" [...] on July 18, 2011, the first on her label, with an accompanying music video published to her YouTube channel the same day. In the video, director Morgan Lawley features real life footage of Black from {{both before and after}} her fame. In late October 2011, production began on the music video for Black's third single, [...] "Person of Interest". About the song, Black stated [...] "The basis of it is that it's a love song but it's not a love song. It's about almost teenage crushes – when you're not in love yet but you really like a guy – which I'm really excited about because I don't think there are too many out like that. It's very much a dance type song. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> get up and dance and sing along in your car." [...] The single and its accompanying music video were released on November 15, 2011. Black released two more singles in 2012: [...] "Sing It" [...] in May, and [...] "In Your Words" [...] in November. Black was planning to release her debut album in late 2011, which she said would include [...] "a bunch of different kinds of stuff." [...] The album was being recorded at a studio belonging to music producer Charlton Pettus. However, the album was never released. Black was featured in an ABC Primetime Nightline: Celebrity Secrets special entitled Underage and Famous: Inside Child Stars' Lives.|$|E
