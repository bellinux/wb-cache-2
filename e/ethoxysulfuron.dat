40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of herbicide <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> on the development of commom bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), to evaluate the impact of the herbicide on the crop grain yield and to determine the mechanism of tolerance of common bean to <b>ethoxysulfuron.</b> Field experiments were carried out with several doses of <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> to determine its effect on the grain yield of two varieties of common bean ("IPR Andorinha", "IPR Tangará"). The mechanism of plant tolerance was evaluated through several methods, including the analysis of the ALS enzyme sensitivity to herbicide and the use of P 450 inhibitors (the insecticides malathion + chlorpyrifos) and the use of antidote (mefenpyr-diethyl). When the rate of <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> was 83. 2 g ha- 1, the grain yield loss reached 25 % (IPR Tangará) and 35 % (IPR Andorinha). The ALS enzyme activity was severely reduced even at low concentrations <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> (1 &# 956;M), indicating that the mechanism of tolerance is not the insensitivity of the herbicide target enzyme. The inhibitors of herbicide detoxification increased the sensitivity of the bean plants to <b>ethoxysulfuron,</b> and the antidote (stimulator of herbicide degradation) mitigated the herbicidal effect. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the mechanism of tolerance of common bean plants to <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> is enhanced herbicide detoxification...|$|E

40|$|Dry-seeded rice {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} puddled hand-transplanted rice in the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. In dry-seeded rice, weed flora tends to be more diverse and weeds emerge in several flushes during the crop growth cycle and substantial yield reductions due to weed competition are quite common. The efficacy and compatibility of tank mixtures of different herbicides for the control of diverse weed flora in dry-seeded rice was evaluated in field experiments during the summer seasons of 2012 and 2013. The tank mixture of fenoxaprop with <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> improved the control of Echinochloa crus-galli and Echinochloa colona by 43 - 69 % as compared to fenoxaprop alone while the tank-mix of azimsulfuron with fenoxaprop was antagonistic and reduced the control of Leptochloa chinensis by 86 % as compared to fenoxaprop alone. Addition of azimsulfuron or <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> to bispyribac did not improve the control of grass weeds as compared to bispyribac alone. Weed control with the mixture of bispyribac and fenoxaprop varied over the two years. In 2012, bispyribac and fenoxaprop mixture was antagonistic for the control of Dactyloctenum aegyptium, Acrachne racemose, and L. chinensis but in 2013, there was no apparent antagonism and the addition of bispyribac to fenoxaprop reduced grass weed biomass as compared to fenoxaprop alone. In 2013, there was a strong negative correlation (r = - 0. 95, P < 0. 001) between weed dry matter at 45 days after sowing and rice grain yield. According to the linear regression, rice crop is likely to produce no grain yield when weed dry matter exceeds 400 g m. Over the two seasons, fenoxaprop-ethoxysulfuron tank-mix produced similar grain yields (5. 6 - 6. 2 t ha) to the weed-free check (5. 6 - 7. 1 t ha). At the farmer fields, rice grain yield in the plots treated with pendimethalin followed by post-emergence bispyribac or a tank-mix of fenoxaprop + <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> ranged from 6. 2 to 7. 7 t ha as compared to 5. 3 - 5. 6 t ha in the plots treated with pendimethalin alone.

A field study was conducted in 2012 and 2013 at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Baños, Philippines, to evaluate the performance of sole and sequential applications of preemergence (oxadiazon and pendimethalin), early postemergence (butachlor + propanil and thiobencarb + 2, 4 -D), and late postemergence herbicides (bispyribac-sodium and fenoxaprop + <b>ethoxysulfuron)</b> with different modes of action in comparison to manual weeding in DSR. The sequential applications of all preemergence and postemergence herbicides reduced weed density and biomass by 80 – 100 % compared to the nontreated plots. The sole application of postemergence herbicides reduced weed density by only 44 – 54 % and weed biomass by 51 – 61 %, whereas oxadiazon alone reduced weed density and biomass by 96 – 100 %. All herbicide treatments and manual weeding significantly affected tiller number, biomass, crop growth rate, agronomic indices, yield-contributing parameters (panicle density and filled grains), and yield (biological and grain) of rice.

Visual evaluations of phytotoxicity on crambe plants were realized after applications, the seedlings were counted and the height and plant dry matter were determined in the end of the evaluation period. In conditions where the studies were conducted, we can conclude that only the trifluralin application in PRE and the application of clefoxidim+fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, fluazifop-p-butyl, quinclorac, setoxydim and clefoxydim in POST showed selectivity and potential use for FMS Brilhante crambe cultivar...|$|E

A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2012 and dry season of 2013 to evaluate the performance of five rice establishment methods and four weed control treatments on weed management, and rice yield. Grass weeds were higher in dry-seeded rice (DSR) as compared to PTR and nonpuddled transplanted rice (NPTR). The highest total weed density (225 - 256 plantsm- 2) and total weed biomass (315 - 501 gm- 2) were recorded in DSR while the lowest (102 - 129 plantsm- 2 and 75 - 387 gm- 2) in PTR. Compared with the weedy plots, the treatment pretilachlor followed by fenoxaprop plus <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> plus 2, 4 -D provided excellent weed control. This treatment, however, had a poor performance in NPTR. In both seasons, herbicide efficacy was better in DSR and wet-seeded rice. PTR and DSR produced the maximum rice grain yields. The weed-free plots and herbicide treatments produced 84 - 614 % and 58 - 504 % higher rice grain yield, respectively, than the weedy plots in 2012, and a similar trend was observed in 2013...|$|E

The demand for corn is increasing in Asia for feed and biofuel. It is grown in the rice-corn cropping system. During harvest of corn, however, seeds drop on the soil surface and become problems as volunteer corn seedlings in the subse-quent dry-seeded rice crop, in which the suppressive effect of standing water is absent. A {{study was conducted in}} screenhouse and field conditions to evaluate the effect of rice herbicides on the management of volunteer corn seedlings. In the screenhouse experiment, bispyribac-sodium at 0. 030 and 0. 045 kg·ai·ha− 1 provided complete control of corn seedlings. Fenoxaprop + <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> and penoxsulam + cyhalofop did not provide effective control of corn seed-lings. In the field, the sole application of bispyribac and sequential application of oxadiazon and bispyribac suppressed corn biomass by 60 %- 82 % and 89 %- 91 %, respectively, as compared with the nontreated control.

All herbicide treatments with PRE or early POST herbicides reduced total weed density by 85 - 100 % and biomass by 80 - 100 %, whereas late POST treatments reduced weed density by 32 - 50 % and biomass by 40 - 62 % compared with the nontreated weedy check. The highest grain yield was achieved in weed-free plots (5. 9 - 6. 1 t ha) and the lowest in weedy plots (0. 2 t ha). Among the herbicide treatments, rice treated with oxadiazon, thiobencarb plus 2, 4 -D, and butachlor plus propanil followed by the late POST herbicides had grain yield increments of 23 - 25, 20 to 26, and 18 to 23 times that of the yield in weedy plots, respectively.

Thus, studies with advanced oxidation processes are expanding and can determine the rate constant of the hydroxyl radical with organic compounds of great importance in environmental contamination. In this context, the use of laser flash photolysis {{has been shown to be}} viable for the determination of these constants. The reaction rate constants of different pesticides with HO(•) in degassed acetonitrile have been determined.

These values are about an order of magnitude smaller than the diffusion controlled rate and correlate with the relative rates of disappearance of the pesticides in the photo-Fenton reaction in water. The correlation of the relative rate constants determined by laser flash photolysis with the relative rates of photo-Fenton degradation of the pesticides is compelling evidence for the participation of the hydroxyl radical in the degradation of these pesticides in the latter system. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work was to validate a chromatographic method to determine herbicides commonly applied in the irrigated rice farming. For this, matrix-matched calibration was employed along with the extraction and clean-up of the samples by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method and determination of the analytes by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization in the positive mode. By this method, {{it was possible to}} achieve the ionization and detection of a total of 18 herbicides, with quantification of 12 of them. The method presented adequate precision and accuracy according to the European Commission and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines for analytes in low concentrations. The limits of quantification ranged from 0. 015 &# 956;g g- 1 for oxadiazon to 0. 165 &# 956;g g- 1 for imazapyr. The method showed good linearity with R 2 > 0. 99 and recovery values from 92 to 103 %.

40|$|Background. Herbicides are {{commonly}} ingested for self-harm, but relatively {{little has been}} published on poisoning with herbicides other than paraquat and glyphosate. We report here a case series of patients with acute exposure to a combination herbicide (brand name Tiller Gold or Whip Super) containing the selective phenoxy herbicide compounds fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> and a safener isoxadifen ethyl. Method. Clinical data on all patients presenting with Tiller Gold or Whip Super poisoning to two General Hospitals in Sri Lanka from 2002 - 2008 were collected prospectively until discharge. Results. Eighty-six patients {{with a history of}} Tiller Gold or Whip Super ingestion were included. The main clinical features were an epigastric burning sensation and vomiting; however, most of those who vomited had received gastric lavage or forced emesis. Eight patients had a reduced level of consciousness on admission (Glasgow coma scale 9 - 14) that resolved without intervention over several hours. Only symptomatic and supportive care was required. The median hospital stay was 1 day (IQR: 1 - 2) and the case fatality was zero (95 % confidence interval: 0 - 4. 2 %). This low case fatality compared favorably with the case fatality of other common herbicides in our cohort: paraquat > 40 %, propanil > 10 %, 4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxyacetic acid > 5 %, and glyphosate > 2 %. Conclusion. This combination herbicide product appears to be safe in patients with acute self-poisoning, particularly in comparison with other herbicides, and causing few clinical feature...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic rice {{systems can}} {{substitute}} the conventional rice cultivation {{system in the}} wake of water shortage and energy crises. The major constraint in the success of aerobic rice is high weed infestation. Hence, we have discussed the weed flora, yield losses, herbicide-resistant weeds, need for integrated weed management, and approaches to manage weeds in aerobic rice systems. A review of several studies indicated that 90 weed species were competing with rice under aerobic systems, causing 23 - 100 % reductions in grain yield. Weed control in aerobic rice gets difficult due to shifts in weed flora and herbicide resistance development in weeds. A wide increase in grain yield (15 - 307 %) by implementing different weed control practices elaborates the scope of weed management in aerobic rice. Practices, such as soil solarization, sowing of competitive crop cultivars, stale seedbed preparation, mulch application, correct fertilization, and intercropping, were found to have particular significance for managing weeds in aerobic rice systems. Moreover, hand weeding and mechanical control were more effective when combined with other weed control methods. Herbicides, such as pendimethalin, 2, 4 -D, penoxsulam, <b>ethoxysulfuron,</b> bispyribac-sodium, triclopyr, imazosulfuron, bensulfuron, pretilachlor, and metsulfuron, were found most effective in aerobic rice systems. Keeping in view the severity of weed infestation in these systems and the evolution of herbicide resistance, reliance on a single control method is out of question. Hence, the approach of integrated weed management is the most appropriate for proper weed management and the subsequent success of rice cultivation using aerobic systems...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{dependency}} of direct seeding of rice {{on the application}} of herbicide and possibility of weed resistance to herbicides, the use of mixtures of herbicides is of considerable importance. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} consecutive applications of some herbicides with lower concentrations, including Thiobencarb, Pretilachlor, Bensulfuronmethyl, <b>Ethoxysulfuron</b> + Anilofos, Butachlor, and Propanil, on weed density, yield and yield components of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hashemi) an experiment based on a randomized complete block design with eight treatments and three replications was conducted at the Research Farm of Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University of Guilan in 2014. The results showed that plant height, seed yield, dry matter yield, harvest index, number of tillers and number fertile florets per panicle were affected by these treatments. Tandem use of Thiobencarb (9 day before sowing), Bensulfuronmethyl (9 day after sowing) and Propanil (30 day after sowing) affected weed dry matter and weed density by 92 and 98 %, respectively. The highest number of fertile floret per panicle (71 pcs) and tillers number per plant (14 pcs) were observed in plots where Thiobencarb, Bensulfuronmethyl and Propanil were used consecutively. In this treatment, seed yield and biological yield increased by 72 and 73 percent respectively as compared with that of control. Application of Pretilachlor caused phytotoxicity, where by reduced plant height and seed yield. The highest grain yield of rice (3092 kg. ha- 1) was produced by consecutive use of Thiobencarb, Bensulfuronmethyl and Propanil.

After consecutive years of use, the Cyperaceae species, globe fringerush (Fimbristylis miliacea) {{began to show}} resistance to ALS (acetolactate synthase) inhibitors. Globe fringerush {{is one of the}} most problematic herbicide-resistant weeds in irrigated rice in the state of Santa Catarina in the South of Brazil. The objective of this research was to examine cross resistance of globe fringerush to ALS inhibitors, under field conditions. Two experiments were conducted in a rice field naturally infested with ALS-resistant globe fringerush in Santa Catarina, in the 2008 / 09 and 2009 / 10 cropping seasons. The experimental units were arranged in randomized complete block design, with five replicates, consisting of two factors (herbicide and dose) in a 4 x 5 factorial arrangement. ALS herbicides included bispyribac-sodium, <b>ethoxysulfuron,</b> pyrazosulfuron-ethyl and penoxsulam. Six-leaf globe fringerush was sprayed with herbicide doses of 0, 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 X the recommended doses in a spray volume of 200 L ha- 1. The number of rice culm, filled and sterile grains, plant height, dry shoot biomass and grain yield were recorded. Globe fringerush control was evaluated 28 and 70 days after herbicide application (DAA); shoots were harvested at 13 weeks after herbicide application and dry weight recorded. Competition with globe fringerush reduced the number of culm and rice grain yield. The globe fringerush biotype in this field was resistant to all ALS herbicides tested. Penoxsulam had the highest level of activity among treatments at 28 and 70 DAA, but the control level was only 50 % and 42 %, respectively, in the second year of assessment. This was not enough to prevent rice yield loss. Alternative herbicides and weed control strategies are necessary to avoid yield losses in rice fields infested with ALS-resistant biotypes of globe fringerush...|$|E
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the staple}} food crops of India, and Karnataka {{is one of the}} major rice-producing states. The primary method of rice {{establishment}} in Karnataka is transplanting, but farmers are opting to shift to direct-seeding of rice. Weed management is critical for realizing optimal yield of direct-seeded rice (DSR). The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature on weeds and weed management in rice in Karnataka, identify improved weed-management technologies for delivery to farmers, and suggest research needs. Some 98 weed species are reported to be associated with rice in Karnataka. Weed control to date in Karnataka has mostly been based on herbicides. Hand-weeding was found to be effective in all methods of rice establishment. However, it is time-consuming, tedious, and costly because labor is becoming scarce and unavailable, and labor wages are higher. Several PRE and POST herbicides that were effective in other Asian countries were also found to be effective in managing weeds in rice established by different methods in Karnataka. Bensulfuron plus pretilachlor and pyrazosulfuron in aerobic rice and pendimethalin, thiobencarb, bispyribac-sodium, cyhalofop, fenoxaprop plus chlorimuron plus metsulfuron, and fenoxaprop plus <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> in dry-DSR were found effective in managing weeds. In wet-DSR, butachlor plus safener and pretilachlor plus safener were effective. Thiobencarb, pendimethalin, pretilachlor, azimsulfuron plus metsulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, butachlor, cinosulfuron, oxadiazon, and quinclorac were found promising for weed management in transplanted rice. Integration of herbicides with hand-weeding or intercultivation was found to be effective in rice established by different methods. Options that were found economical in managing weeds varied across the different rice-establishment methods. The need for developing location-specific, sustainable, integrated weed management and extension of available technologies for the farming community in Karnataka is emphasized...|$|E

For that, two experiments were performed at green house of FAEM/UFPel arranged in a completely randomized design, with four replicates. The experiment I were consisted of resistant (CYPDI 9) and susceptible of C. difformis biotype and rate of the pyrazosulfuron-ethyl herbicide, corresponding to 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32 and 64 times de registered rate (20 g ha- 1). The evaluated variables were visual control and aerial dry mass (MPAS) to the 28 days after the application of the treatments (DAT). In the experiment II the treatments were consisted of the same biotype (CYPDI 9 and CYPDI 8), nine herbicides azimsulfuron (6 g ha- 1); bentazon (900 g ha- 1); bispyribac-sodium (48 g ha- 1); carfentrazone-ethyl (40 g ha- 1); <b>ethoxysulfuron</b> (72 g ha- 1); glyphosate (900 g ha- 1); penoxsulam (36 g ha- 1); propanil (3600 g ha- 1) and pyrazosulfuron-ethyl (20 g ha- 1) and checks that didn't applied herbicide.
