A total of 730 subjects was randomized in a treatment ratio of 2 : 1 (ganirelix:buserelin) using an interactive voice response system which stratified for age, type of infertility and planned fertilization procedure [IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) ]. The median duration of GnRH analogue treatment was 5 days in the <b>ganirelix</b> group and 26 days in the buserelin group, whereas the median total rFSH dose was 1500 IU and 1800 IU respectively. In addition, in the <b>ganirelix</b> group the mean duration of stimulation was 1 day shorter. During <b>ganirelix</b> treatment the incidence of LH rises (LH ≥ 10 IU/l) was 2. 8 % versus 1. 3 % during rFSH stimulation in the buserelin group. On the day of triggering ovulation by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), the mean number of follicles ≥ 11 mm diameter was 10. 7 and 11. 8, and the median serum oestradiol concentrations were 1190 pg/ml and 1700 pg/ml in the <b>ganirelix</b> and buserelin groups respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effects of <b>ganirelix,</b> a GnRH receptor antagonist, on bladder function and detrusor overactivity (DO) in female rats. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats received 2 wk of daily systemic (0. 1 mg/kg) or acute intravesical administration (IVES; 0. 14 mg/l or 1. 4 mg/l) <b>ganirelix</b> or vehicle (controls). MEASUREMENTS: Assessments were obtained using cystometry in awake rats, organ bath studies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and western blot (WB). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Luteinising hormone levels were lower in rats treated systemically with <b>ganirelix</b> than in controls. No differences were observed in body or bladder weights. Micturition interval (MI), micturition volume (MV), residual volume, and bladder capacity (BC) were similar in both groups at baseline. No differences in urodynamic pressure parameters were observed between groups at baseline. Intravesical prostaglandin E(2) reduced MI, MV, and BC, and it increased basal pressure (BP), threshold pressure (TP), flow pressure (FP), and maximum pressure (MP) in all rats. MI, MV, and BC were reduced by 43 %± 4 %, 50 %± 4 %, and 43 %± 4 % (controls) versus 22 %± 3 %, 23 %± 3 %, and 21 %± 3 % (ganirelix-treated rats; p< 0. 001). TP and FP increased by 38 %± 8 % and 30 %± 4 % (controls) versus 16 %± 7 % and 16 %± 5 % (ganirelix; p< 0. 05). The maximal force of contractions for carbachol was larger in detrusor from ganirelix-treated rats (231 % vs 177 % of 60 mM K+-induced contractions). At 0. 14 mg/l, but not 0. 14 mg/l, IVES <b>ganirelix</b> increased MI, MV, and BC and decreased BP, TP, FP, and MP. In vitro, <b>ganirelix</b> had no effect on detrusor function.

40|$|Objective: GnRH antagonists have {{recently}} been introduced {{for the prevention of}} premature LH surges during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). We have here investigated whether the GnRH antagonists cetrorelix and <b>ganirelix</b> exert effects on ovarian steroidogenesis. Since there is some controversy about the action of GnRH agonists in the human ovary we also tested the effect of triptorelin on steroid production in cultured human granulosa lutein cells. Methods: Cells were obtained from patients treated with different protocols of COH. In addition to gonadotropins they received triptorelin, cetrorelix, <b>ganirelix</b> or no GnRH analogue. Results: Such in vivo treatment did not result in significant effects of triptorelin or the two GnRH antagonists on spontaneous or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) -stimulated steroidogenesis. To exclude the possibility that the in vivo treatment might not affect in vitro steroid production because of low or absent peptide activity, we performed in vitro treatments with triptorelin, cetrorelix and <b>ganirelix</b> for up to 96 h. However, these treatment paradigms did not influence basal or hCG-stimulated steroid production. Conclusions: We conclude that GnRH antagonists do not exert any significant effects on ovarian steroidogenesis in vitro and therefore their introduction into protocols of COH is unlikely to impair ovarian function.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was designed to}} assess the impact of oral contraceptive (OC) scheduling with a GnRH antagonist (<b>ganirelix)</b> regimen on the ovarian response of women undergoing recombinant FSH (rFSH) stimulation for IVF, compared with a non-scheduled <b>ganirelix</b> regimen and a long GnRH agonist (nafarelin) protocol. METHODS: A total of 110 women was treated with an OC and <b>ganirelix,</b> 111 with <b>ganirelix</b> alone and 111 with nafarelin. The OC (containing 30 µg ethinylestradiol/ 150 µg desogestrel) was taken for 14 – 28 days and stopped 2 days prior to the start of rFSH treatment. Primary efficiency parameters were the number of cumulus-oocyte complexes (per attempt) and the number of grade 1 or 2 embryos (per attempt). RESULTS: In terms of follicular growth and hormone profiles, the OC-scheduled antagonist regimen mimicked the agonist regimen rather than the (non-scheduled) GnRH antagonist regimen. In the OC-scheduled GnRH antagonist group and the nafarelin group (versus the non-scheduled antagonist group), pituitary suppression was more profound at the start of stimulation (P # 0. 001), there was a slower start of follicular growth (P # 0. 001), longer stimulation was required (11. 7 and 10. 3 days respectively versus 9. 4; P # 0. 001), and more rFSH was used (2667 and 2222 IU versus 1966 IU; P # 0. 001). In the three groups, the number of oocytes was similar (13. 1, 12. 9 and 11. 5 respectively; not significant) as well as the number of good quality embryos (5. 1, 5. 7 and 5. 0 respectively; not significant).

40|$|Innovative drug {{development}} {{is essential to}} improve therapy over time by offering better efficacy, safety and/or treatment convenience. This thesis summarizes the sequential clinical development of three innovative fertility drugs namely follitropin-b (recombinant FSH), <b>ganirelix</b> (GnRH antagonist) and corifollitropin alfa (recombinant long-acting FSH agonist). Follitropin-b replaced urinary FSH, <b>ganirelix</b> introduced a new and short treatment protocol, and corifollitropin alfa replaced the first 7 daily (r) FSH injections during ovarian stimulation in a GnRH antagonist protocol. The development of these drugs has dramatically changed hormonal treatment of women participating in an ART program from being lengthy and complicated to short and simple. Comparative preclinical pharmacology is essential to determine the mechanism of action, specificity, and bioactivity to predict the potency in humans. The first-in-human phase I studies of follitropin-b and corifollitropin alfa included subjects with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) as the immunogenicity is hard to predict in preclinical models. Apart from safety and pharmacokinetics, it was examined whether follitropin-b could stimulate multiple follicular growth in the complete absence of LH activity. The first-in-human study of the fusion molecule corifollitropin alfa in HH men was focusing on its potential immunogenicity. Only thereafter, a phase I study in pituitary-suppressed female volunteers was performed with increasing doses of corifollitropin alfa. Phase II research of follitropin-b {{was limited to the}} question whether patients down-regulated with different GnRH agonist protocols could be treated with pure recombinant FSH lacking LH activity. In contrast, the GnRH antagonist <b>ganirelix</b> was tested in a double-blind, dose-finding study including 6 dose groups of which the lowest and highest dose group were discontinued and finally one dose was selected for further development. Corifollitropin alfa was initially tested in a feasibility study and thereafter in a phase II controlled dose-finding study that demonstrated that the optimal dose was between the lowest and highest test dose. Subsequent dose selection was based on modeling and simulation taking into account the inverse relationship between exposure to corifollitropin alfa and body weight and that FSH activity has to retain for 7 days above the threshold to support multiple follicular development. In comparative phase III studies of follitropin-b, <b>ganirelix</b> and corifollitropin alfa, the number of oocytes or the pregnancy rate was the primary endpoint. In time, follitropin-b was compared to urinary FSH and developed in a long GnRH agonist protocol. Subsequently, the GnRH antagonist <b>ganirelix</b> was compared to a long GnRH agonist protocol and finally a single dose of corifollitropin alfa was compared to daily follitropin-b using a <b>ganirelix</b> protocol. Main safety endpoints during phase III trials focused on the incidence of adverse events including Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), hypersensitivity, immunogenicity, and the health outcome of offspring. Registration of new drugs requires a positive benefit/risk ratio based on the evaluation of all efficacy and safety parameters. Following drug approval, retrospective analyses may support further development of treatment regimens or for specific subgroups of patients.

Endometrium cancer cell lines obtained from three patients were used for this study. After trypsinization in 0. 5 % in calcium magnesium, free phosphate buffer solution (CMFPBS) cells were seeded on glass slides in 24 -well plates containing DMEM-F 12 medium and 10 % fetal calf serum as culture medium. Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 ºC in 5 % CO 2. GnRH agonist leuprolide (Lucrin 1 µmol/L), GnRH antagonist <b>ganirelix</b> (Orgalutran 1 µmol/L), leuprolide with octreotide (Sandostatin 10 - 6 mol/L), <b>ganirelix</b> with octreotide and no drug were added to the wells. Apoptosis and cells proliferations were evaluated after 12, 24, 48 and 72 th hours of incubation. The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by TdT mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method; cell proliferation was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Results: Apoptotic index in grade I EEC cell line among ganirelix-octreotide treated cells and leuprolide-octreotide combination therapy were respectively higher than the untreated control (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 001). The number of apoptotic cells in grade II EEC cell line among leuprolide-octreotide and leuprolide were significantly (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001) higher than in controls. In grade III EEC cell line, the number of TUNEL positive cells among leuprolide, <b>ganirelix</b> and ganirelix-octreotide therapiy groups were significantly higher than in untreated control. Time dependent antiproliferative effect was obtained with leuprolide and leuprolide-octreotide in grade I EEC (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001). Grade II EEC cell line is not influenced by hormonotherapies.

At single subcutaneous injections of 0. 3 to 10 microg/kg in rats, degarelix produced a dose-dependent suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis as revealed by the decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. Duration of LH suppression increased with the dose: in the rat, significant suppression of LH lasted 1, 2, and 7 days after a single subcutaneous injection of degarelix at 12. 5, 50, or 200 microg/kg, respectively. Degarelix fully suppressed plasma LH and testosterone levels in the castrated and intact rats {{as well as in the}} ovariectomized rhesus monkey for more than 40 days after a single 2 -mg/kg subcutaneous injection. In comparative experiments, degarelix showed a longer duration of action than the recently developed GnRH antagonists abarelix, <b>ganirelix,</b> cetrorelix, and azaline B.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects of a thiazolidinedione (TZD) agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -gamma, rosiglitazone, in a baboon model of established endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Experimental surgery laboratory at the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi, Kenya. ANIMAL(S) : Endometriosis was induced using intrapelvic injection of eutopic menstrual endometrium in 12 female baboons with a normal pelvis that had undergone at least one menstrual cycle since the time of captivity. INTERVENTION(S) : Induction of endometriosis by laparoscopy was performed in 12 baboons with a normal pelvis. Endometrial tissue was extracted from each baboon by curettage, and a standard amount of endometrium was then seeded onto several peritoneal sites. About 34 - 68 days after the induction of laparoscopy, a pretreatment laparoscopy (baseline disease assessment) was performed in the baboons to record the extent of endometriotic lesions. The 12 baboons were randomized into three groups and treated from the day after the staging laparoscopy for a total duration of 30 days. They received phosphate-buffered saline tablets (n = 4, placebo control; placebo tablets once a day by mouth for 30 days), GnRH-antagonists (n = 4, active control; <b>ganirelix</b> acetate 125 microg/day for 30 days), or rosiglitazone (n = 4, test drug, 2 mg by mouth each day for 30 days). A third and final laparoscopy on day 30 after the start of treatment was performed to record the extent of endometriosis. The type of lesion (typical, red, white, or suspicious) was recorded. Biopsies were obtained to confirm the histological presence of endometriosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : A videolaparoscopy was performed 30 days after treatment to document the number and surface area of endometriotic lesions as well as to calculate the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score and stage. RESULT(S) : The surface area of endometriotic lesions was statistically significantly lower in rosiglitazone-treated baboons when compared with the placebo group. Baboons treated with rosiglitazone or <b>ganirelix</b> had a greater negative relative change in surface area of peritoneal endometriotic lesions than controls. The overall weighted appearance of the lesion types suggests that rosiglitazone may deter the development of newer endometriotic lesions. CONCLUSION(S) : A PPAR-gamma ligand, rosiglitazone, effectively diminishes the burden of endometriosis disease in a baboon endometriosis model.

40|$|Background GnRH antagonists {{have been}} {{introduced}} to induce persistent LH suppression. Many studies show a gradual increase of LH levels after several days of GnRH antagonist administration, the so-called escape or rebound effect. We hypothesize that, under chronic GnRH antagonist administration, a higher pituitary response to GnRH could be an underlying mechanism explaining the escape phenomenon. Methods In a prospective study, pituitary response to a supramaximal test dose of GnRH was tested in 12 post-menopausal women before and 8 days after daily treatment with 0. 5 mg GnRH antagonist (<b>ganirelix).</b> The same strategy was applied, after a wash-out period, in 11 of the same women using daily 0. 5 mg GnRH antagonist in combination with daily estradiol (E 2, 50 g) administration. The main outcome measure was the LH response 30 min after GnRH administration (ΔLH 30) after the various GnRH tests. Result SThe ΔLH 30 increased significantly after antagonist administration [Median (range) : from 65. 5 (32 - 85) to 77. 5 (47 - 122) IU/l; P = 0. 002]. During E 2 administration, the LH response to the GnRH test did not change significantly. Conclusions Pituitary response increases after 8 days of GnRH antagonist administration.

40|$|In a {{randomized}} multicenter study, the efficacies {{of two different}} GnRH agonists were {{compared with that of}} hCG for triggering final stages of oocyte maturation after ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization. Ovarian stimulation was conducted by recombinant FSH (Puregon), and the GnRH antagonist <b>ganirelix</b> (Orgalutran) was coadministered for the prevention of a premature LH rise. Luteal support was provided by daily progestin administration. Frequent blood sampling was performed at midcycle in the first 47 eligible subjects included in the current study, who were randomized for a single dose of 0. 2 mg triptorelin (n = 17), 0. 5 mg leuprorelin (n = 15), or 10, 000 IU hCG (n = 15). Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, E 2, and progesterone (P) were assessed at variable intervals. LH peaked at 4 h after both triptorelin and leuprorelin administration, with median LH levels of 130 and 107 IU/liter (P < 0. 001), respectively. LH levels returned to baseline after 24 h. Subjects receiving hCG showed peak levels of 240 IU/liter hCG 24 h after administration. A rise in FSH to 19 IU/liter (P < 0. 001) was noted in both GnRH agonist groups 8 h after injection. Within 24 h the areas under the curve for LH and FSH were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in both GnRH agonist groups compared with that for hCG. E 2 and P levels were similar for all groups up to the day of oocyte retrieval. Luteal phase areas under the curve for P and E 2 were significantly elevated (P < 0. 001) in the hCG group. The mean (+/-SD) numbers of oocytes retrieved were 9. 8 +/- 5. 4, 8. 7 +/- 4. 5, and 8. 3 +/- 3. 3; the percentages of metaphase II oocytes were 72 %, 85 %, and 86 %; and fertilization rates were 61 %, 62 %, and 56 % in the triptorelin, leuprorelin, and hCG group, respectively (P = NS for all three comparisons). These findings support the effective induction of final oocyte maturation in both GnRH agonist groups. In summary, after treatment with the GnRH antagonist <b>ganirelix</b> for the prevention of premature LH surges, triggering of final stages of oocyte maturation can be induced effectively by a single bolus injection of GnRH agonist, as demonstrated by the induced endogenous LH and FSH surge and the quality and fertilization rate of recovered oocytes. Moreover, corpus luteum formation is induced by GnRH agonists with luteal phase steroid levels closer to the physiological range compared with hCG. This more physiological approach for inducing oocyte maturation may represent a successful and safer alternative for in vitro fertilization patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{significance}} of suppressed LH levels in GnRH antagonist cycles for IVF outcome is currently unknown. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate prospectively the association between LH levels and ongoing pregnancy achievement after GnRH antagonist initiation in IVF cycles. Methods: Ovarian stimulation with a fixed dose of 200 IU recombinant FSH and daily GnRH antagonist (<b>ganirelix)</b> 0. 25 mg from day 6 of stimulation was initiated in 116 women. Patients were not pretreated with an oral contraceptive. Induction of final oocyte maturation was performed with HCG 10 000 IU as soon as three follicles of ≥ 17 mm were present in ultrasound, and was followed by oocyte pick-up, conventional IVF or ICSI, and embryo transfer. The luteal phase was supplemented with vaginal progesterone. Results: A significant decrease of both ongoing pregnancy rate and implantation rate was present across groups of patients with increasing LH levels. The highest implantation rate and ongoing pregnancy rate was present in those patients with LH levels on day 8 of stimulation ≤ 0. 5 IU/l. Conclusions: Profound suppression of LH on day 8 of stimulation is associated with a significantly higher chance of achieving an ongoing pregnancy. More studies are necessary to evaluate this phenomenon further. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of premature luteinization hormone (LH) surge prevention in an intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycle by GnRH antagonist administration. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients with unexplained or mild male infertility or minimal to mild endometriosis were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. There were twenty patients in group A (with GnRH antagonist) and 40 patients in group B (without GnRH antagonist). In all of the participants, clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (CC+HMG) were used for ovarian stimulation. When at least one follicle with ≥ 16 mm diameter was seen, LH surge was checked by a urinary LH kit. In patients with negative results, human chorionic gonadotropin was continued in both groups, but in group A 0. 25 mg <b>Ganirelix</b> SQ was administered for two days,,then in both groups human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was injected {{on the third day}} and IUI was done 36 - 40 hours later. Ongoing pregnancy was the primary outcome. Results: Baseline characters and clinical parameters were similar in both groups with the exception of ≥ 14 mm follicles which were higher in group A (p value = 0. 003). The pregnancy rate in both groups was not significantly different, although it was higher in group B (10 % in group A and 15 % in group B). Conclusion: At least in CC+HMG stimulated cycles for IUI, the occurrence of premature LH surge could have a useful rule and GnRH antagonist administration could be an inappropriate intervention...|$|E

Eleven egg donors participated in the study. Two random-start gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocols were assessed in which <b>ganirelix</b> was initiated on either day 10 (protocol B) or on day 20 (protocol C) of the menstrual cycle and was continued until estradiol levels were below 60 pg/dL. These protocols were compared with a standard protocol (protocol A). The main outcome of interest was the number of metaphase 2 oocytes retrieved. Results from this study show that the number of mature oocytes retrieved was comparable across the different protocols (14. 3 ± 4. 6 in the standard protocol versus 13. 0 ± 9. 1 and 13. 2 ± 5. 2 in protocols B and C, respectively; values expressed as mean ± standard deviation).

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} dose-response relationship of corifollitropin alfa to initiate multifollicular {{development for the}} first 7 days of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). METHODS: Women aged 20 - 39 years undergoing COS for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection were randomized to a single dose of corifollitropin alfa 60, 120 or 180 μg, or daily injections of 150 IU recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH). Patients treated with corifollitropin alfa started fixed daily treatment with 150 IU rFSH on stimulation Day 8. Patients received a GnRH antagonist (<b>ganirelix</b> 0. 25 mg/day) from stimulation Day 5 until the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics of corifollitropin alfa were dose-proportional. The main reason for not having embryo transfer was insufficient ovarian response in 30. 8, 2. 6, 3. 8 and 7. 4 % of patients in the corifollitropin alfa 60, 120, 180 μg and rFSH groups, respectively. On Day 8, the mean (standard deviation) number of follicles ≥ 11 mm was 6. 8 (4. 4), 10. 1 (6. 1) and 12. 8 (7. 5), respectively. The number of cumulus-oocyte complexes retrieved showed a clear dose-response relationship (P < 0. 0001), being 5. 2 (5. 5), 10. 3 (6. 3) and 12. 5 (8. 0) in the three dose groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single injection of corifollitropin alfa induces dose-related increase in multifollicular development and {{in the number of}} retrieved oocytes. The optimal dose for a 1 -week interval is higher than 60 μg and lower than 180 μg and will be selected based on modelling and simulation taking into account insufficient stimulation as well as overstimulation.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues [leuprolide acetate (LA) and <b>ganirelix</b> acetate (GA) ] modulate {{gene expression}} in Ishikawa cells used as surrogate for human endometrial epithelial cells in vitro. The specific aims were: (i) {{to study the}} modulatory effect of GnRH analogues by RT-PCR [in the absence and presence of E 2 and P 4, and cyclic adenosine monophos-phate (cAMP) ] on mRNA expression of genes modulated during the window of implantation in GnRH analogues/rFSH-treated assisted reproductive technology cycles including OPTINEURIN (OPTN), CHROMATIN MODIFYING PROTEIN (CHMP 1 A), PROSAPOSIN (PSAP), IGFBP- 5 and SORTING NEXIN 7 (SNX 7), and (ii) to analyze the 5 '-flanking regions of such genes {{for the presence of}} putative steroid-response elements [estrogen-response elements (EREs) and P 4 -response element (PREs) ]. Ishikawa cells were cytokeratin+/vimentin 2 and expressed ERa,ERb, PR and GnRH-R proteins. At 6 and 24 h, neither LA nor GA alone had an effect on gene expression. GnRH analogues alone or following E 2 and/or P 4 co-incubation for 24 h also had no effect on gene expression, but P 4 significantly increased expression of CHMP 1 A. E 2 + P 4 treatment for 4 days, alone or followed by GA, had no effect, but E 2 + P 4 treatment followed by LA significantly decreased IGFBP- 5 expression. The addition of 8 -Br cAMP did not modify gene expression, with the exception of IGFBP- 5 that was significantly increased. The GnRH analogues did not modify intracellular cAMP levels. We identified conserved EREs for OPN, CHMP 1 A, SNX 7 and PSAP and PREs for SNX 7. We conclude that GnRH analogues appear not to have major direct effects on gene expression of human endo-metrial epithelial cells in vitro. © The Author 2010.

40|$|A {{series of}} antagonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{of the general}} formula Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph/ 4 Amf(P) -D 4 Aph/D 4 Amf(Q) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 was synthesized, characterized, and {{screened}} for duration of inhibition of luteinizing hormone release in a castrated male rat assay. Selected analogues were tested in a reporter gene assay (IC 50 and pA 2) and an in vitro histamine release assay. P and Q contain urea/carbamoyl functionalities designed to increase potential intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding opportunities for structural stabilization and peptide/receptor interactions, respectively. These substitutions resulted in analogues with increased hydrophilicity and a lesser propensity to form gels in aqueous solution than azaline B [Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(Atz) -D 4 Aph(Atz) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 with Atz = 3 '-amino- 1 H- 1 ', 2 ', 4 '-triazol- 5 '-yl, 5], {{and in some cases}} they resulted in a significant increase in duration of action after subcutaneous (s. c.) administration. Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(L-hydroorotyl) -D 4 Aph(carbamoyl) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 (acetate salt is FE 200486) (31) and eight other congeners (20, 35, 37, 39, 41, 45 - 47) were identified that exhibited significantly longer duration of action than acyline [Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(Ac) -D 4 Aph(Ac) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2] (6) when administered subcutaneously in castrated male rats at a dose of 50 microg in 100 microL of phosphate buffer. No correlation was found between retention times on a C 18 reverse phase column using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 (a measure of hydrophilicity) or affinity in an in vitro human GnRH report gene assay (pA 2) and duration of action. FE 200486 was selected for preclinical studies, and some of its properties were compared to those of other clinical candidates. In the intact rat, <b>ganirelix,</b> abarelix, azaline B, and FE 200486 inhibited plasma testosterone for 1, 1, 14, and 57 days, respectively, at 2 mg/kg s. c. in 5 % mannitol (injection volume = 20 microL). Based on the information that 31, 33, 35 and 37 were significantly shorter acting than acyline or azaline B after intravenous administration (100 microg/rat), we surmised that the very long duration of action of the related FE 200486 (for example) was likely due to unique physicochemical properties such as solubility in aqueous milieu, comparatively low propensity to form gels, and ability to diffuse at high concentrations {{in a manner similar to}} that described for slow release formulations of peptides. Indeed, in rats injected s. c. with FE 200486 (2 mg/kg), plasmatic concentrations of FE 200486 remained above 5 ng/mL until day 41, and the time after which they dropped below 3 ng/mL and plasma LH levels started rising until full recovery was reached at day 84 with levels of FE 200486 hovering around 1 ng/mL.
