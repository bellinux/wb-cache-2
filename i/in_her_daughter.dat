5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land sales pitch, {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his interest <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b> She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E
500|$|As Charlotte grew older, her {{behaviour}} came {{to include}} flirtation, spreading malicious gossip, and causing trouble, traits {{her mother had}} noticed in her daughter's youth and had hoped she would outgrow. Vicky characterised her as a [...] "wheedling little kitten [...] can be so loving whenever she wants something". She believed that Charlotte's [...] "pretty exterior" [...] hid [...] "dangerous character traits", and blamed nature for producing such qualities <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1917, Ernest Hartley was {{transferred}} to Bangalore as {{an officer in the}} Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting [...] "Little Bo Peep". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, southwest London, from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become [...] "a great actress". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard, Biarritz, San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended A Connecticut Yankee, one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.|$|E
60|$|Poor Lady Staveley {{had been}} possessed of no such wit at all. The sphynx {{which she had}} read had been one much more <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own line.

2500|$|After Yolanda Adams, Karen Clark Sheard {{became the}} 2nd gospel artist to sign to Elektra Records.

2500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Normal School of Science, Wells was {{left without a}} source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him {{to stay with her}} for a while, which solved his {{immediate}} problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter,</b> Isabel. He would later go on to court her. To earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as The Pall Mall Gazette, later collecting these in volume form as Select Conversations with an Uncle (1895) and Certain Personal Matters (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C Smith, [...] "Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It obvious that many early Wells items have been lost." [...] His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, The Time Machine, in 1895.|$|E

6000|$|... "Moreover, her {{interests}} {{are not the}} only factors in the problem. Mrs. Lambert's life is bound up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter,</b> and without her she would suffer. The well-being of the family as a whole is against her going." ...|$|E
60|$|The mother, {{mindful of}} Serviss's {{connection}} with a great university, made no objection to the plan.

50|$|In 2015, Shene Catholique-Valpy, a Chipewyan {{woman in}} the Northwest Territories, {{challenged}} the territorial government over its refusal to permit her to use the ʔ character <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter's</b> name, Sahaiʔa. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the character. Sahaiʔa's mother finally registered her name with a hyphen {{in place of the}} ʔ, while continuing to challenge the policy. Shortly afterward, another woman named Andrea Heron also challenged the territory on the same grounds, for refusing to accept the ʔ character <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter's</b> Slavey name, Sakaeʔah (actually a cognate of Sahaiʔa).|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{really think}} that I should answer him."

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} as bad at that," [...] {{returned}} Britt. [...] "You see, the mother {{has been for}} years in close daily communion--as she supposes--with her husband, her little son, and others of her dead. Half of her daily life is in these joys, the other half <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b> There stood the wall that stopped me. I couldn't express my doubt to the mother.

60|$|Lady Chatterton {{never having}} {{implanted}} {{any of her}} favorite systems <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter,</b> so much by precept as {{by the force of}} example in her own person, as well as by indirect eulogiums on certain people who were endowed with those qualities and blessings she most admired, on the present occasion Catherine did not unburden herself in terms to her mother; but by a regular gradation of complaints, aimed more at the world than at her husband, she soon let the knowing dowager see their application, and in the end completely removed the veil from her domestic grievances.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, a Slavey {{woman named}} Andrea Heron {{challenged}} the territorial government over {{its refusal to}} permit the ʔ character, representing the Slavey glottal stop, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter's</b> name, Sakaeʔah, despite Slavey languages being official in the NWT. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the character. Heron had registered the name with a hyphen instead of the ʔ when <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> was born, but when Sakaeʔah was 6, Ms. Heron joined a challenge by a Chipewyan woman named Shene Catholique-Valpy regarding the same character <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own <b>daughter's</b> name, Sahaiʔa.|$|R

6000|$|... "All right," [...] broke <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter</b> quickly, with a {{shade of}} anxiety {{in her voice}} as though she {{did not wish to}} learn what her mother thought. [...] "I don't mind, I am sure. I don't want to go to Zululand, and see this horrid Dingaan, who is always killing people, and I am quite sure that father would never convert him, the wicked monster. It is like the Garden of Eden, isn't it, with the sea thrown in.

60|$|But after all, a {{woman may}} find herself again <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter.</b> There, at least, is consolation. For, as Mrs. Rasselyer-Brown herself admitted, her daughter, Dulphemia, was herself again. There were, of course, {{differences}}, certain differences of face and appearance. Mr. Snoop had expressed this fact exquisitely {{when he said}} that it was the difference between a Burne-Jones and a Dante Gabriel Rossetti. But even at that the mother and daughter were so alike that people, certain people, were constantly mistaking them on the street. And as everybody that mistook them was apt to be asked to dine on five-dollar champagne there was plenty of temptation towards error.|$|E
60|$|To {{her mother}} {{most of all}} Gwendolen was bent on acting {{complete}} satisfaction, and poor Mrs. Davilow was so far deceived that she took the unexpected distance at which she was kept, {{in spite of what}} she felt to be Grandcourt's handsome behavior in providing for her, as a comparative indifference <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>daughter,</b> now that marriage had created new interests. To be fetched to lunch and then to dinner along with the Gascoignes, to be driven back soon after breakfast the next morning, and to have brief calls from Gwendolen in which her husband waited for her outside either on horseback or sitting in the carriage, was all the intercourse allowed to her mother.|$|E
