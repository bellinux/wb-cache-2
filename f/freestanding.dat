5|$|Built between 1088 and {{the early}} 15th century, the unusual {{features}} of Chichester Cathedral are a Transitional retro choir, a pair of early Norman relief carvings and its <b>freestanding</b> belfry of the 15th century. The spire, rebuilt after its collapse in 1860, {{can be seen from}} the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument: A <b>freestanding</b> Doric {{column in}} Fort Greene memorializing {{all those who}} died while kept {{prisoner}} on the British ships just off the shore of Brooklyn, in Wallabout Bay.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Terminal 4, all stations in the airport are <b>freestanding</b> structures, connected to their respective terminal buildings by an aerial walkway. Terminal 4 opened in 2013 with the station inside the terminal building itself.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Roman {{sculpture}} survive abundantly, {{though often}} in damaged or fragmentary condition, including <b>freestanding</b> statues and statuettes in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings, temples, and monuments {{such as the}} Ara Pacis, Trajan's Column, and the Arch of Titus. Niches in amphitheatres such as the Colosseum were originally filled with statues, and no formal garden was complete without statuary.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, a <b>freestanding</b> {{skeleton}} tower {{replaced the}} light and the vacant lighthouse was soon vandalized. In 1973, the town of Greenwich acquired the lighthouse and had full-time caretakers living in the light until 2003. A caretaker continued to live in the old lighthouse until 2003, when it became too dilapidated. In 1991, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a <b>freestanding</b> organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E
5|$|The Camus Cross, {{otherwise}} known as the Camuston or Camustane Cross, is an Early Medieval Scottish standing stone located on the Panmure Estate near Carnoustie in Angus, Scotland. First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between Camuston and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule, it is a <b>freestanding</b> cross, rare in Eastern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The Guilden Morden boar {{recalls the}} Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, where helmets with boar imagery are {{referenced}} five times. In three cases {{they appear to}} feature <b>freestanding</b> boars atop the helmets, like the Guilden Morden example. Such is the case when Grendel's mother seeks vengeance {{for the death of}} her son.|$|E
5|$|The four-storey {{building}} is externally austere. A <b>freestanding</b> cube, the main façade faces Republic Square and is inlaid with Karst marble, with green Oplotnica granite below each window. The only decorative element is the two storey main portal – four oak doors surrounded by statues by Zdenko Kalin and Karel Putrih which represent working people.|$|E
5|$|The local bedrock {{is a hard}} red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} used {{in the construction of}} monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest <b>freestanding</b> stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} <b>freestanding</b> house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or <b>freestanding</b> hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a <b>freestanding</b> five-sided four-gun battery, {{constructed}} around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{this period of}} {{unanimous}} passion for Bashō's poems came to an end. Masaoka Shiki, arguably Bashō's most famous critic, tore down the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bashō's style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bashō's poetry accessible in English, and to leading intellectuals and the Japanese public at large. He invented the term haiku (replacing hokku) {{to refer to the}} <b>freestanding</b> 5-7-5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the haikai no renga.|$|E
5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of <b>freestanding</b> stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E
5|$|The Lapidary is {{an open-air}} museum of {{primarily}} stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings {{that no longer}} exist. Some are set into the walls around a 1969 terrace, while others are <b>freestanding</b> at various locations in the park. For example, in {{the walls of the}} terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Straße and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschloß.|$|E
5|$|The {{irregular}} parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik {{consists of}} four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Minčeta Tower, and to {{the east side of}} the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, <b>freestanding,</b> St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{bears no}} idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's {{classification}} system, it is a class III stone. Intact <b>freestanding</b> crosses {{of this age}} are comparatively rare, perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage, and {{the only ones in}} Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 400 public artworks in the City of Westminster, a borough in central London. Those {{discussed}} in this article include <b>freestanding</b> statues, busts and other kinds of permanent sculpture, memorials (excluding plaques without a sculptural element on buildings), fountains, murals, gates and exterior mosaics in the City of Westminster, except for those in the former metropolitan boroughs of Paddington and St Marylebone and in two of the Royal Parks of London, namely Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Separate articles list works in the aforementioned areas and architectural sculpture across the borough.|$|E
5|$|Typically, cemeteries of {{more than}} 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice {{designed}} by architect Reginald Blomfield. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in churchyards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a <b>freestanding</b> four-point limestone Latin cross, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet. A bronze longsword, blade down, is embedded {{on the face of}} the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay {{at the very back}} of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a <b>freestanding</b> building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the <b>freestanding</b> Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|On the interior, Strickland {{placed the}} grand {{staircase}} {{that connects the}} three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and <b>freestanding</b> piers. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E
5|$|The {{exemplar of}} Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build <b>freestanding</b> entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to <b>freestanding</b> columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to <b>freestanding</b> chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo is {{the most}} {{populated}} of Japan's 47prefectures. In Tokyo, there are 46buildings and structures that stand taller than 185metres (607ft). The tallest structure in the prefecture is Tokyo Skytree, a lattice tower that rises 634metres (2,080ft), which was completed in 2012. It also stands as the tallest structure in Japan, the tallest tower {{in the world and}} the 2nd-tallest <b>freestanding</b> structure in the world. The tallest building and third-tallest overall structure in Tokyo is the 256-metre-tall (838ft) Toranomon Hills, which was completed in 2014. The prefecture's second tallest building is Midtown Tower, which rises 54stories and 248metres (814ft) in height. Overall, of the 25tallest buildings and structures in Japan, 16are in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} planned {{to build the}} Reagan Library at Stanford University, and an agreement was reached with the university in 1984. Those plans were canceled in 1987, and the <b>freestanding</b> site in Simi Valley was chosen the same year. Construction of the library began in 1988, and the center was dedicated on November 4, 1991. The dedication ceremonies were {{the first time in}} United States history that five United States Presidents gathered together in the same place: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan himself, and George H. W. Bush. Six First Ladies also attended: Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, and Barbara Bush. Only Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend; but, her children Caroline Kennedy-Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr. were in attendance along with Luci Johnson Turpin, younger daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as descendants of Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the <b>freestanding</b> platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Monastic {{foundations}} {{were once}} abundant in Dorset, but all {{ceased to exist}} at the Dissolution. The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until {{the turn of the}} 18th century. Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. From the late 18th century onwards, churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. A notable exception to this trend, however, is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth—the first <b>freestanding</b> Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation. George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church. It was completed in 1789. Bournemouth, founded in 1810, has a wealth of 19th-century churches including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (formerly St Osmund's) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th-century churches in Dorset. The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior, {{it is one of the}} last examples of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler. Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940, the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984.|$|E
25|$|The pool area {{features}} the FlowRider, {{the first and}} only <b>freestanding</b> wave in Las Vegas. For $25, guests can spend 30 surfing.|$|E
25|$|Non-ceramic {{sculpture}} in Mesoamerica {{began with the}} modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from Tequixquiac that dates between 10,000 and 8,000BCE. Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, <b>freestanding</b> sculpture was done as well. <b>Freestanding</b> three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the giant Olmec stone heads. This disappeared {{for the rest of}} the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the Aztecs.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near {{shopping}} malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more <b>freestanding</b> locations.|$|E
