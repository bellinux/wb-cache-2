25|$|At 14:00, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{was told}} to prepare to be {{relieved}} by the Imperial Camel Brigade at 17:00. However, the Imperial Camel Brigade got lost until dawn, so the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was forced {{to stay in the}} firing line. By 23:00, because the brigade's horses had not <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> for 48 hours, they were sent back to Beersheba to water. They were finally relieved by the 4th Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade between 08:00 and 13:30 on 6 November, marching out on foot at 14:00 as their horses were still at Beersheba. During their service in the front line, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade suffered 87 casualties as well as 119 casualties to the horses.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{different}} vein, much later, in the 1980s, a talented generation of players revived the club's spirit. They carried {{it back to the}} top of French rugby thanks to their performances on the pitch, but they also wanted to bring the fun back into the game, to take rugby out of its Parisian anonymity. They did so through a combination of serious football, humour and self-mockery. Their famous antics were invented by the club's backs (including France flyhalf Franck Mesnel and France wing Jean-Baptiste Lafond) who once played a game in Bayonne with berets on their heads as a tribute to the tradition of attacking play of the Basque club Aviron Bayonnais (11 Jan 1987). As members of a gang which they called le show bizz, they played other matches with black make-up on (10 April 1988 at Stade Toulousain), hair dyed yellow, bald caps (26 Feb 1989 against Béziers), wigs and even dressed up as pelote players (white shirts, black jackets and berets, again) in March 1990 at Biarritz Olympique. In April 1989, they wore long red and white striped shorts to celebrate the sans-culotte who took the Bastille on 14 July 1789. They wore long white trousers to look like players of old in the French championship semi-final on 26 April 1987—and won. Their best prank was in the next game though: they played the 1987 final against Toulon with a pink bow tie (2 May). Just before kick-off, Lafond presented French president François Mitterrand, who always attended the national final, with one of those bow ties. They lost that match but went on to play the 1990 final with the same bow ties. At half-time, they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of champagne on the pitch to recover from the efforts of the first half—and won what proved to be the club's last top-flight title for a quarter-century.|$|E

500|$|The couple usually met at Wimpole Mews, when Ward was absent, {{although}} once, when Hobson was away, Profumo took Keeler to {{his home}} at Chester Terrace in Regent's Park. [...] On one occasion he borrowed a Bentley from his ministerial colleague John Hare and took Keeler for a drive around London, and another time the couple <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with Viscount Ward, the former Secretary of State for Air. During their time together, Profumo gave Keeler a few small presents, and once, a sum of £20 {{as a gift for}} her mother. Keeler maintains that although Stephen Ward asked her to obtain information from Profumo about the deployment of nuclear weapons, she did not do so. Profumo was equally adamant that no such discussions took place.|$|E
500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{prepare to}} {{interview}} Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an elderly arabber. Bayliss is convinced Tucker murdered [...] 11-year-old Adena Watson, but Pembleton is less confident. Since {{they have already}} interviewed Tucker multiple times, the court will not allow him to be bothered anymore {{if he does not}} confess after this interview, and the detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before Tucker walks free. Pembleton starts off acting friendly while Bayliss, who has taken the Watson case very personally, is more aggressive. Adena used to work for Tucker, taking care of his horse. Pembleton brings up Tucker's alcoholism, but Tucker said he gave up drinking because he used to black out, insisting he hasn't <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> in 16 months. Tucker also insists he hadn't seen Adena for three days before she died, but Bayliss shows him she had soot on her skirt that matched soot from Tucker's barn, indicating she was there the day she was killed.|$|E

500|$|During {{a moment}} of anger, Bayliss nearly presses Tucker's face against a hot pipe on the wall, but Pembleton stops him. Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her, and he agrees to submit to a {{polygraph}} test. When Bayliss leaves, Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft and comforting tone, trying to get Tucker to trust him. Pembleton suggests Tucker <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and blacked out the night he killed Adena, and he seems close to getting a confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent. With four hours left before the deadline, Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test. Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker, talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions. They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14-year-old girl, then suggest he attempted {{to have sex with}} Adena and killed her because she resisted. They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and ask him if he is sure he didn't kill her, to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies, [...] "Not right now, I'm not." ...|$|E

The gruelling schedule {{of the last two}} years and the emotional investment that was needed to play such a depressed character for such a lengthy period had taken its toll on him. Treacher said [...] "The breakdown story really got to me. One night I came home, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and just started weeping.

2500|$|He {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Temperance Willie" [...] while {{serving in the}} RCAF.

He admitted to having a few drinks during World War I, [...] "Of course I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> you cannot go through two world wars without taking a drink," [...] he told the Globe and Mail but added [...] "I think I had a few on Nov. 11, 1918, but I don't really remember having any since." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{possible}} identifications have been proposed over the years. An Adelaide newspaper, The Advertiser, on reporting {{the discovery of the}} body, gave the possible identification as [...] "E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, Payneham." [...] The following day, 3 December 1948, Johnson identified himself at a police station. That same day, another Adelaide newspaper, The News, published a photograph of the dead man on its front page, leading to additional calls from members of the public about the possible identity of the dead man. By 4 December, police had announced that the man's fingerprints were not on South Australian police records, forcing them to look further afield. On 5 December, The Advertiser reported that police were searching through military records after a man claimed to have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> with a man resembling the dead man at a hotel in Glenelg on 13 November. During their drinking session, the mystery man supposedly produced a military pension card bearing the name [...] "Solomonson".|$|E

2500|$|In {{less than}} a century, the {{one-time}} province was named [...] "Gothia", by authors including the 4th-century Orosius. The existence of Christian communities in Gothia is attested by the Passion of [...] Sabbas, [...] "a Goth by race" [...] and by the martyrologies of Wereka and Batwin, and other Gothic Christians. Large number of Goths, Taifali, and according to Zosimus [...] "other tribes that formerly dwelt among them" [...] were admitted into the Eastern Roman Empire following {{the invasion of the}} Huns in 376. In contrast with these peoples, the Carpo-Dacians [...] "were mixed with the Huns". Priscus of Panium, who visited the Hunnic Empire in 448, wrote that the empire's inhabitants spoke either Hunnic or Gothic, and that those who had [...] "commercial dealings with the western Romans" [...] also spoke Latin. He also mentions the local name of two drinks, medos and kam. Emperor Diocletian's Edict on Prices states that the Pannonians <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> named kamos. Medos may have also been an Illyrian term, but a Germanic explanation cannot be excluded.|$|E

However, in the season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Lucy feels too pressured by Raj to meet his friends, and a dinner between Lucy, Raj, and Amy does not go well. Raj apologizes for his behavior and asks Lucy to come to Leonard's goodbye party before his departure for the North Sea on Professor Stephen Hawking's expedition. However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not want to see him again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, who thinks he is completely unlovable.

2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would be if you <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E
