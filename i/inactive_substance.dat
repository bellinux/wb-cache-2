In conjunction with HTS of the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set and ChemBridge DIVERSet E (∼ 18, 000 compounds total), VS was performed with two flexible library docking/scoring methods, DockVision/Ludi and GOLD.

40|$|Human saliva and parotid fluid {{have two}} effects on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans: a {{reduction}} in the overall rate of uptake, and the promotion of a biphasic mode of uptake. The former effect had been previously shown to result from lactoperoxidase-mediated inhibition of transport or metabolism or both. The objective {{of the present study was}} to uncover the basis of the second effect. Biphasic glucose uptake consisted of a rapid phase of low capacity and short duration (approximately 10 to 15 s) followed by a slower phase of high capacity and long duration (several minutes). The slow phase is typical of cells not exposed to the secretions (control cells). S. mutans BHT cells pretreated with as little as 10 microM glucose for 10 min at 37 degrees C, followed by its removal, subsequently exhibit biphasic glucose uptake typical of saliva- or parotid fluid-treated cells. Since pretreatment of the organism with glucose, whole saliva supernatant, or parotid fluid supported subsequent transport of the nonmetabolized glucose analog, 2 -deoxyglucose, we concluded that pretreatments established a relatively stable pool of glycolytic intermediates (i. e., a phosphoenolpyruvate potential). Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of extracts from [14 C]glucose-pretreated cells confirmed the presence of a stable pool of triose phosphates. Dialysis experiments indicated that high-molecular-weight substrates in the secretions were readily utilized by the organism to establish a phosphoenolpyruvate potential, especially when the lactoperoxidase system was rendered inactive. A survey of several carbohydrate constituents of salivary glycoproteins revealed that mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine, in addition to glucose, established phosphoenolpyruvate potentials in the organisms. <b>Inactive</b> <b>substances</b> included, among others, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid. In a survey of selected amino acids, arginine alone promoted 2 -deoxyglucose accumulation by the organism, albeit feebly.

40|$|Biodegradable polymer micro and nano sized {{particles}} {{have become}} an important area {{of research in the}} field of the drug delivery because of their ability to deliver a wide range of drugs to varying areas of the body, for sustained period of time 1. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is traditionally one of the most studied polymer because its biodegradation leads to pharmacologically <b>inactive</b> <b>substances,</b> which are adsorbable by the body or removable by the metabolism 2. The size of colloidal drug carrier spheres is a crucial task since depending on it different organs are target 2; the size greatly influences also the drug efficacy and its release. Several are the experimental parameters during the whole formulation process which should be taken into account to control the size of the nanospheres. Usually the size characterization of pharmaceutical nanospheres is carried out by electron microscopy, even if also light scattering techniques are frequently used. These techniques tend to be rapid but of low resolution since they are non-fractionation methods 3 and measurements are made of the entire particle mixture. More useful are instead the separation methods, which recently include Field-Flow Fractionation, for which an higher resolution is achieved since the different particle populations are first separated and then sized. Field Flow Fractionation (FFF) is a well known and established family of elution techniques, which differ by the type of used external physical field force 4. FFF techniques are useful for the separation and the characterization of a broad range of colloidal particles, polymers and biological macromolecules and have been successfully applied for the size characterization of particle of pharmaceutical interest 5 - 12.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{foregoing}} experiments may be briefly summarized as follows: The amount of antitoxic substance obtained by precipitation with magnesium sulphate from the blood-serum of the horse corresponds, as nearly as can {{be determined by the}} use of test guinea-pigs, in full to the protective power of the serum from which it is obtained, i. e. the precipitate from 1 cc. of serum will protect against the same amount of toxin as 1 cc. of the serum itself. Equal amounts of the precipitates by magnesium sulphate from immunized and non-immunized horses act differently toward toxin; i. e. the proportion of protective substance to the precipitate from non-immunized serum is exceedingly small as compared with the proportion of antitoxin to the precipitate from sera of immunized horses. The average precipitate from the sera of immunized horses, as obtained by magnesium sulphate, is more abundant than the average precipitate from sera of non-immunized horses. In the case of the same animal before and after immunization, the serum before immunization gives a less abundant precipitate with magnesium sulphate than the serum tested after immunization. The proportion of increase per unit of antitoxic strength for the same or different horses is not constant. This may be due to an increase of <b>inactive</b> <b>substances</b> (in their relation to diphtheric toxin) or to imperfect methods of determination. The precipitates obtained by magnesium sulphate give all the reactions recognized as characteristic of globulins, and as distinguishing them from other albuminous bodies. We are not warranted, then, in the present state of our knowledge, in considering any part of these precipitates as other than globulin. But it does seem warrantable to conclude, {{from the fact that the}} globulins of normal serum do not protect, or only in comparatively large amounts, against diphtheric toxin, that new globulins are formed, or rather greatly increased in the serum of immunized horses, and that these globulins protect against the toxin. These increased globulins and the inert globulins (which from obvious causes are a very variable factor) are both precipitated by magnesium sulphate. Every animal has a physiological and pathological history more or less widely diverging from the normal, hence absolute conformity in the results obtained is not to be expected, at least with our present methods of differentiation...|$|R
40|$|To assist {{management}} and conservation needs, researchers {{have called for}} active kairomones to be elucidated and synthesized directly from animal exudates. However, the existing literature does not provide guidance on how to initiate this complex process. To our knowledge, composite synthetic predator scents that incorporate multiple compounds to accurately mimic the natural signal have not been produced. One approach to improve the accuracy of synthetics is to identify and recombine all major infochemicals within a benign solvent. Therefore, we tested 2 natural, pre-existing matrices for their potential as vehicles for delivery of a predator scent, dingo (Canis lupus dingo) urine, which causes a startle reaction among western gray kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus), and avoidance by European foxes (Vulpes vulpes). We compared 2 putative backbone matrices -aged (3 -yr old) dingo urine from a previously active lot, and 10 % methanol -to a distilled water control. We used a novel fence-crossing assay to observe kangaroo interactions with both solvents and a negative control. Our assay allowed us to control for high feeding motivation by testing compounds away from the food source. We determined that neither free-ranging kangaroos nor European red foxes were adversely affected by either treatment matrix. Foxes were, however, attracted to the aged dingo urine, and were often observed scent-rolling in the <b>inactive</b> <b>substance.</b> Our results suggest that dilute methanol could be a possible matrix for predator-scent applications for kangaroos, while aged scents may act as an attractant for nontarget species, particularly canids...|$|E
40|$|Developments {{in medical}} {{research}} have been occurring at a rapidly increasing rate {{during the past}} two decades. Expanding budgets, augmented computer capabilities, and new research tools have all dramatically enhanced research technology. Accompanying the proliferation of medical research are increasing concerns about research risks. This article focuses on placebo-controlled clinical trials. The use of placebos enables clinical investigators to compare results from subjects taking an experimental intervention to results from a group that is receiving an <b>inactive</b> <b>substance,</b> such as a sugar pill, {{in order to determine the}} efficacy of the new medication. In recent years, some surgeons have also conducted clinical trials involving sham operations, the equivalent of placebos in the surgical arena. Placebo-controlled trials are of particular concern because of the possible adverse consequences for study participants who could otherwise benefit from receiving active treatment. Some critics of placebo-controlled clinical trials contend that it is always unethical to deprive patients of available therapy. By contrast, proponents of placebos argue that placebo-controlled studies are cheaper, easier to interpret, and provide more definitive results than other study designs. The use of placebo controls raises profound questions regarding the ethical principle of beneficence, that is, the responsibility of physicians to avoid harming patients and to maximize benefits while minimizing risks for human subjects. Other troubling questions relate to personal autonomy and the ability of individuals to provide meaningful consent to participation in research that might require them to forgo beneficial therapy. This article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of placebo controls as well as the many ethical dilemmas associated with their use. It suggests guidelines that elucidate the circumstances in which utilization of placebo controls is appropriate and the factors that militate against their inclusion in studies in particular instances...|$|E
40|$|In 1910, Carl Auer von Welsbach {{noted that}} he had made an {{observation}} of a radioactive substance inducing radioactivity to an <b>inactive</b> <b>substance.</b> From today's point of view, this could have been the first observation of neutron activation. Herein, we present new insights into our investigation of this ‘mysterious observation’ as Auer von Welsbach termed it. We believe that one of the activated objects was a platinum–iridium crucible. The dominating activation product of the crucible could have been iridium- 194. We have discovered several platinum crucibles from Auer's heritage and investigated them by gamma-spectrometry and, one of them, by SEM/EDX. In the EDX investigations, however, no iridium was found in the most promising crucible. Hence this particular crucible was probably not the activated object. In any case, gamma-ray spectrometry revealed very low but detectable amounts of natural radionuclides. This indicated that these crucibles were used by Auer von Welsbach for his radioactive work and that these crucibles were bought prior to World War I. Hence Auer von Welsbach somehow managed to save these crucibles from the noble metal collections during the war. Auer's 1910 publication carried the suffix ‘Part I’, however, Part II was thought to be lost. In our recent work, however, we rediscovered a hand-written manuscript of Part II, in which the peculiar observation is mentioned vaguely. Lastly, we converted Auer's uranium standard into becquerels. Based on this conversion, we estimated that Auer von Welsbach observed an 194 Ir activity of the crucible of 500  kBq. It is further estimated that a (thermal) neutron flux density of approximately 8 E+ 4  cm− 2  s− 1 was needed to activate the crucible in a way to meet Auer's description.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability of}} a patient to {{effectively}} stabilize (lock) and thus prevent rotation of his/her joint against forces applied {{by one of the}} authors (C. F. B.) appears to vary with the nature of the substance with which the patient is in proximity. C. F. B. believes the patient’s nutritional needs can be evaluated by determining which of several substances is most effective in strengthening the weakened patient. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine why such changes in physical strength occur. Bottles of pills were placed one after another on the supine patient’s abdomen and chart recordings of force vs. time were made for the most effective strengthening agent and for an <b>inactive</b> placebo <b>substance</b> as the patient attempted to resist shoulder flexion. In the first set of trials, the tester was unblinded and the patient blinded. These same substances next were placed in opaque cloth bags so that both the tester and the patient were blinded and charted again. Finally, recordings of force vs. time again were made for the strengthening agent and the placebo substance, with the tester unblinded and the patient blinded. The tester, C. F. B., favored a signature hypothesis i...|$|R
40|$|Foreign mRNA was {{expressed}} in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Newly expressed ion currents localized in defined plasma membrane areas were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique {{in combination with}} a specially designed chamber, that exposed {{only part of the}} surface on the oocytes to channel agonists or inhibitors. Newly expressed currents were found to be unequally distributed in the surface membrane of the oocyte. This asymmetry was most pronounced during the early phase of expression, when channels could almost exclusively be detected in the animal hemisphere of the oocyte. 4 d after injection of the mRNA, or later, channels could be found at a threefold higher density at the animal than at the vegetal pole area. The pattern of distribution was observed to be similar with various ion channels expressed from crude tissue mRNA and from cRNAs coding for rat GABAA receptor channel subunits. Electron microscopical analysis revealed very similar microvilli patterns at both oocyte pole areas. Thus, the asymmetric current distribution is not due to asymmetric surface structure. Upon incubation during the expression period in either colchicine or cytochalasin D, the current density was found to be equal in both pole areas. The <b>inactive</b> control <b>substance</b> beta-lumicolchicine had no effect on the asymmetry of distribution. Colchicine was without effect on the amplitude of the expressed whole cell current. Our measurements reveal a pathway for plasma membrane protein expression endogenous to the Xenopus oocyte, that may contribute to the formation and maintenance of polarity of this highly organized cell...|$|R
40|$|Factor VII forming {{activity}} is localized in the post-mitochondrial supernatant (S 30) of normal rat liver (N) homogenates. Neither the microsomal (P 100) nor post-microsomal supernatant (S 100) gives activity, but {{activity is}} recovered upon recombination of P 100 and S 100. Corresponding S 30, P 100 or S 100 from either vitamin K deficient (VKD) or coumarin anticoagulant pretreated (CA) rat liver, show no activity. Incubation of S 100 (N), {{in the presence}} of P 100 (N, VKD or CA) forms factor VII, while S 100 (VKD or CA) incubated {{in the presence of}} P 100 (N) is inactive. The primary defect therefore in vitamin K deficiency or after coumarin anticoagulant pretreatment, resides in the absence or inactivity of a component of the S 100 in either vitamin K deficient or coumarin anticoagulant pretreated rat livers. An enzyme-substrate relation is indicated where the S 100 contains the enzyme and the P 100 the substrate. The activity from S 100 (N) is purified by 270 -fo 1 d after fractionation with 40 - 50 % saturated (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and column chromatography on DEAE Sephadex A- 25. The substrate for this enzyme is localized in the microsomal fraction (P 100) by specific antibody techniques. This antigenic material reacts with immunological identity with either prothrombrin or the functionally <b>inactive</b> prothrombin-like <b>substance</b> (FIPL) found in plasma after vitamin K deficiency, but unlike prothrombrin (but similar to FIPL) the substrate in the P 100, is not adsorbed on BaSO 4. [ [...] . ]Aprés homogénéisation du foie d'un rat normal (N), l'activité responsable de la formation du, facteur VII est localisée dans le surnageant post-mitochondrial (S 30). Ni la fraction microsomique (P 100) ni le surnageant post-microsomique (S 100) ne possèdent d'activité, mais on recouvre l'activité aprés recombination des fraction P 100 et S 100. Dans le cas de rats rendus déficients en vitamine K (VKD), ou préalablement traités avec des anticoagulants du type coumarinque (CA), les fractions S 30 ou P 100 et S 100 ne possèdent pas d'activité. Le facteur VII est produit après incubation de la fraction S 100 (N) avec la fraction P 100 (N, VKD, CA), cependant que la combinaison S 100 (VKD, CA) avec P 100 (N) reste inactive. L'anomalie produite par une déficience en vitamine K ou une administration d'anticoagulants coumarinique semble donc prendre la forme de l'absence ou de l'inactivité d'une composante de la fraction S 100 du foie de rat.
