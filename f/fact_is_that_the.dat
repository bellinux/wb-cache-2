25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things.

But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue.

25|$|Historians {{have long}} debated {{how and why}} many Bosnians {{converted}} to Islam. There is no simple answer to this question, and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. One important <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans did not, as a rule, actively seek to convert their Christian subjects to Islam (the many generations it took for Bosnia to become predominantly Muslim and the retaining of Slavic customs among converts testify to this). The Ottoman Empire {{at the time was}} centered on militaristic expansion independent of religion, and the primary split was not between Muslims and nonbelievers but between the military-administrative class (the Ottomans) and various classes of serfs (known as rayah), neither of which was exclusive to any particular faith. Though the state eventually acquired a more Islamic focus, by this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.|$|E
500|$|Staunton {{has been}} a {{controversial}} figure ever since his own time. In the words of chess journalist Mark Weeks, [...] "Staunton represents a unique challenge to chess history. Many players immediately associate his name with Paul Morphy, as in 'Staunton ducked a match with Morphy'.... This is extremely unfair, as it concentrates the focus on Staunton to a relatively minor, factually controversial incident, while it ignores his significant achievements." [...] As chess historian Edward Winter writes, [...] "The issue of national bias does, unfortunately, require consideration in the Staunton–Morphy affair." [...] Chess historian Dale Brandreth makes a similar point, from an American perspective: [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British have always had their 'thing' about Morphy. They just can't seem to accept that Staunton was an unmitigated bastard in his treatment of Morphy because he knew damned well he could never have made any decent showing against him in a match." [...] However, Frederick Edge (1830–82) and Philip W. Sergeant (1872–1952), two of Staunton's harshest critics, were British, while former world champion Bobby Fischer (1943–2008), {{one of the biggest}} fans of both Staunton and Morphy, was American.|$|E
500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, but the <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French are good at plunder").|$|E
2500|$|The {{conclusion}} one may easily {{draw from}} these <b>facts</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament merely focuses on chronicling certain Persian kings rather than others.

This would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> author did not find the missing Persian kings to be noteworthy—hence their absence from the text.|$|R
