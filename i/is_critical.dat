Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More importantly, {{he laid out}} his belief in Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
50|$|Sowell <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> {{of schools}} of {{education}} for training the future teachers in educational fads and having low overall standards, and <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> of states requiring people to have credentials from schools of education to take teaching jobs.|$|R

Miller, Paul Varnell, and Norah Vincent--covered {{a wide range of}} topics and did not have one political message. Some authors <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of how the gay rights movement was trying to achieve its goals, some <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of certain goals such as hate crime laws, and others <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of both the ends and the means.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Smith beyond what she writes of herself in the preface. She spent her life working as a cook or {{housekeeper}} in wealthy households, and unlike Elizabeth Raffald who left service to run her own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book. It is possible that she worked at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire. She <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E

For instance, the concentrated {{protein solution}} that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> to its renowned strength.

5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause <b>is</b> <b>critical,</b> as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
5|$|Mark McNeilly {{writes in}} Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare that a modern {{interpretation}} of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> in understanding China's push {{to becoming a}} superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and The Art of War in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} uses {{in vitro}} biological assays such as PCR-ELISA or Fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, {{that is a}} marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. Preservation of the sample before analysis <b>is</b> <b>critical.</b> Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it is vulnerable to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated in preservation agents.|$|E

5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other.

5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E

He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
