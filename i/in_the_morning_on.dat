5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna left early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> 12 June 1859. By {{the end of the}} same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal before the law. In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied.

His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury.

5|$|Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José {{and dropped}} napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , {{which was on}} charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial {{role to play in}} the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} forward from Waigani to {{enable it to}} join the {{fighting}} later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 2/9th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 28 August. At around 4:30pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy– consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers– and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters. Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> 29 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} {{returning}} to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>on</b> 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd {{was buried in the}} nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall (see box) bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost the same age as her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth (1790), as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later (1797), as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte (1807) and Henry (1813). Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was thought this was a hereditary weakness carried by the family.|$|E
