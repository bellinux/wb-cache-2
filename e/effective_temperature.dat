5|$|HIP 78530 is a bright, blue B-type main {{sequence}} {{star in the}} Upper Scorpius association, a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin. The star {{is estimated to be}} approximately 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years, however a more recent estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older (approximately 11 million years old). Its <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> is estimated at 10500 K, less than twice the <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Sun.|$|E
40|$|Considering {{features}} of stellar spectral radiation and survey explorers, we established a computational model for stellar <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures,</b> detected angular parameters, and gray rates. Using known stellar flux data in some band, we estimated stellar <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> and detected angular parameters using stochastic {{particle swarm optimization}} (SPSO). We first verified the reliability of SPSO, and then determined reasonable parameters that produced highly accurate estimates under certain gray deviation levels. Finally, we calculated 177, 860 stellar <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> and detected angular parameters using the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) catalog data. These derived stellar <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> were accurate when we compared them to known values from literatures. This research made full use of catalog data and presented an original technique for studying stellar characteristics. It proposed a novel method for calculating stellar <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> and detected angular parameters, and provided theoretical and practical data support for finding radiation flow information for any band.

40|$|Some {{selected}} catalogs of the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> for F, G and K {{stars are}} analyzed. By an improved technique we estimate the external errors of these catalogs from data intercomparisons. The {{values of the}} <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> are then averaged with the appropriate weights to produce a mean homogeneous catalog based on the selected data. This catalog, containing 800 stars, is compared with some other independent catalogs for estimating their external errors. The data {{may be used as}} a source of reliable homogeneous values of <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures,</b> together with their errors. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> of late A {{and early}} F stars are {{determined}} from the observed fluxes {{in the visual}} at 1900 A and 1420 A. The observed ratios are compared with those calculated by Kurucz (1979). A correction of the theoretical fluxes at 1900 A brings the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> obtained from different ratios into reasonable agreement. The <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> determined in this way for late A stars agree well with those obtained from the optical region. For F stars, however, the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> obtained from the UV {{are found to be}} higher than those obtained from the optical region if radiative equilibrium models are used for the comparison. It is thought that this discrepancy may derive from the effects of temperature, pressure, and absorption coefficient inhomogeneities caused by convection...|$|R
5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye from the perspective of someone on Earth. The star's <b>effective</b> <b>temperature,</b> at 5826 K, is hotter than that of the Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E
5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures,</b> angular diameters, distances, and linear diameters {{that have}} been determined for 160 O and B stars {{on the basis of}} published UV spectrophotometry, visible and near-IR intermediate-band photometry, and model-atmosphere fluxes. The results are compared with previous measurements and calculations for main-sequence and giant O and B stars. It is found that: (1) the flux <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> of O and B supergiants are systematically lower than those of main-sequence and giant stars of the same subtype; (2) the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> and radii of Beta Cep stars are the same as those of nonvariable stars of the same spectral type; (3) Be stars that do not have two Balmer jumps have <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> very similar to those of normal B stars of the same subtype; (4) O and B stars increase in size from the main sequence to supergiants; and (5) late B supergiants are approximately twice as large as O 9 supergiants...|$|R
5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|White dwarfs {{whose primary}} {{spectral}} classification is DA have hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. They {{make up the}} majority (approximately 80%) of all observed white dwarfs. The next class in number is of DBs (approximately 16%). The hot (above 15,000K) DQ class (roughly 0.1%) have carbon-dominated atmospheres. Those classified as DB, DC, DO, DZ, and cool DQ have helium-dominated atmospheres. Assuming that carbon and metals are not present, which spectral classification is seen depends on the <b>effective</b> <b>temperature.</b> Between approximately 100,000 K to 45,000 K, the spectrum will be classified DO, dominated by singly ionized helium. From 30,000K to 12,000K, the spectrum will be DB, showing neutral helium lines, and below about 12,000K, the spectrum will be featureless and classified DC.,§ 2.4.|$|E
25|$|The Sun closely approximates a black-body radiator. The <b>effective</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{defined by}} the total {{radiative}} power per square unit, is about 5780K. The color temperature of sunlight above the atmosphere is about 5900K.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the Sun {{as a result of}} cyclic changes of the global magnetic field is studied.

40|$|Reported are UBV and uvbybeta {{observations}} of 15 candidates for Kepler primary astero- seismic targets and 14 other {{stars in the}} Kepler field, carried out at the M. G. Fracastoro station of the Catania Astrophysical Observatory. These data serve to plot the 29 stars in two-parameter diagrams with the photometric indices (such as B-V or delta m 1 and the atmospheric parameters (such as the MK type or [Fe/H]) as coordinates. The two-parameter diagrams show no evidence of interstellar reddening. The photometric indices B-V and beta are then used to derive photometric <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures,</b> Teff(B-V) and Teff(beta). For Teff(B-V) > 6400 K, the photometric <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{turn out to be}} systematically higher than spectroscopic <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> by 311 +/- 34 K and 346 +/- 91 K for Teff(B-V) and Teff(beta), respectively.

40|$|Non-thermal {{correlations}} of strongly correlated electron {{systems and the}} far-from-equilibrium properties of phases of condensed matter have become a topical research area. Here, {{an overview of the}} nonlinear dynamics found near continuous zero-temperature phase transitions within the context of <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> is presented. In particular, we focus on models of critical Kondo destruction. Such a quantum critical state, where Kondo screening is destroyed in a critical fashion, is realized in a number of rare earth intermetallics. This raises the possibility of experimentally testing for the existence of fluctuation-dissipation relations far from equilibrium in terms of <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Finally, we present an analysis of a non-interacting, critical reference system, the pseudogap resonant level model, in terms of <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> and contrast these results with those obtained near interacting quantum critical points.

25|$|In {{a vacuum}} or in outer space, {{there is no}} {{convective}} heat transfer, thus in these environments, radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment. For a satellite in space, a 100°C (373 Kelvin) surface facing the sun will absorb a lot of radiant heat, because the sun's surface temperature is nearly 6000 Kelvin, whereas the same surface facing deep-space will radiate a lot of heat, since deep-space has an <b>effective</b> <b>temperature</b> {{of only a few}} Kelvin.|$|E
25|$|Brown dwarfs, whose energy {{comes from}} {{gravitational}} attraction alone, cool {{as they age}} and so progress to later spectral types. Brown dwarfs start their lives with M-type spectra and will cool through the L, T, and Y spectral classes; faster the less massive they are—the highest-mass brown dwarfs cannot have cooled to Y or even T dwarfs within {{the age of the}} universe.

40|$|I {{study the}} space-time {{evolution}} of transverse flow and <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{in the dense}} parton phase with the string melting version of a multi-phase transport model. Parameters of the model are first constrained to reproduce the bulk data on the rapidity density, p_ T spectrum and elliptic flow at low p_ T for central and mid-central Au+Au collisions at 200 A GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2760 A GeV. I then calculate the transverse flow and <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> in volume cells within mid-spacetime-rapidity |η|< 1 / 2. I find that the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> extracted from different variables, which are all evaluated in the rest frame of a volume cell, can be very different; this indicates that the parton system in the model is not in full chemical or thermal equilibrium locally, even after averaging over many events. In particular, the <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> extracted from the parton energy density or number density are often quite different than those extracted from the parton mean p_ T or mean energy. For these collisions in general, <b>effective</b> <b>temperatures</b> extracted from the parton energy density or number density are higher than those extracted from the parton mean p_ T in the inner part of the overlap volume, while the opposite occurs in the outer part of the overlap volume.
