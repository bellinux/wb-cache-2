5|$|Tallon {{played a}} key role in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. He came in at 7/86 and made ten in the first innings to push Australia to 101 in reply to Yorkshire's 71, in which Tallon did not concede a bye. However, Tallon was not so tidy in the second innings, conceding 11 byes as the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings. He did not make a {{dismissal}} in the match. Australia then collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory when Tallon strode <b>in.</b> <b>To</b> <b>make</b> matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia only had three wickets in hand. Australia faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. He survived an immediate leg before wicket appeal and then hit a shot that fell just short of a fielder. He then compiled 17 unbeaten runs as Australia scraped home by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was {{shouldering}} most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18years.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{eventually}} {{signed for}} Roma {{on the final}} day of the 2004 summer transfer window, for a fee of €6million, signing a five-year contract. It was confirmed that he would miss the opening game of the season, and possibly the following two games. Mido was penciled <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his Roma debut against Messina in September 2004, a game in which he did actually play, but Roma lost 4–3. Reports suggested that Mido could be sold to Valencia in a swap deal with Bernardo Corradi and was also linked with a move to Premier League side Manchester City. Southampton were believed to have had Mido on their shortlist of targets, but his agent Christophe Henrotay said Roma would not be willing to let Mido leave the club. It was even reported that he had been offered to Southampton on loan but his new agent, Mino Raiola, repeated the earlier claims that Roma wanted to keep Mido until, at least, the end of the season. He was linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, with his agent confirming he wanted a move away from Roma.|$|E

25|$|The {{facade of}} the cloister has two levels and is fronted by an arched porch area, called a portería.

The portería contains the main entrance to the cloister area, above which is a crucifix set on top of a skull, which represents Calvary. The foyer of this entrance used to serve as a baptistery in the late 19th and early 20th century. The paintings here are from that era.

25|$|Rain wrecked {{the match}} at Headingley, a match which would {{probably}} have ended in a result if the normal 400 overs of play were possible instead of the 221.4 actually available. Although no batsman passed 50, Worcestershire accumulated 308 in 85 overs. Tim Bresnan took three wickets for 45 with his pace, while Australian Mark Cleary, playing {{in his first game}} for Yorkshire after a season with Leicestershire in 2004, had to be content with one man - Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar - while conceding 70. Anthony McGrath batted almost without support in Yorkshire's first innings, but his five-hour unbeaten 173 sent Yorkshire to a total of 317, despite struggling at 190 for 7 before Richard Dawson stepped <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 49. Kabir Ali took four for 79 for Worcestershire, Nadeem Malik got three and Gareth Batty two, but they couldn't prevent the hosts racking up a nine-run lead.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, {{the title}} Squire of Seacroft {{was held by}} the Wilson family: the last member of which was Squire Darcy Bruce Wilson. According to the 1891 census, he lived at Seacroft Hall with his sister, Louisa, and five servants: a footman, cook, kitchen maid and two housemaids. He was a Master of Arts, Barrister at Law, Justice of the peace, and a captain in the Yorkshire Hussars. After his death at Seacroft Hall in 1936, his nephew sold the family estate to Leeds Corporation one year later. The hall was {{demolished}} in1953, and its ornamental lake was filled <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way for Parklands Girls' High School. Templar Villas, a cluster of semi-detached Victorian houses, was built on Templar Lane/Barwick Road before1893, and a row of large houses was built on Templar Lane before 1908.

25|$|Sthalekar was {{retained}} for the Second Test at Bankstown Oval in {{her home}} town Sydney, but after her failure as an opener in the preceding match, {{she returned to her}} conventional position in the middle-order. In the restructuring in the batting line-up, Kris Britt was called <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her Test debut as an opener alongside Clark, and middle-order batsman Michelle Goszko was omitted to accommodate Sthalekar. Australia batted first and collapsed to be 3/25, bringing Sthalekar in to join Mel Jones. Sthalekar made 18 from 94 balls, combining with Jones for a 65-run partnership in 99 minutes to steady the innings. She was then dismissed by Pearson, triggering an Australian collapsed to 134 all out, losing their last seven wickets for 44 runs. She then took 0/21 and ran out Kathryn Leng with a throw to Price as the tourists took a 53-run lead. However, Australia's top-order again capitulated, and Sthalekar came to the crease at 3/36; the score then became 4/49 when Jones fell. Sthalekar then combined with Alex Blackwell to take Australia out of trouble, putting on 136 for the fifth wicket before the latter fell for 58. Sthalekar ended with an unbeaten 120, including four fours, from six hours of batting, as Australia declared at 7/259. Sthalekar then took 1/26 from 18 overs, removing Leng lbw, as England ended the match at 6/133 to avoid a defeat.|$|E

25|$|Despite rain {{washing out}} {{parts of the}} first day at New Road, England took their first Test victory over Australia since December 1984, and their first Ashes series win since 1963. Having won the toss, England captain Clare Connor opted to bowl, and after Belinda Clark had slashed 18 runs she was trapped lbw by pacer Katherine Brunt. Wickets were shared out among the entire England team, no Australian passed 40, {{and by the end of}} the day they had crashed to 126 for 7. It took 33 {{deliveries}} for Australia to be all out on the second morning - for 131, as the efforts from the last Test, when the last three wickets outscored the rest of the batting line-up, were not repeated. Brunt took care of that, having Nitschke and Price caught behind to complete her five-wicket-haul. Batting was clearly difficult, but Jenny Gunn, Clare Connor and Claire Taylor all dug <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> scores above 30, before a vital partnership between Taylor and Beth Morgan took England to a relatively comfortable lead, as they moved to 196 for 6 before Emma Liddell struck twice and Cathryn Fitzpatrick once to leave England at 222 for 9 at close of play of day two. Liddell and Fitzpatrick bowled 59 overs between them on the second day, out of a total of 101, and although they shared seven wickets, they failed to remove either of Brunt or Isa Guha, and the last English pair added 18 before the end of day two.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Wally Edwards saw {{off the new}} {{ball and}} were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was {{declined}} by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs {{in less than an}} hour when Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans as he left the field, as well they might as he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out first thing the next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared things up with 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.|$|E
