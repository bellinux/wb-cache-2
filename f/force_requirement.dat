5|$|To {{fulfill the}} Air <b>Force</b> <b>requirement</b> for {{all-weather}} attack, Republic proposed the F-105D variant in 1957. This version featured an enlarged nose and radome housing the AN/ASG-19 Thunderstick bombing/navigation system. The AN/ASG-19 was designed around the Autonetics R-14A radar, which operated in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, and the AN/APN-131 Doppler navigation radar. In the cockpit, the F-105D featured vertical-tape instrument displays for adverse weather operation. The {{ability to carry}} the TX-43 nuclear weapon was also added. The RF-105 reconnaissance development was also restarted, now based on the F-105D. The first D-model took its maiden flight on 9 June 1959. Plans to build over 1,500 F-105Ds were cut short when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided to equip no more than seven combat wings with the type. In November 1961, production was cut {{in favor of the}} Air Force adopting the Navy's F-4 Phantom II, and in the longer term, the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark of the TFX program.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Air Force and Navy {{were both}} seeking new {{aircraft}} when Robert McNamara was appointed Secretary of Defense in January 1961. The aircraft {{sought by the}} two armed services shared the need to carry heavy armament and fuel loads, feature high supersonic speed, twin engines and two seats, and probably use variable geometry wings. On 14 February 1961, McNamara formally directed the services to study {{the development of a}} single aircraft that would satisfy both requirements. Early studies indicated that the best option was to base the design on the Air <b>Force</b> <b>requirement,</b> and use a modified version for the Navy. In June 1961, Secretary McNamara ordered the go ahead of Tactical Fighter Experimental (TFX), despite Air Force and Navy efforts to keep their programs separate.|$|E

Development of the CV-22 Osprey stems directly from the 1980 failed Iran hostage rescue attempt. After three decades of development and testing, the CV-22 passed its final exam with the completion of initial operational test and evaluation flown by the 8th SOS crew. The CV-22 fulfills the unique Air <b>Force</b> <b>requirement</b> for a platform capable of long-range, infiltration and exfiltration to targets located anywhere in the world. With the combined ability to fly at C-130 speeds and land to austere landing areas like a helicopter, the Osprey brings a revolutionary capability to combatant commanders.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he agrees}} {{that it would}} take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a {{standing}} cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human. Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons, Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined <b>force</b> <b>requirement,</b> he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. [...] "If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity", he says, [...] "about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} modified variants was the Westland Commando, operated by the Royal Navy as the HC4. [...] The Commando had capacity for up to 28 fully equipped troops and had originally been developed to meet an Egyptian Air <b>Force</b> <b>requirement.</b> Due to the deletion of the amphibious capability, not required in the Egyptian desert, the most noticeable change from the Sea King was the deletion of the side floats, the main undercarriage being carried on stub sponsons. An improved variant of the Egyptian Commando, with changes including the fitting of folding blades common to the ASW variants, was designated as the Sea King HC4 by the Royal Navy and all the aircraft were new build. First flying on 26 September 1979, [...] due to its operational range of up to 600 nautical miles without refuelling, the HC4 'Commando' became an important asset for amphibious warfare and troop transport duties, in particular. Several Royal Naval Air Squadrons have operated the Commando variant, such as 845 Naval Air Squadron, 846 Naval Air Squadron and 848 Naval Air Squadron. In British service, the Sea King HC4 was deployed on operations in the Falklands, the Balkans, both Gulf Wars, Sierra Leone, Lebanon and Afghanistan. Towards {{the end of the}} Sea King's operational life, several HAS6s were repurposed by the removal of the ASW equipment, as troop transports. In 2010, the last of the UK's converted ASW Sea Kings to troop transports were retired.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResearch on motor {{imagery and}} action {{observation}} {{has become increasingly}} important in recent years particularly because of its potential benefits for movement rehabilitation and the optimization of athletic performance (Munzert et al., 2009). Motor execution, motor imagery, and action observation {{have been shown to}} rely largely on a similar neural network in motor and motor-related cortical areas (Jeannerod, 2001). Given that motor imagery is a covert stage of an action and its characteristics, it has been assumed that modifying the motor task in terms of, for example, effort will impact neural activity. With this background, the present study examined how different <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> influence corticospinal excitability (CSE) and intracortical facilitation during motor imagery and action observation of a repetitive movement (dynamic force production). Participants were instructed to kinesthetically imagine or observe an abduction/adduction movement of the right index finger that differed in terms of <b>force</b> <b>requirements.</b> Trials were carried out with single- or paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Surface electromyography was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM). As expected, results showed a significant main effect on mean peak-to-peak motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes in FDI but no differences in MEP amplitudes in ADM muscle. Participants’ mean peak-to-peak MEPs increased when the <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> (movement effort) of the imagined or observed action were increased. This reveals an impact of the imagined and observed <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> of repetitive movements on CSE. It is concluded that this effect might be due to stronger motor neuron recruitment for motor imagery and action observation with an additional load. That would imply that the modification of motor parameters in movements such as <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> modulates CSE...|$|R

2500|$|The {{origins of}} SC-21 {{lie in the}} {{realization}} by Admiral Joseph Metcalf III that new technologies such as vertical launch missiles permitted a complete rethink of warship design. He established a steering group, Group Mike, to study the possibilities. Group Mike sponsored two studies in 1987: the Ship Operational Characteristics Study (SOCS) and the Surface Combatant <b>Force</b> <b>Requirement</b> Study (SCFRS). Respectively, these studies sought to identify the operational characteristics required of an escort ship and estimate how many such ships were required by the fleet. Since it was expected {{at that time that}} the Navy would be fighting prolonged campaigns in the Norwegian Sea, SOCS put an emphasis on ships' continuing ability to fight after an initial Soviet attack. This in turn called for larger, more survivable escort ships than had historically been the norm, around 12,000tons, and for networking sensors and weapons together so that they could be used by the task force as a whole even if an individual ship had their radar disabled. Survivability also called for the bridge and Combat Information Center to be combined and [...] "buried" [...] {{in the heart of the}} ship, and for the ship to use electric drive to distribute the engineering around the ship. This would provide more room for weapons as well as the scope for future weapons such as railguns and lasers. SCFRS suggested that the Navy should not replace the Perry class frigate for convoy escort duties, but concentrate on building front-line combatants that could be assigned to less demanding convoy duties in their later years.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A decisive {{criterion}} for {{the selection of}} the optimal press line within the press shop's layout plan is the required press force. The press force necessary to form the component is defined significantly by the stroke range and the corresponding bottom dead centre. The latter finalises the embossing process commonly used for reinforced structures on body components. The high forces required hereby strongly impact the deformation behaviour of the tool and the press and result in <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> specific to individual presses. This paper examines the significant influences on the maximum <b>force</b> <b>requirements.</b> Examinations of the <b>force</b> <b>requirements</b> using parameter studies on bending, bulge test as well as embossing tests will be presented. The impact of the presses and tools rigidity was determined by way of extensive measurements performed on a mechanical and on a hydraulic press. The decisive criterion here is the bottom dead centre, which can be reproducibly determined using a simple and reliable measurement technique...|$|R
