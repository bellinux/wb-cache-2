40|$|Abstract. Causeway {{provides}} runtime {{support for}} the development of distributed meta-applications. These meta-applications control or analyze the behavior of multi-tier distributed applications such as multi-tier web sites or web services. Examples of meta-applications include multitier debugging, fault diagnosis, resource tracking, prioritization, and security enforcement. Efficient online implementation of these meta-applications requires meta-data to be passed between the different program components. Examples of metadata corresponding to the above meta-applications are request <b>identifiers,</b> priorities or <b>security</b> principal <b>identifiers.</b> Causeway provides the infrastructure for injecting, destroying, reading, and writing such metadata. The key functionality in Causeway is forwarding the metadata associated with a request at so-called transfer points, where the execution of that request gets passed from one component to another. This is done automatically for system-visible channels, such as pipes or sockets. An API is provided to implement the forwarding of metadata at system-opaque channels such as shared memory. We describe the design and implementation of Causeway, and we evaluate its usability and performance. Causeway’s low overhead allows it to be present permanently in production systems. We demonstrate its usability by showing how to implement, in 150 lines of code and without modification to the application, global priority enforcement in a multitier dynamic web server. ...|$|R
40|$|Issues in <b>Identifier</b> Comparison for <b>Security</b> Purposes <b>Identifiers</b> such as hostnames, URIs, IP {{addresses}}, and {{email addresses}} {{are often used}} in security contexts to identify security principals and resources. In such contexts, an identifier presented via some protocol is often compared using some policy to make security decisions such as whether the security principal may access the resource, what level of authentication or encryption is required, etc. If the parties involved in a security decision use different algorithms to compare identifiers, then failure scenarios ranging from denial of service to elevation of privilege can result. This document provides a discussion of these issues that designers should consider when defining identifiers and protocols, and when constructing architectures that use multiple protocols.
