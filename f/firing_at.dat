5|$|Scott—still unsure who his {{ships were}} <b>firing</b> <b>at,</b> and {{afraid that they}} might be firing on his own destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied. Scott ordered Farenholt to flash her recognition signals and upon observing that Farenholt was close to his formation, he ordered the fire resumed at 23:51.|$|E
5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its history, the {{community}} has faced a number of fires. In addition to the 1849 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> St. Joseph Prairie, there was a 1955 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the infirmary at the Dubuque motherhouse, a 1958 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Our Lady of the Angels (a BVM grammar school in Chicago), and a 1984 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Clarke College.|$|R

5|$|Between 4 and 12 July, New Jersey {{supported}} a United Nations push in the Kansong area, <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As the Republic of Korea's First Division hurled {{itself on the}} enemy, shore fire control observers saw New Jerseys salvos hit directly on enemy mortar emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. New Jersey returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|Italian gun {{positions}} were located using sound ranging by the British 6th Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery. These positions disclosed themselves by <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and {{the barbed wire}} obstacles. Aerial photographs of the {{positions were}} taken by Westland Lysander aircraft of No. 208 Squadron RAF, escorted by Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. British Intelligence estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.|$|E

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E

5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5000|$|Several fires {{erupted in}} late November, {{including}} a major <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Forcett, in which 11 firefighters were evacuated with injuries after a wind change. [...] There were other fires, {{such as the}} one at Glenlusk on the outskirts of Hobart and another major <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Poatina in the Central Lakes district. The <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Forcett was rapidly bought under control, while the one at Glenlusk posed serious danger to houses and farms (and actually destroyed several vehicles and shacks). The <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Poatina Road in the Central Lakes District was burning out of control two weeks later and was only bought under control in the middle of January.|$|R

5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons <b>firing</b> <b>at</b> aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E
50|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Camino La Pólvora was worsened {{by another}} <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Fundo Las Cenizas, which forced the {{authorities}} to request interregional support of firefighters.

They dived for cover behind some mattresses, but the grenades did not detonate. One of the prisoners was also said to have got hold of a rifle according to one of the guards, which he levelled and <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the guard commander as he entered the room, but missed. The prisoner then turned the rifle and <b>fired</b> another shot <b>at</b> another guard.

The guard commander also claimed to have dropped McKee. He then said he saw Clancy with a shovel, and that Clancy was attempting to strike another guard. One of the guards (who had dived behind the mattresses) then <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Clancy and he fell. A fourth witness was to tell much the same story.|$|R
