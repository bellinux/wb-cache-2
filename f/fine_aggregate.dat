25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or <b>fine</b> <b>aggregate</b> (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E

50|$|The Fineness modulus (FM) is an {{empirical}} figure obtained {{by adding the}} total percentage of the sample of an aggregate retained on each of a specified series of sieves, and dividing the sum by 100. The sieve sizes are 150μ, 300μ, 600μ, 1.18 mm, 2.36 mm, 4.75 mm, 9.5 mm, 19.0 mm, 38.1 mm and larger increasing in the ratio of 2:1. The same value of fineness modulus may therefore be obtained from several different particle size distributions. In general, however, a smaller value indicates a <b>finer</b> <b>aggregate.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> range from a FM of 2.00 to 4.00, and coarse aggregates smaller than 38.1 mm range from 6.50 to 8.00.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to compare the properties of concretes prepared with the use river sand, crushed fine stone (CFS), furnace bottom ash (FBA), and <b>fine</b> recycled <b>aggregate</b> (FRA) as <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Two methods were used to design the concrete mixes: (i) fixed water-cement ratio (W/C) and (ii) fixed slump ranges. The investigation included testing of compressive strength, drying shrinkage and resistance to chloride-ion penetration of the concretes. The test results showed that, at fixed water-cement ratios, the compressive strength and the drying shrinkage decreased with the increase in the FBA content. FRA decreased the compressive strength and increased the drying shrinkage of the concrete. However, when designing the concrete mixes with a fixed slump value, at all the test ages, when FBA was used as the <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> to replace natural aggregates, the concrete had higher compressive strength, lower drying shrinkage and higher resistance to the chloride-ion penetration. But the use of FRA led to a reduction in compressive strength but increase in shrinkage values.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reported}} on an experimental program {{to research the}} effect of using blasted copper slag from shipyard repair and maintenance as replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in the sand-cement brick. 20 cubes of cement sand brick mixtures were produced with different blasted copper slag ratio ranging from 0 % (for the control mixture) to 60 %. All the sand-cement brick mixtures were tested for their compressive strength, density and water absorption at day 28 of air curing. There was a 16. 28 % improvement in the compressive strength of brick with 20 % replacement of copper slag as <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in comparison with control mixture. However, the addition of higher percentage of blasted copper slag as <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> resulted in reduction of compressive strength but the density was increased. Also, the results of water absorption decreased as copper slag ratios in brick increases. The water absorption for 60 % of copper slag ratio in brick was the lowest absorption compared to 20 % of copper slag to sand ratio in brick. Hence, {{it is recommended that}} 0 % to 20 % of blasted copper slag may be used as a replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in order to obtain a good strength and low density of sand-cement brick.

The density and water absorption of the recycled aggregates was determined and a model for predicting water absorption over time is proposed. Both natural and recycled aggregates were characterized regarding bulk density and <b>fines</b> content. Recycled <b>aggregates</b> were additionally characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS and DTA/TG of individual size fractions. The results show that natural and recycled <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> have very different characteristics.

Petrographic Number of Sand has been quantified to estimate the durability of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> for Portland cement and asphaltic concrete works. Forty <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates,</b> taken from various locations in southern Ontario, were used in testing. A statistical analysis of the test results was performed using the SPSS statistical software (SPSS/PC- 4. 0). From the analysis, it is concluded that {{as the amount of}} deleterious material (such as shale, chert and cemented particles) in the sand increases, the micro-deval abrasion loss (MDA) increases. Freeze-thaw loss factor (FTF) depends on the aggregate cement bond. The good aggregate-cement bond can be attributed to surface roughness and angularity of manufactured carbonate sand particles. It is also found that the micro-deval abrasion test is consistent and reliable because the present test results correlated well with previous test results on natural sand samples from the same locations. Also petrographic analysis is very useful in predicting the quality of natural sands (<b>fine</b> <b>aggregates).</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Geology and Geological Engineering.

This studied were used the different percentage of palm kernel shell as a partial replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete at 1 %, 2 %, and 3 % by volume of sand. Palm kernel shells are derived from the oil palm tree (elaeis guineensis), an economically valuable tree because of its oil. Palm kernel shells {{have been used as}} aggregates in light and dense concretes for structural and non-structural purposes. Palm kernel shell were obtained from the Lepar Hilir palm oil mill and sieved with size between l. 5 mm to 2. 36 mm. The objectives of this final year project are to determine the workability, compressive strength and also flexural strength of concrete when adding with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of palm kernel shell as a replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete. All of the testing were followed the British standard. The workability of concrete were tested by using slump test to check the consistency of freshly made concrete. For compressive strength total of 27 cubes with size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were used to determine the compressive strength of concrete when replace with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of palm kernel shell as a replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete. Then for flexural strength total of 27 beams with size 100 mm x 100 mm × 500 mm were used to determine the flexural strength of concrete when replace with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of palm kernel shell as a replacement of <b>fine</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete. Compressive and flexural strength were conducted at 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days to get the strength of concrete. All of the testing were compared with normal concrete.
