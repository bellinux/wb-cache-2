U.S. counterterrorism forces deployed at bases in Kandahar and Jalalabad and the Bagram air base outside Kabul {{will be able to}} target al-Qaeda forces and forces of the Islamic State, while U.S. advisers can continue to work with key Afghan units, such as air and Special Operations forces, to blunt Taliban attacks.|$|E

John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that John knows of the betrayal. John nonetheless pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board.

[...] It states the parties’ [...] "intention of protecting U.S. and Afghan national interests without U.S. military counter-terrorism operations" [...] but does not specifically prohibit such operations. United States Special Operations forces will retain leeway to conduct antiterrorism raids on private Afghan homes American counterterrorism operations will be intended to [...] "complement and support" [...] Afghan missions and that US forces will not conduct military operations in Afghanistan [...] "unless mutually agreed" [...] the text says.

[...] Obama {{wrote in a letter to}} his Afghan counterpart: [...] "US forces shall not enter Afghan homes for the purposes of military operations, except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of US nationals.

In January 2007, {{as part of his}} overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the [...] "surge" [...] of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that [...] "security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security <b>Forces,</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the focus of the military effort." [...] He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods.

2500|$|On 14 April 2013, Nicolas Maduro won {{the presidential}} {{election}} with 50.6% of the vote, ahead of the 49.1% of candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, surprisingly close compared to previous polls. Opposition leaders made accusations of fraud shortly after the election and Capriles {{refused to accept the}} results, alleging that voters had been coerced to vote for Maduro and claiming election irregularities. The National Electoral Council (CNE), which conducted a post-election audit of a random selection of 54% of the votes, comparing electronic records with paper ballots, claimed to find nothing suspicious. Capriles initially called for an audit of the remaining 46% of the votes, asserting that this would show that he had won the election. The CNE agreed to carry out an audit, and planned to do so in May. Later Capriles changed his mind, adding demands for a full audit of the electoral registry, and calling the audit process “a joke”. Before the government agreed to a full audit of the vote, there were public protests by opponents of Maduro. The crowds were ultimately dispersed by National Guard members using tear gas and rubber bullets. President Maduro responded to the protests by saying, “If you want to try to oust us through a coup, the people and the armed <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> waiting for you.” [...] The clashes resulted in 7 people killed and dozens injured. President Maduro described the protests as a [...] "coup" [...] attempt, and blamed the United States for them. Finally, Capriles told protesters to stop and not play the [...] "government's game," [...] so {{there would be no more}} deaths. On 12 June 2013 the results of the partial audit were announced. The CNE certified the initial results and confirmed Maduro's electoral victory.|$|E
