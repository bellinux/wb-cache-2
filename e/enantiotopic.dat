In this and many other modes of intramolecular Heck cyclization, annulations typically produce a cis ring juncture.(6)6-Exo cyclization is also common. The high stability of Heck reaction catalysts permits the synthesis of highly strained compounds at elevated temperatures. In the example below, the arene and alkene must both be in energetically unfavorable axial positions in order to react.(7)Endo cyclization is observed most often when small or large rings are involved. For instance, 5-endo cyclization is generally preferred over 4-exo cyclization. The yield of endo product increases with increasing ring size in the synthesis of cycloheptenes, -octenes, and -nonenes.(8)Tandem reactions initiated by IMHR have been extensively explored.

On the other hand, the stereochemical outcome is reversed with ee selectivities of up to 83% by using the homologue amino acid catalysts, such as (S)-β-homoproline, acetic acid.

5000|$|The first {{enantioselective}} {{chemical synthesis}} {{is most often}} attributed to Willy Marckwald, Universität zu Berlin, for a brucine-catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylation of 2-ethyl-2-methylmalonic acid reported in 1904. A slight excess of the levorotary form of {{the product of the}} reaction, 2-methylbutyric acid, was produced; as this product is also a natural product—e.g., as a side chain of lovastatin formed by its diketide synthase (LovF) during its biosynthesis—this result constitutes the first recorded total synthesis with enantioselectivity, as well other firsts (as Koskinen notes, first [...] "example of asymmetric catalysis, <b>enantiotopic</b> selection, and organocatalysis"). This observation is also of historical significance, as at the time enantioselective synthesis could only be understood in terms of vitalism. Natural and artificial compounds were fundamentally different, it was argued, and chirality could only exist in natural compounds. Unlike Fischer, Marckwald had performed an enantioselective reaction upon an achiral, un-natural starting material, albeit with a chiral organocatalyst (as we now understand this chemistry).|$|E
50|$|Stereochemistry {{also plays}} a role {{assigning}} faces to trigonal molecules such as ketones. A nucleophile in a nucleophilic addition can approach the carbonyl group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks acetone, both faces are identical and {{there is only one}} reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks butanone, the faces are not identical (<b>enantiotopic)</b> and a racemic product results. When the nucleophile is a chiral molecule diastereoisomers are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called diastereotopic. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (R or S) also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the re-faces and si-faces. In the example displayed on the right, the compound acetophenone is viewed from the re face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the S-enantiomer and attack from the opposite Si face will give the R-enantiomer. However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the re-face will not always lead to an S stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from. In the above-mentioned example, if chloride (Cl-) was added to the prochiral center from the re-face, this would result in an R-enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|Stereocontrolled 1,2-additions to {{carbonyl}} groups (especially ketones) are {{an important}} class of reactions because they provide access to substituted alcohols, generating a new stereocenter in the process. Especially widespread are various reagents for stereocontrolled 1,2-hydride additions (or reductions) of ketones. A well-known method to synthesize enantiopure alcohols by ketone reduction is the Midland Alpine borane reduction, named after its inventor Professor M. Mark Midland. The strategy uses a chiral organoborane, derived from the hydroboration of alpha-pinene by 9-BBN, to differentiate <b>enantiotopic</b> faces of a ketone. Following workup with basic hydrogen peroxide, the product alcohols can be obtained, often with high degrees of enantioselectivity. The reaction works best {{if one of the}} ketone groups has low steric hindrance, such as an alkyne or nitrile. Another method, first developed in the 1980s, is called the CBS (Corey-Bakshi-Shibata) reduction, and it features the use of an oxazaborolidine catalyst along with borane as a reducing agent for accomplishing enantioselective ketone reductions. The CBS reduction has been used extensively by chemists en route to synthesizing a wide variety of natural products, including alkaloids, terpenoids, pheromones, and biotins. Fig. 1 shows an example of a diastereoselective CBS reduction being used to prepare a complex macrocyclic alcohol en route to the synthesis of 11-desmethyllaulimalide (an analog of the antitumor agent laulimalide). The authors noted that CBS reduction was much more effective than using either lithium tert-butoxyaluminum hydride or L-Selectride. The CBS catalyst, usually prepared from diphenylprolinol, often can be used in low catalyst loadings, even as low as 2%.|$|E
40|$|The {{splitting}} {{of signals}} in the NMR spectra originating from <b>enantiotopic</b> sites in prochiral molecules when dissolved in chiral solvents {{is referred to}} as spectral <b>enantiotopic</b> discrimination. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) due to the combined effect of the anisotropic magnetic interactions and the ordering of the solute in the mesophase. The enantiorecognition mechanisms are different for rigid and flexible solutes. For the former, discrimination results from symmetry breaking and is restricted to solutes whose point groups belong to one of the following four (“allowed”) symmetries, Cs, C 2 v, D 2 d and S 4. The nature of the symmetry breaking for each one of these groups is discussed and experimental examples, using mainly 2 H 1 D/ 2 D-NMR in chiral polypeptide lyotropic mesophases, are presented and analyzed. When flexible optically active solutes undergo fast racemization (on the NMR timescale) their spectrum corresponds to that of an average prochiral molecule and may exhibit <b>enantiotopic</b> sites. In CLCs, such sites will become discriminated, irrespective of their average (improper) symmetry. This enantiodiscrimination results mainly from the different ordering of the interchanging enantiomers. Several examples of such flexible molecules, including solutes with average axial and planar symmetries, are commented. Dynamic processes in solution that are not accompanied by the modulation of magnetic interactions remain “NMR blind”. This is sometimes the case for interconversion of enantiomers (racemization) or exchange of <b>enantiotopic</b> sites in isotropic solvents. The limitation can be lifted by using CLCs. In such solvents, non-equivalence between enantiomers or between <b>enantiotopic</b> sites is induced by the chiral environment, thus providing the necessary interactions to be modulated by the dynamic processes. Illustrative examples involving exchange of both, <b>enantiotopic</b> sites and enantiomers are examined. In this comprehensive review, various important aspects of enantiodiscrimination by NMR are presented. Thus the possibility to reveal <b>enantiotopic</b> recognition using residual dipolar couplings or to determine the absolute configuration of <b>enantiotopic</b> NMR signals is discussed. The various kinds of chiral mesophases able to reveal <b>enantiotopic</b> discrimination in guest prochiral molecules are also described and compared with each other. Finally to illustrate the high analytical potentialities of NMR in CLCs, several and various applications involving the enantiodiscrimination phenomenon are described. A strategy for assigning the NMR signals of meso compound in a meso–threo mixture of cyclic molecules is first discussed.

40|$|We {{describe}} the enantiomeric and <b>enantiotopic</b> {{analysis of the}} NMR spectra of compounds derived from the functionalized cone-shaped core, cyclotriveratrylenes (CTV), dissolved in weakly oriented lyotropic chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) based on organic solutions of poly-γ-benzyl-l-glutamate. The CTV core lacks prostereogenic as well as stereogenic tetrahedral centers. However, depending on the pattern of substitution, chiral and achiral compounds with different symmetries can be obtained. Thus, symmetrically nonasubstituted CTVs (C 3 symmetry) are optically active and exhibit enantiomeric isomers, while symmetrically hexasubstituted (C 3 v symmetry) derivatives are prochiral and possess <b>enantiotopic</b> elements. In the first part we use 2 H and 13 C NMR to study two nonasubstituted (−OH or −OCH 3) CTVs, where the ring methylenes are fully deuterated, and show {{for the first time}} that the observation of enantiomeric discrimination of chiral molecules with a 3 -fold symmetry axis is possible in a CLC. It is argued that this discrimination reflects different orientational ordering of the M and P isomers, rather than specific chiral short-range solvent−solute interactions that may affect differently the magnetic parameters of the enantiomers or even their geometry. In the second part we present similar measurements on hexasubstituted CTV with flexible side groups (−OC(O) CH 3 and the, partially deuterated bidentate, −OCH 2 CH 2 O−), having on the average C 3 v symmetry. No spectral discrimination of <b>enantiotopic</b> sites was detected for the −OC(O) CH 3 derivative. This is consistent with a recent theoretical work (J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 111, 6890) that indicates that in C 3 v molecules no chiral discrimination between <b>enantiotopic</b> elements, based on ordering, is possible. In contrast, a clear splitting was observed in the 2 H spectra of the <b>enantiotopic</b> deuterons of the side groups in the tri(dioxyethylene) −CTV. It is argued that this discrimination reflects different ordering characteristics of the various, rapidly (on the NMR time scale) interconverting conformers of this compound. Assuming two twisted structures for each of the dioxyethylene side groups, four different conformers are expected, comprising two sets of enantiomeric pairs with, respectively, C 3 and C 1 symmetries. Differential ordering and/or fractional population imbalance of these enantiomeric pairs leads to the observed spectral discrimination of sites in the side chains that on average form <b>enantiotopic</b> pairs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enantiotopic</b> {{discrimination}} in the NMR spectra of prochiral rigid solutes in chiral liquid crystals (CLC), by the ordering mechanism, is limited to molecules possessing one of the four, so called, "allowed" symmetries, D 2 d, C 2 v, Cs, and S 4. So far, such spectral discrimination was demonstrated only for solutes possessing {{one of the first}} three symmetries. In this work, we present deuterium NMR measurements on a rigid S 4 compound dissolved in a chiral nematic solvent and demonstrate, for the first time, <b>enantiotopic</b> {{discrimination in}} such symmetry. The measurements were performed on the isotopically normal icosane derivative (1) and on its isotopomer (1 −d 8), specifically deuterated in its four core methylene groups. As a CLC solvent, a lyotropic mesophase, consisting of a solution of poly−γ−benzyl−L−glutamate (PBLG) in pyridine, was employed. For comparison with a corresponding achiral liquid crystal (ALC) solvent, a solution of a racemic mixture of poly−γ−benzylglutamate (PBG) of similar composition in the same co−solvent was used. The spectra were recorded at 92. 1 MHz using the 2 D Q−COSY Fz sequence with proton decoupling. In the CLC solvents they exhibited clear discrimination due to different <b>enantiotopic</b> sites, with components displaced symmetrically, at frequencies below and above those in the corresponding ALC, as expected for discrimination by ordering. Two procedures were employed for correlating the <b>enantiotopic</b> sites in the CLC spectra. For 1 −d 8 the dipolar cross−peaks in a 2 D 2 H− 2 H COSY− 90 experiment provided identification of signals belonging to the same methylene (and hence the same <b>enantiotopic)</b> groups. For 1 the correlation was achieved using a least−square−deviation fitting of the experimental quadrupole splittings with respect to those expected from the molecular geometry. These results, with appropriate symmetry considerations were used to determine the symmetric (Szz) and antisymmetric (Sxy and Sxx−Syy) components of the Saupe ordering matrix. Interpretation of the NMR spectra of prochiral solutes in CLC suffers from the ambiguity in identifying the signals with specific <b>enantiotopic</b> groups. For this reason only the relative (but not the absolute) signs of the antisymmetric elements of the ordering matrix can be determined. For the S 4 group this leads to sign ambiguity in the rhombic term in the diagonalized ordering matrix. Similar (but not identical) ambiguities occur for solutes belonging to the other allowed groups. In a concluding section of the paper, the ambiguities in the antisymmetric order parameters for the various allowed groups are compared and their physical meaning are discusse...|$|E
