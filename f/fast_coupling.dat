40|$|AbstractFast {{inhibitory}} synaptic transmission in {{the central}} nervous system is mediated by ionotropic GABA or glycine receptors. Auditory outer hair cells present a unique inhibitory synapse that uses a Ca 2 +-permeable excitatory acetylcholine receptor to activate a hyperpolarizing potassium current mediated by small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. It is shown here that unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents at this synapse are mediated by SK 2 channels and occur rapidly, with rise and decay time constants of ∼ 6 ms and ∼ 30 ms, respectively. This time course is determined by the Ca 2 + gating of SK channels rather than by the changes in intracellular Ca 2 +.

Despite the fact that delivery of an electrical current to the hyperexcitable epileptic brain might, at first, seem contradictory, neurostimulation has become an established therapeutic option with a promising efficacy and adverse effects profile. In responsive neurostimulation the strategy is to interfere as early as possible with the accumulation of seizure activity to prematurely abort or even prevent an upcoming seizure. The design of technology required for responsive stimulation is more challenging compared with devices for open-loop neurostimulation.

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} and the rhinal cortex, two substructures of {{the medial}} temporal lobe, together {{play a crucial}} role in human declarative memory formation. To investigate in detail the mechanism connecting these two structures transiently during memory formation we recorded depth EEG in epilepsy patients from within the hippocampus and the rhinal cortex. During this recording, patients performed a single-trial word list-learning paradigm with a free recall memory test following a distraction task. Rhinal-hippocampal EEG coherence and spectral power at both locations in the time interval up to 2 s after onset of word presentation were analysed in the frequency range 1 - 19 Hz. Successful as opposed to unsuccessful memory formation was associated with a general rhinal-hippocampal coherence enhancement, but without alterations in spectral power. Coherence increases in the theta range were correlated with the previously reported memory-related changes in rhinal-hippocampal gamma phase synchronization. This correlation may suggest an interaction of the two mechanisms during declarative memory formation. While theta coherence might be associated with slowly modulated coupling related to an encoding state, rhinal-hippocampal gamma synchronization may be more closely related to actual memory processes by enabling <b>fast</b> <b>coupling</b> and decoupling of the two structures...|$|E

40|$|This report {{studies the}} effect of the local spatial density of {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) immobilized within a low-solids content, large-particle diameter cellulose support. A novel epoxide-gradient activation method (epoxy-GAM) for creating a gradient of support activation was compared to classical bulk activation/bulk coupling (BA/BC) methods using different coupling chemistries. In addition to using epoxy-GAM, a two-step coupling (TSC) sequence comprised of mAb permeation under slow coupling conditions followed by conditions having <b>fast</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction kinetics was used to further assist in the goal of distributing the mAb within the matrix. Immunosorbents containing volume-averaged mAb densities of 1 – 12 mg/ml of support were studied. A gradient of immobilized fluorescein label and fluorescein-labeled mAb was observed by fluorescent imaging within 10 µm thick cross-sections of the epoxy-GAM supports. The antigen-binding efficiency (ηeff) of an immunosorbent is defined in this study as the experimentally observed binding capacity of an antigen (mg antigen (Ag) /ml support) divided by the maximum theoretical antigen-binding capacity based upon a 2 : 1, Ag: mAb stoichiometric ratio and is expressed as a percentage. The ηeff of immunosorbents obtained using epoxy-GAM/TSC contained a more uniform spatial distribution of immobilized mAb and were significantly more active (ηeff = 30 – 50 %) relative to those immunosorbents made using epoxy-BA/BC methods that contained locally high mAb densities that were immobilized only near the bead edge (ηeff = 1 – 10 %).

40|$|We {{compared}} particle {{data from}} a moored video camera system with sediment trap derived fluxes at ~ 1100 m depth in the highly dynamic coastal upwelling system off Cape Blanc, Mauritania. Between spring 2008 and winter 2010 the trap collected settling particles in 9 -day intervals, while the camera recorded in-situ particle abundance and size-distribution every third day. Particle fluxes were highly variable (40 - 1200 mg m**- 2 d**- 1) and followed distinct seasonal patterns with peaks during spring, summer and fall. The particle flux patterns from the sediment traps correlated to the total particle volume captured by the video camera, which ranged from 1 to 22 mm** 3 l**- 1. The measured increase in total particle volume during periods of high mass flux appeared to be better related to increases in the particle concentrations, rather than to increased average particle size. We observed events that had similar particle fluxes, but showed clear differences in particle abundance and size-distribution, and vice versa. Such observations can only be explained by shifts {{in the composition of}} the settling material, with changes both in particle density and chemical composition. For example, the input of wind-blown dust from the Sahara during September 2009 {{led to the formation of}} high numbers of comparably small particles in the water column. This suggests that, besides seasonal changes, the composition of marine particles in one region underlies episodical changes.

40|$|A {{combination}} of computer modeling and experimental approaches {{were taken to}} study tactile sensory processing in the cerebellar cortex. First, a detailed computer simulation of the cerebellar cortex was built. This model included the physiological properties of the different cells involved and their synaptic distributions. The model was used to study how a single tactile stimulus, arriving in the granule cell layer, is translated into Purkinje cell activity, {{the output of the}} cerebellar cortex. The model was also used to study the lack of beam-like Purkinje cell activation after a focal stimulation of the granule cell layer in opposition to the most accepted theory of cerebellar cortical function: The beam hypothesis. The model predicts that the <b>fast</b> <b>coupling</b> between the axons of granule cells with a small number of inhibitory cells generates a compensatory driving force on the Purkinje cell's dendritic tree that cancels the beam activation. The main prediction of the model is that when supressing the inhibitory influence on Purkinje cells a beam would be observed. Second, simultaneous recordings of Purkinje cells sharing the same granule cell input were collected while the receptive field of one of them was stimulated. The cortex was bathed with bicuculline to block inhibitory input to Purkinje cells and the stimulation repeated. In the control case, only one of the Purkinje cells responded to the stimulus; the others showed inhibition or did not respond at all. After bicuculline application, beams of Purkinje cell activity were observed, thus confirming our simulation predictions. Third, using a detailed Purkinje cell model the effects of different levels of granule cell and molecular interneuron input on the output of this cell were explored. The results suggest that the granule cell input is divided in two functional synaptic systems. The first one drives the Purkinje cell to fire and comes from the ascending segment part of the granule cell axon. The second one, combined with molecular interneuron activity, modulates the response of the Purkinje cell to ascending segment input. Based on the computational and experimental results of this work, we propose that parallel fibers and molecular interneurons have a modulatory effect on the response of the Purkinje cell to the more direct and strong ascending segment input...|$|E
40|$|Global warming {{together}} with the extensive agriculture favours the uncontrolled growth of cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae. Being {{one of the oldest}} life forms on our planet, they have reached evolutionary perfection over time. They are distributed at a variety of habitats, primarily in water. Cyanobacterial blooms present immediate danger to animals and humans, as cyanobacteria are known to produce various toxic compounds. This thesis addresses some of the open questions regarding cyanobacterial toxins. The current project involves the isolation, characterization, derivatization and biological and toxicological evaluation of various toxic compounds derived from cyanobacteria. Our attempts for labelling cyanobacterial toxins {{led to the development of}} an optimized protocol for arginine derivatization in complex peptides. This straightforward procedure allows modifying the arginine moiety in peptides containing with other functional groups, such as fluorophores or biotin under mild conditions in an operatively simple procedure. This method was applied for labelling leuprolide, a clinical drug, for in vivo studies in Daphnia. Microcystins are one of the most common and widely distributed cyanobacterial toxins. Their hepatotoxicity in humans makes them an important compound class. Microcystin-LR is the most toxic and common representative of the microcystin family (LD 50 = 50 µgkg- 1), yet the precise mechanism of its action is still under debate. To gain an insight into the uptake, distribution, accumulation and excretion of MC-LR, biological studies are necessary. One way to investigate the molecular mechanism of interaction of microcystin-LR is fluorescence labelling. An efficient synthesis route for the modification of the toxin’s arginine-residue was established, which allowed the preparation of microcystin derivatives with a variety of markers attached (fluorescent tags, biotin, diazirine). These derivatives preserved the parent toxicity as judged by phosphatase inhibition assays, cell viability assays, and acute toxicity assays against Thamnocephalus platyurus. Structure elucidation of a newly isolated toxic peptide,aeruginosin 828 A, from Planktothrix strains was conducted. 2 D-NMR studies and MS-characterization of the toxin revealed the presence of phenyllactic acid (Pla), chloroleucine (Cleu), 2 -carboxy- 6 -(4 ’-sulfo-xylosyl) -octahydroindole (Choi), and 3 -aminoethyl- 1 -N- amidino-delta 3 -pyrroline (Aeap) residues. This peptide showed inhibitory activity against thrombin and trypsin. Furthermore, for the first time within this compound class, toxicity against Thamnocephalus platyurus was observed. This toxic peptide could only be found in microcystin-deficient Planktothrix strains. Another group of toxins, produced along with the microcystins via the nonribosomal pathway, are the cyanopeptolins. A member of this group, cyanopeptolin 1020, is a potent inhibitor of trypsin, human kallikrein and factor Xia. Unlike the microcystins, cyanopeptolins and cyanopeptolin 1020 in particular have not been investigated in detail so far. One way to get a better understanding of the toxicity of this compound class are biological test with fluorescently-labelled cyanopeptolins. A method for labelling the glutamate residue in cyanopeptolin 1020 was established. The protocol allows <b>fast</b> <b>coupling</b> on the carboxylic function of the toxin.

50|$|The cams {{at the end}} of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal up against a gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut all the way around the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, <b>faster</b> <b>coupling</b> operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the cams on the end of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|R
