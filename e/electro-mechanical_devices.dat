50|$|Various {{technologies}} {{can be used}} {{to avoid}} overvoltage, but it must be done so efficiently so that energy savings resulting from using the correct voltage are not offset by energy wasted within the device used to do so.

50|$|Although OKW/Chi were {{ahead in}} the use of {{mechanical}} aids before the war, these were mostly <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices,</b> and little use was found for newer valve or electronic based devices. In fact the use of electro mechanical cryptanalytic devices fell during the war. Although some work was done to prototype working models, in general it was mostly experimental work. Experiments did show one thing, that paper tape was far too slow, and that the future was photo-electric scanning of text.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "kinechromatic" [...] {{was coined}} in 1951 by Mario Pedrosa {{in an article}} in Tribuna da Imprensa to refer to the work of Brazilian artist, Abraham Palatnik. Palatnik {{initially}} created <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices,</b> based on the kaleidoscopic principle, which projected a constantly changing pattern of coloured light on a screen. Later devices exposed coloured moving parts of the machinery. In all cases, the shape and colour observed were changed by the devices for a stationary observer. Frank Popper, the eminent art historian, among others, commented on Palatnik's [...] "luminous mobiles" [...] and their aesthetic of motion.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{computing}} means building interactive physical {{systems by}} the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world. While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices</b> such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware.|$|E

50|$|An {{electrical}} connector, is an <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device</b> used to join electrical terminations {{and create}} an electrical circuit. Electrical connectors consist of plugs (male-ended) and jacks (female-ended). The connection may be temporary, as for portable equipment, require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two wires or devices. An adapter {{can be used to}} effectively bring together dissimilar connectors.|$|R
25|$|The bombe was an <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device</b> that {{replicated}} {{the action}} of several Enigma machines wired together. A standard German Enigma employed, at any one time, a set of three rotors, each {{of which could be}} set in any of 26 positions. The standard British bombe contained 36 Enigma equivalents, each with three drums wired to produce the same scrambling effect as the Enigma rotors. A bombe could run two or three jobs simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|A refreshable {{braille display}} or braille {{terminal}} is an <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device</b> for displaying braille characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface. Blind computer users who cannot use a computer monitor {{can use it to}} read text output. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the same task, and a blind user may switch between the two systems or use {{both at the same time}} depending on circumstances. Deafblind computer users may also use {{refreshable braille display}}s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{electronic computer}} games actually implemented were two custom built machines called Bertie the Brain and Nimrod, which played tic-tac-toe {{and the game}} of Nim, respectively. Bertie the Brain, designed and built by Josef Kates at Rogers Majestic, was displayed at the Canadian National Exhibition in 1950, while Nimrod, conceived by John Bennett at Ferranti and built by Raymond Stuart-Williams, was displayed at the Festival of Britain and the Berlin Industrial Show in 1951. [...] Neither game incorporated a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. Before these, automated games like the simple chess simulator El Ajedrecista (1914) and Nimrod's predecessor Nimatron (1940) had been created as <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
50|$|McGowan {{was born}} in Ashley, Pennsylvania, the third of five children. After {{graduation}} from high school he joined the US Army {{and served as a}} medic {{for two and a half}} years. After an honorary discharge from the military he attended King's College, Pennsylvania and received a degree in chemical engineering. He then attended Harvard Business School, graduating in 1954. After graduation from Harvard, McGowan began operating a consulting firm that specialized in rescuing troubled companies in the garment district of New York City. After a year of operation, his consulting agency branched out into venture capital. In the role of venture capitalist, McGowan dealt with firms developing ultrasonic cleaning technology and <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{calibrating}} sights, {{there was}} no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the cross level of the gun and used feedback from <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>devices,</b> such as gyroscopes and electronic clinometers, aligned to the axis of the bore. These devices were subsequently replaced by ring laser gyros.|$|E
50|$|The SeaChanger Color Engine is an <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device</b> {{that is used}} {{to control}} light color in entertainment-industry {{lighting}} applications. The unit employs four overlapped color filter wheels, inserted into a light beam near its source, to produce colored light. This is in contrast to color scrollers, which insert color filter ribbons into a light beam. The color engine, which was released by Ocean Thin Films in 2005, is designed to fit into the Source Four lighting instrument made by Electronic Theatre Controls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} chimes {{were played}} by hand by the announcers, {{which led to}} occasional errors and undesirable variations. In 1932 a standardized [...] "chimeless chime", which promised to play the notes consistently — one reviewer commented that [...] "there {{will be no more}} sour notes from those NBC chimes — was developed by Richard H. Ranger, a former RCA engineer who had invented an electronic organ. Ranger's creation was a music box-style <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device,</b> which played the three-note sequence at the push of a button.|$|R
50|$|A {{stick pusher}} is a device {{installed}} in some fixed-wing aircraft {{to prevent the}} aircraft from entering an aerodynamic stall. Some large fixed-wing aircraft display poor post-stall handling characteristics or are vulnerable to deep stall. To prevent such an aircraft approaching the stall the aircraft designer may install a hydraulic or <b>electro-mechanical</b> <b>device</b> that pushes forward on the elevator control system whenever the aircraft’s angle of attack reaches the pre-determined value, and then ceases to push when the angle of attack falls sufficiently. A system for this purpose {{is known as a}} stick pusher.|$|R
