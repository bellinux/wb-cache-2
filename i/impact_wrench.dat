5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrench</b> - An {{air powered}} socket wrench that {{delivers}} high torque output by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft. Nearly every auto body or mechanic shop {{will have an}} air compressor and <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> to loosen and tighten lug nuts on wheels. [...] Most major tool manufacturers carry an air <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> including DeWalt, Ingersoll, and Craftsman.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are {{available}} in every standard socket wrench drive size, from small ¼" [...] drive tools for small assembly and disassembly, up to 3½" [...] and larger square drives for major construction. <b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are one of the}} most commonly used air tools.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{torque wrench}} is significantly quieter, lighter weight and {{more accurate than}} pneumatic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> capable of similar torque output, making it an appealing alternative for many users to the very loud and cumbersome <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> or torque multipliers which were formerly the only viable option for working with very large nuts and bolts until the hydraulic torque wrench was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common power source for <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> {{providing}} a low-cost design with the best power-to-weight ratio. A simple vane motor is almost always used, usually with four to seven vanes, and various lubrication systems, the most common of which uses oiled air, while others may include special oil passages routed to the parts that need it and a separate, sealed oil system for the hammer assembly. Most <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> drive the hammer directly from the motor, giving it fast action when the fastener requires only low torque. Other designs use a gear reduction system before the hammer mechanism, most often a single-stage planetary gearset usually with a heavier hammer, delivering a more constant speed and higher [...] "spin" [...] torque. Electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> are available, either mains powered, or for automotive use, 12-volt, 18-volt or 24-volt DC-powered. Recently, cordless electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> have become common, although typically their power outputs are significantly lower than corded electric or air-powered equivalents. Some industrial tools are hydraulically powered, using high-speed hydraulic motors, and are used in some heavy equipment repair shops, large construction sites, and other areas where a suitable hydraulic supply is available. Hydraulic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> have the advantage of high power-to-weight ratio.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or electric <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> or impact driver {{to deliver the}} amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{variety of}} <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> in all common sizes from ¼" [...] to 1", of {{different}} styles, including inline, butterfly, and pistol grip.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> presenting a safety risk.|$|R
50|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> pulse tools, nutrunners, screwdrivers, drills, grinders, die grinders, sanders, {{dental drills}} and other {{pneumatic}} tools {{use a variety}} of air motors. These include vane type motors, turbines and piston motors.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of power}} wrench is {{designed}} more for speed and less for torque. If {{high levels of}} torque are desired an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> should be used.|$|E
50|$|Lug nuts may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. Lug nuts {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn lug nuts.|$|E
5000|$|Pneumatic {{torque wrench}} - Operates like the torque {{multiplier}} but is mated to a pneumatic air motor. It {{is essentially a}} mix of the compressed air powered <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> and the traditionally hand operated torque multiplier, delivering aspects of both tools.|$|E
50|$|A {{power wrench}} is type of wrench that {{is powered by}} other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> and air ratchet wrenches or pneumatic ratchet wrenches.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: The Need for <b>Impact</b> Socket <b>Wrenches</b> in Global Industry ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|R
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} {{torque wrench}} is sometimes confused {{with a standard}} <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> due to their similar appearance. A pneumatic torque wrench is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the Hammers of an impacting wrench. A pneumatic torque wrench has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy.|$|E
50|$|An <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> (also {{known as}} an impactor, impact gun, air wrench, air gun, rattle gun, torque gun, windy gun) is a socket wrench power tool {{designed}} to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench.</b> Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket <b>wrenches</b> include pneumatic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the changes over a workshift in fingertip tactile perception thresholds in users of <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> exposed to intermittent hand transmitted vibration. A further {{aim was to}} assess the relation between acute changes in tactile sensation, sensorineural disorders, and vibration dose. METHODS: The study populations consisted of 30 workers exposed to vibration (16 men and 14 women) and 25 control manual workers (10 men and 15 women). Sensorineural disorders in the fingers and hands were graded according to the staging system of the Stockholm workshop scale. Tactile function was tested by measuring aesthesiometric thresholds (two point discrimination and depth sense perception) and vibrotactile perception thresholds at 16, 31. 5, and 125 Hz before and after a workshift. Temporary threshold shift was then calculated as the difference between threshold measures before and after the shift. The measurement and assessment of exposure to vibration were made according to the international standard ISO 5349. The vibration dose accumulated over a workshift (m 2 s- 4 h) was estimated for each user of <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Daily exposure to vibration was also expressed in terms of eight hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration ((ahw) eq(8) in ms- 2 rms). RESULTS: After adjustment for age and alcohol consumption, vibrotactile perception thresholds before exposure were greater in the workers exposed to vibration than in the controls. No differences in aesthesiometric thresholds before the shift were found between the study groups. Sensorineural disorders were mild in the workers exposed to vibration and minor neurological abnormalities were detected at the physical examination. Owing to the intermittent use of <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> the estimated mean (ahw) eq(8) for the subjects exposed to vibration was low (1. 3 ms- 2 rms). A significant temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at all test frequencies was found in the workers exposed to vibration but not in the controls. A significant increase in depth sense perception thresholds was found in the men exposed to vibration. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at 125 Hz, {{and to a lesser extent}} at 16 and 31. 5 Hz, was associated with the severity of sensorineural disorders. In the workers exposed to vibration the temporary threshold shift in vibration sense at all test frequencies was positively related to the estimated dose of vibration received over a workshift. No significant relation was found between aesthesiometric threshold changes and vibration dose. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent exposure to hand transmitted vibration over a workshift can cause a deterioration of tactile perception in the fingers of users of <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Acute tactile dysfunction was related to both the estimated dose of vibration and the severity of sensorineural symptoms. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception suggested that fast adapting skin mechanoreceptors such as Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles were mainly involved in the acute sensory impairment to the fingertips of the workers exposed to vibration. Changes in tactile perception can occur in workers with daily exposure to vibration that is considered to be associated with a minimal risk of adverse health effects induced by vibration...|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} {{torque wrench}} is sometimes confused {{with a standard}} <b>impact</b> <b>wrench,</b> because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric torque wrench is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. This is why an electric torque wrench has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy.The electric torque wrench was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic.|$|E
50|$|The hammer {{mechanism}} in an <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> needs {{to allow the}} hammer to spin freely, impact the anvil, then release and spin freely again. Many designs are used to accomplish this task, all with some drawbacks. Depending on the design, the hammer may drive the anvil either once or twice per revolution (where a revolution {{is the difference between}} the hammer and the anvil), with some designs delivering faster, weaker blows twice per revolution, or slower, more powerful ones only once per revolution.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the CP611 <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> {{was used}} in the steel {{erection}} phase of the World Trade Centers (New York City). Sold for several years into industrial markets, CP torque impact wrenches were introduced in the 1970s into the automotive market. In 1987, Chicago Pneumatic became part of the Swedish conglomerate Atlas Copco. During 1988, more new products were launched {{than at any time since}} the late '70s, such as screwdrivers, assembly tools and new ratchet wrenches. The following year, the current logo was designed and adopted.|$|E
50|$|Many users {{choose to}} equip their air-powered <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{with a short}} length of air hose rather than {{attaching}} an air fitting directly to the tool. Such a hose greatly aids in fitting the wrench into tight areas, by not having the complete coupler assembly sticking {{out the back of}} the tool, as well as making it easier for the user to position the tool. An additional benefit is greatly reduced wear on the coupler, by isolating it from the vibration of the tool. A short length of hose also prevents the air fitting from being broken off in the base of the tool if the user loses their grip and the tool is allowed to spin.|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a wheel with a lug wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make the nuts very difficult to remove. Also, uneven torque between the various lug nuts, or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the brake rotor if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> should properly be used only for removing lug nuts, not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|R
5000|$|A {{widespread}} {{application of}} pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, <b>impact</b> <b>wrenches,</b> pulse tools, screwdrivers, nut runners, drills, grinders, sanders and so on. Pneumatic motors {{are also used}} stationary {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power [...] and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.|$|R

The fourth tire changer, whose {{responsibility}} is the rear tire {{on the far side of}} pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the feed hose for the <b>impact</b> <b>wrench</b> used to change the tires, and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses.|$|E
50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an <b>Impact</b> <b>wrench</b> or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are widely}} used in many industries, such as {{automotive}} repair, heavy equipment maintenance, product assembly, major construction projects, and any other instance where a high torque output is needed. For product assembly, a pulse tool is commonly used, as it features a reactionless tightening while reducing the noise levels the regular impacts suffer from. Pulse tools use oil as a medium to transfer the kinetic energy from the hammer into the anvil. This gives a smoother impulse, a slightly lower torque to weight ratio and a possibility to design a shut off mechanism that shuts the tool down when achieving the correct torque. Pulse tools are not referred to as [...] "impact wrenches" [...] as the performance and technology are not the same.|$|R
