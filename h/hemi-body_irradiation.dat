40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of two consecutive nonrandomised treatment programs applied between 1989 and 1999 at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan in an unselected cohort of 59 children over the age of one with stage 4 neuroblastoma. Both treatment programs consisted of two phases, the induction of the remission phase and the consolidation phase. The induction of the remission phase consisted of intensive chemotherapy, and remained the same throughout the study period. The consolidation phase consisted of sequential <b>hemi-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> (HBI) (10 [*]Gy per session, 6 weeks apart) in the first period (1988 –June 1994) and sequential high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone+L-PAM and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in the second (July 1994 – 1999). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significantly better outcome for patients treated with the second program, the 5 -year event-free survival probability being 0. 12 for program 1 and 0. 31 for program 2 (P= 0. 03). This finding led us to conclude that sequential HBI is useless as consolidation treatment. The high-dose chemotherapy adopted in the second program enabled a proportion of patients to obtain long-term survival but, since the clinical results remain unsatisfactory, new treatment strategies are warranted...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in 30 patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in first complete remission (CR 1) following remission induction chemotherapy. Two patients relapsed prior to ABMT. All patients were conditioned with high-dose melphalan. In Addition, ten received fractionated total body irradiation, one <b>hemi-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> and four high-dose etoposide. Unmanipulated non-cryopreserved autologous marrow was reinfused within 56 h of harvesting. Engraftment occurred in all patients with a median of 11 days of neutropenia (< 0. 5 x 10 (9) l- 1), a median requirement for platelet transfusion of 3 days and packed red cell transfusion of 2 units, with a median hospital stay of 18 days post transplant. There was no procedure-related mortality and only minor morbidity was observed. Two patients relapsed at 1 and 2 months post transplantation, and one patient died of carcinoma of the lung 33 months after transplantation. The remaining 25 patients remain alive, well and in CR 1 with a median follow-up of 44 months. The event-free survival at 3 years for all patients considered for ABMT was 83 %. We conclude that ABMT for high-grade NHL in CR 1 with non-cryopreserved marrow results in rapid haematological recovery without growth factor support. It is safe and is associated with high survival when used as consolidation of CR in high-risk patients...|$|E
40|$|There is {{clinical}} {{interest in}} the modulation of regulatory T cells for cancer therapy. The safety of these therapies in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapies, including radiation therapy, can be studied in animal models. The effects of partial depletion of regulatory T (Treg) cells with an anti-CD 25 antibody in conjunction with ionizing radiation on inflammation and tissue injury were analyzed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. An anti-CD 25 antibody (PC 61) was administered 3 days prior to 13 Gy lower-half <b>hemi-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> (HBI). The blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) were harvested at various times thereafter. Alterations {{in the proportion of}} leukocyte subsets including CD 4 (+) T cells, CD 8 (+) T cells, Treg cells, B cells, NK cells, NK 1. 1 (+) T cells, macrophages and granulocytes were analyzed by FACS. The lungs, liver, pancreas, stomach, jejunum, duodenum, ileum, colon and kidney were harvested and studied by H&E staining. Expression of inflammatory mediators in plasma and tissue were investigated by ELISA. HBI significantly decreased the leukocyte pool though the various leukocyte subsets had different sensitivities to HBI. The administration of PC 61 significantly decreased the proportion of Treg cells in spleen, iLN, mLN and blood (reduction of approximately 60 %). Irradiation significantly increased the proportion of Treg cells in the spleen, iLN and mLN. HBI induced a systemic inflammatory reaction as demonstrated by increased plasma levels of IL- 6, KC/CXCL 1 and circulating granulocytes in the blood. Neutrophils also infiltrated the small bowel. The same general patterns were observed whether or not Treg cells were partially depleted with PC 61 prior to HBI. These data demonstrate that partial depletion of Treg cells in these mice does not influence HBI-induced inflammatory response and tissue injury, and that combining anti-CD 25 therapy with radiation may be safe and well tolerated in a clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: The primary {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} non-randomized {{study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>hemi-body</b> <b>irradiation</b> (HBI) on pain {{and quality of life}} in cancer patients with extensive bone metastases. The secondary aim was to evaluate side-effects and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Materials and Methods: Between March 2008 and December 2010, a total of 23 (male = 14, female = 9, median age = 60 years) diagnosed cases of metastatic cancer patients (prostate = 11, breast = 6, and lung = 6) received HBI, which was delivered as lower (n = 7) (dose = 8 Gy), upper (n = 8) (dose = 6 Gy), or sequential HBI (n = 8) with a Telecobalt unit (Theratron 780 C). Among them, one lung cancer patient died at 2 months and one prostate cancer patient defaulted after the second follow-up. Thus, 21 patients (male = 13, female = 8, median age = 65 years) (prostatic cancer = 10, breast cancer = 6, and lung cancer = 5) were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Evaluations were performed before and at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. Pain evaluation was done by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Percentage of Pain Relief (PRR), and Global Pain Score (GPS). Toxicity was assessed by CTC v- 3 toxicity scores in the medical record. Assessment of oral morphine consumption was done before and after radiation using paired t-test, and correlation analysis was also done with decrease of morphine consumption and reduction of pain score using statistical analysis. Results: Response (control of pain) was partial (PR) in 67 % and complete (CR) in 22 % of patients. For most patients, the pain control lasted throughout the follow-up period (6 months). From 66. 66 % patients requiring 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day prior to HBI, none of the patients required to consume 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day following HBI, which was correlated with significant reduction in various pain scores (P < 0. 05). One way ANOVA with Dunnett′s Multiple Comparison Test (P < 0. 05) was significant in VAS score changes, VRS score changes, PPR score changes, and GPS score changes. Along with the decrease in morphine tablets, the Linear Correlation of various scales for pain reduction like VAS, VRS, PPR, and GPS were significant. As such, the quality of life was better due to decreased pain and also, a decrease in the dose of analgesics. Grade 1 and 2 hematological toxicity and grade 1 diarrhea were observed as common side-effects. The average total cost of treatment including hospital stay, medicines, and radiation charges was around INR 400. 00. Conclusion: This study shows that hemibody irradiation is not only an effective modality for palliation of severe bone pain in advanced cancer cases but also economical, involves short hospital stay, with acceptable side-effects, utilizes the simple Telecobalt machine, and is less cumbersome in comparison to other currently available pain palliation methods like oral morphine and radiopharmaceuticals...|$|E
