40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine {{electronic}} business developments in manufacturing SMEs in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The lack of studies into the field of e-business and manufacturing SMEs stimulated this piece of research which aims to bridge the knowledge gap that exists in current academic research and literature. The recent economic history of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland shows that whilst the manufacturing industry has {{played an important role}} in economic development over the years, it is now facing the same problems as many of the advanced western economies. Consequently the industrial structure of the marketplace is no longer sufficient, particularly for manufacturing SMEs, who have been impacted by enormous changes in their business processes (Raymond and Bergeron, 2008). Difficulties are apparent within the traditional (sunset) manufacturing industries and in part, technological changes have fuelled their continued decline. At the same time, new technology-based, knowledge intensive manufacturing sector (sunrise) firms have emerged. However due to a dearth of research, the diffusion and assimilation of e- business in various manufacturing sectors represents a key area of investigation (Raymond, 2005; Raymond and St. Pierre, 2007). Theoretically this study has been informed by two contrasting schools of thought namely technological determinism and social constructivism, which philosophically underpin both the diffusion and adoption of a technological innovation, in this case e-business developments. Technological determinism provides a broad view of technology diffusion where technology is viewed as the principal root of societal transformation and is a totally independent process beyond all human control (McLuchan, 1970). Social constructivism proffers the alternative view that the development of a technology is a dependent process, involving actors and social groups who engage in strategies to win from the opposition and to shape technology according to their own plan (Brey, 1997) The research employs a sequential mixed methods (survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews) approach. The rationale for this approach is that the quantitative phase provides an exploratory and broad understanding of the research problem, while the qualitative phase refines and explains those statistical results by exploring participants' views in more depth (Creswell, 2003; Rossman and Wilson, 1985; Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). The objectives of the study are to: assess the level of adoption and usage of e-business in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; to determine the drivers that influence e-business adoption and the benefits derived from e-business developments; to examine the barriers that influence e-business developments; and to understand the factors that impact upon e-business usage and development in Ireland. The main conclusions drawn from the findings are that within the Irish manufacturing sector, SMEs are adopting and developing e-business at varying degrees. However in the majority of cases e-business adoption is erratic and e-business development remains 11 elementary. It is also the case that the full benefits of e-business are not being realised in the majority of firms. Competitive rivalry is dictating the manufacturing firms' strategic approach to e-business adoption and development and ironically one of the most significant barriers recognised by firms to e-enablement is lack of government support. Contrary to the technologically <b>deterministic</b> <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> which suggests that e- business is adopted sequentially over time, the findings in this study indicate that within manufacturing SMEs the adoption process is a haphazard affair and takes a diverse, contingent and social route, which concurs with the philosophy of social constructivism. In light of the current study it is evident that a firm's environmental, strategic, managerial, operational and technological context are deemed to influence a manufacturing SME's assimilation of electronic business activities. Several practical recommendations are made to assist manufacturing SMEs in developing their use of JCTs. The research also adds to the knowledge base by making several theoretical contributions that serve to confirm, extend and disconfirm previous knowledge in the wider areas of e-business, manufacturing and SME literature. Future research in this area could be extended to other regions and other sectors. It could perhaps attempt to bridge the theory-practice gap by conducting a three strand study involving government, practitioners and academics. Longitudinal and multiple case studies research approaches could also expand on the current study. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
50|$|In general, {{there are}} two {{different}} <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> on CVC research. One <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is Creole Exceptionalism, which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language. Another <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> however is referred to as Crioulidade, which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents <b>of</b> this <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the Exceptionalism <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> suggests.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to limited}} {{information}} in site investigation, {{it is not}} possible to obtain the actual values for the mean, standard deviation, and scale of fluctuation of a soil property of interest. The deviation between the estimated values and actual values is called the statistical uncertainty. There are two <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> on how to model the statistical uncertainty: frequentist thought and Bayesian <b>thought.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to discuss their philosophical difference, to show how to quantify the statistical uncertainty based on these two distinct <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> and to compare their performances. For the frequentist <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> the confidence interval will be used to quantify the statistical uncertainty, whereas the posterior probability distribution will be used for the Bayesian <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Examples will be presented to compare the performances <b>of</b> these two <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> in terms <b>of</b> their consistencies. The results show that in general the Bayesian <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> performs better in terms of consistency.

40|$|<b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> {{analysis}} {{is an important}} yet not-well-elaborated scientific knowledge discovery task. This paper makes the first attempt at this problem. We focus on {{one aspect of the}} problem: do characteristic school-of-thought words exist and whether they are characterizable? To answer these questions, we propose a probabilistic generative School-Of-Thought (SOT) model to simulate the scientific authoring process based on several assumptions. SOT defines a <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> as a distribution of topics and assumes that authors determine the <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> for each sentence before choosing words to deliver scientific ideas. SOT distinguishes between two types of school-of-thought words for either the general background <b>of</b> a <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> or the original ideas each paper contributes to its <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Narrative and quantitative experiments show positive and promising results to the questions raised abov...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} how far the notion <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is compatible with methodological pluralism. Should economics instead be categorised simply as pluralist or non-pluralist? The notion of structured pluralism is developed, where categories, connections and (crucially) absence of connection apply at a variety <b>of</b> levels. <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> provide some <b>of</b> that (provisional, mutable) structure, encapsulating, among other things, the use of language within each community. Awareness, and understanding, of the different categories and meanings <b>of</b> different <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is necessary for successful communication, and thus for the benefits of pluralism. pluralism, boundaries, <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought,...</b>|$|R

In the periods of minor occultation and early periods of major occultation, so many different opinions emerged {{on the concept of}} Imȃmate. These differences gave rise to the creation of many sects among the Shi‛ites and lead also to apostasy and conversion of a great group of the Shi‛ites into other beliefs. Studying the Shi‛ite <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> including those <b>of</b> the Kūfa, Qum and Baghdȃd, this paper is an attempt to study their disputes on the concept of Imȃmate and some publications of the Shi‛ite scholars including `Shaykh Mūfid, 2 ̆ 7 `Shaykh Ṣaduḳ, 2 ̆ 7 `Muhammad Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Farrukh al-Ṣaffȃr al-Qummi, 2 ̆ 7 and `Kulayni 2 ̆ 7 and their effective roles in determining the concept <b>of</b> Imȃmate.

The reliability coefficient for the first factor was [...]. 95, while that of the second factor was [...]. 90. Various literature sources indicated two main <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> as to what values for alpha are acceptable. The first <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is that values for alpha ranging between [...]. 70 and [...]. 95 are acceptable (e.g., Bland and Altman 1997; George and Mallery 2005). The second <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> holds that values for alpha between [...]. 70 and [...]. 90 are acceptable (e.g., Streiner 2003; Tavakol and Dennick 2011). While acknowledging the differing views regarding acceptable values of alpha, the current study adopted the second <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> This is because researchers within this <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> made a strong case as to why the acceptable values of alpha should not exceed [...]. 90, maintaining that an alpha value greater than [...]. 90 may suggest redundancy.|$|R
