In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.|$|E

25|$|From the gene's {{point of}} view, {{evolutionary}} success ultimately depends on {{leaving behind the}} maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave {{the maximum number of}} viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours would be changed to red and white, but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927.

While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their primary colour in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.|$|E
25|$|Much about Canadian {{federalism}} has undoubtedly {{changed in}} the last fifteen years, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> much remains the same. The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A protracted political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the British North America Act of 1867. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.|$|E
