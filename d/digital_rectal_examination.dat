25|$|There {{are also}} several other tests {{that can be}} used to gather more {{information}} about the prostate and the urinary tract. <b>Digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination</b> (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Cystoscopy shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the urethra. Transrectal ultrasonography creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.|$|E

50|$|During a <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DRE), {{a doctor}} will wear a {{lubricated}} latex glove and gently insert one finger, or digit, into the patient’s anus {{to perform a}} physical examination of the lower pelvic regions. This test is traditionally used for men to check the prostate gland for any abnormal bumps or growths, and for women to check the uterus and ovaries. This test can help identify complications that may be causing abnormal bowel habits, which can help properly diagnose cases of dyssynergia.|$|R
50|$|Anal {{sphincter}} dyssynergia {{tends to}} be one of the most predicted diagnoses with a patient suffering from symptoms like chronic constipation and inability to control bowel movements. Diagnosis techniques for dyssynergia have been known to be expensive and aren’t commonly offered at some countrywide hospitals. Fortunately, there are still special tests and examinations that can be done given the proper medical care and treatment to properly detect and diagnose dyssynergia. Those following treatments include: anorectal manometry (balloon expulsion test and anal sphincter EMG), defecography studies, and <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DRE).|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination,</b> to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. <b>Digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination</b> is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

Prior to DW-MRI, all patients had negative <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations,</b> negative or equivocal conventional cross-sectional imaging, and negative bone scans.

40|$|Context: Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{frequently}} diagnosed at advanced stages in Nigeria. Aims: To determine the screen detected PCa prevalence {{in a suburban}} community and explore any relationships between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and anthropometric measurements. Settings and Design: Nsukka is a town and local government area (LGA) in Southeast Nigeria in Enugu State. Towns that share a common border with Nsukka are Edem Ani, Alor-uno, Opi, Orba, and Ede-Oballa. Nsukka LGA has an area of 1810 km 2 and a population of 309, 633 at the 2006 census. All consecutive responders who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Subjects and Methods: A screening outreach was conducted in one location in Nsukka. PSA testing and <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> were performed. Height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Statistical Analysis Used: Results were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 20 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20. 0. Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical {{data were analyzed using}} the Chi-square test, with significance level set at P< 0. 05. Pearson's correlation was conducted for interval data (P < 0. 05). Results: One-hundred and sixty men met the inclusion criteria and were screened. Age range was 40 – 81 years; PSA range was 1. 20 – 33. 9 ng/ml. <b>Digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DREs) was abnormal in 17 men. Median BMI was 27. 49. A Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a significant correlation between age and PSA, r = 0. 127; P ≤ 0. 05, and DRE findings and PSA, r = 0. 178; P ≤ 0. 05. There was no significant correlation between height and PSA, r = − 0. 99; P = 0. 211; weight and PSA, r = − 0. 81 P = 0. 308; and BMI and PSA, r = − 0. 066; P = 0. 407. 8 / 21 men consented to prostate biopsy with three positive, giving a screen detected PCa prevalence of 1. 875 %.

40|$|Purpose: We updated a {{long-term}} cancer control outcome {{in a large}} anatomical radical retro-pubic prostatectomy (RRP) series. We also evaluated the perioperative parameters that predict cancer specific outcomes following surgery. Materials and Methods: From May 1983 to February 2003, 1 surgeon (WJC) performed RRP in 3, 478 consecutive men. Patients were followed with semiannual serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests and annual <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations.</b> We used Kaplan-Meier product limit esti-mates to calculate actuarial 10 -year probabilities of biochemical progression-free survival, cancer specific survival and overall survival.

40|$|Two {{recently}} reported large-scale trials {{conducted in the}} United States and western Europe have provided evidence that coordinated screening programs will not reduce mortality in countries or regions where prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is already highly prevalent, but will reduce mortality in places where PSA testing prevalence is low.

The instigation of a national screening program should be delayed until a more specific marker for aggressive disease than PSA level becomes available. In the meantime, results of the two trials {{can be used to}} inform the development of regional testing policies in Australia. These policies should encourage regular PSA testing in regions with low testing prevalence, but must also embrace methods of dealing with over-diagnosis and over-treatment.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{practices and}} recommendations {{of primary care}} physicians with regard to cancer screening of elderly patients (65 years and older) were studied in a 1987 survey of 400 Maryland physicians. More than 90 percent of physicians in four specialties studied reported providing <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations,</b> physical breast examinations, and mammography to the elderly. However, only 54 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists and 68 percent of general practitioners provided sigmoidoscopy, 70 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists provided stool guaiac slide tests, 74 percent of general practitioners provided breast self-exam instruction, and 79 percent of internists provided Pap tests. Physicians were asked what screening intervals they recommended for each test for asymptomatic elderly patients. These reports were compared with current American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations. Large proportions of physicians in four specialties recommended sigmoidoscopy and mammography less often than the ACS recommended. More than 20 percent of physicians in the four specialties believed the elderly do not need routine sigmoidoscopy.

5000|$|Most urologists {{will monitor}} a patient on {{surveillance}} with PSA and <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination</b> at least biannually, and perform surveillance prostate biopsies at 1-2 year intervals. [...] However, defining disease progression is problematic. Progression in active surveillance programs {{has been defined}} based on PSA kinetics or exceeding a given PSA threshold, increased extent of cancer or higher grade disease on prostate biopsy, change in <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination,</b> and proceeding to curative intervention. Yet, PSA changes and exceeding a given threshold PSA value may not reflect progression of disease. [...] A change in stage or <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examination</b> findings is unusual among patients with low risk disease. Switching from surveillance to curative intervention may be triggered by a patient’s personal preference or anxiety and not necessarily by {{a change in the}} cancer. Cancer grade is the strongest feature associated with long term freedom from disease in untreated men, and therefore the finding of high grade cancer (Gleason score above 6) is the most universally agreed upon trigger for intervention for men on surveillance. However, it appears that most men who are found to have high grade disease on surveillance biopsies, had the high grade disease missed on the diagnostic biopsy and not progression from low to high grade cancer while on surveillance. This misclassification of disease at diagnosis may be reduced in the future with improvements in imaging and biopsy tissue assessment that go beyond the Gleason score.|$|E

A retrospective analysis of all men presenting for screening at the Jamaica Cancer Society from 1995 to 2005 was done. All patients had <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests done. Results of prostate biopsies were noted. 1117 men of mean age 59. 9 ± 8. 2 years presented for screening. The median documented PSA was 1. 6 [*]ng/mL (maximum of 5170 [*]ng/mL). Most patients presented for only 1 screen. There was a gradual reduction in the mean age of presentation for screening over the period. Prostate biopsies were requested on 11 % of screening visits; however, only 59 % of these were done. 5. 6 % of all persons screened were found to have cancer. Of the cancers diagnosed, Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma was the commonest grade and median PSA was 8. 9 [*]ng/mL (range 1. 5 – 1059 [*]ng/mL). Older men tend to screen for prostate cancer in Jamaica.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess knowledge, beliefs, and {{practices}} of primary care clinicians regarding colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: We surveyed 77 primary care providers in six clinics in central Massachusetts to evaluate several factors related to colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Most agreed with guidelines for fecal occult blood test (97 %) and sigmoidoscopy (87 %), which were reported commonly as usual practice. Although the majority (86 %) recommended colonoscopy as a colorectal cancer screening test, it was infrequently reported as usual practice. Also, 36 % considered barium enema a colorectal cancer screening option, and it was rarely reported as usual practice. Despite lack of evidence supporting effectiveness, <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> and in-office fecal occult blood test were commonly reported as usual practice. However, these were usually reported in combination with a guideline-endorsed testing option. Although only 10 % reported that fecal occult blood test/home was frequently refused, 60 % reported sigmoidoscopy was. Frequently cited patient barriers to sigmoidoscopy compliance included fear the procedure would hurt and that patients assume symptoms occur if there is a problem. Perceptions of health systems barriers to sigmoidoscopy were less strong. CONCLUSIONS: Most providers recommended guideline-endorsed colorectal cancer screening. However, patient refusal for sigmoidoscopy was common.

40|$|Introduction: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of acute urinary retention on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Materials and Methods: Men aged 50 years and older who presented with acute urinary retention were studied. Patients with urethral stricture, neurogenic bladder, prostate cancer, and those {{with a history of}} recent instrumentation or prostate biopsy were excluded. Blood samples for serum PSA measurement were obtained (PSA 1), and an indwelling urethral catheter was inserted for 2 weeks. Before catheter removal, a second blood sample for measurement of serum PSA level (PSA 2) was obtained. In patients who were able to void, a third sample was obtained 3 weeks later (PSA 3). In the first and second visits, <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DRE 1, DRE 2) were performed to assess prostate volume. Mean PSA levels (PSA 1, PSA 2, and PSA 3) and prostate volumes (DRE 1, DRE 2) were compared.

40|$|Men's {{participation}} in cancer screening {{may be influenced}} by their thinking style. Men's need for cognition (NFC) and faith in intuition were measured to explore whether they varied by demographic variables or predicted screening behavior. Australian males (n = 585, aged 50 - 74 years) completed surveys about past screening and were subsequently offered mailed fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs). Demographic predictors included age, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and language spoken at home. The screening behaviors were self-reported prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen testing and <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> [DREs]), and colorectal cancer screening (self-reported FOBT participation and recorded uptake of the FOBT offer). Analysis comprised principal component analysis and structural equation modelling. NFC was positively related to demographic variables education, socioeconomic status, and speaking English at home. Faith in intuition was negatively related to educational attainment. NFC predicted variance in self-reported DRE participation (r =. 11, p =. 016). No other relationships with thinking style were statistically significant. The relationship of NFC to DRE participation may reflect the way certain attributes of this screening method are processed, or alternatively, it may reflect willingness to report participation.

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in men. Traditional {{screening}} and diagnostic methods include <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> (DREs), biopsies and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, with the latter being the more popular. PSA is a biomarker for prostate cancer; however, it is highly sensitive to external factors as well as other prostate diseases. As such, the reliability of of the serum PSA level as a sole screening and diagnostic tool for prostate cancer is controversial. Recently, it has been shown that fasting extremes can affect concentrations of serum chemistry analytes, thus raising the question of whether or not fasting has an effect on the highly sensitive PSA biomarker. Patients testing for serum PSA levels are often concomitantly submitting to other tests that require fasting, subjecting certain patients to a fasting PSA level while others not. The objective of this study was to investigate whether this discrepancy in fasting state translates into an effect on serum PSA levels. Serum PSA levels and fasting time records for 157 276 men who underwent testing at Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS; Calgary, Alberta, Canada) between 01 January 2010 and 31 March 2013 were accessed. Linear regression models of mean PSA levels and fasting times revealed a statistically important relationship at certain fasting times. Applying a dynamic mathematical model to explore the clinical effect of fasting suggests minimal impact on serum PSA result interpretation. Thus, patients can be tested for serum PSA levels regardless of their fasting state...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{will discuss}} {{current and future}} anal {{cytology}} screening programs to detect anal dysplasia in HIV-positive {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), in addition to other interventions aimed at early detection of anal cancer in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence of progression from high-grade anal dysplasia to anal cancer has been recently demonstrated and strengthens the clinical imperative to diagnose and treat this lesion in at-risk populations. The use of adjunct molecular techniques that improve specificity of anal cytology screening may have the potential to rationalize current screening referral pathways and focus resources on those at highest risk of progressing to cancer. Candidate biomarkers that are currently being investigated include protein surrogates of cell cycle deregulation (such as p 16 ink 4 a and minichromosomal maintenance proteins), DNA damage biomarkers (53 BP 1) in addition to testing for human papillomavirus genotype, gamma tubulin and beta defensin levels. SUMMARY: Anal cytology, although sensitive for the detection of any anal dysplastic abnormality, has poor specificity to detect high-grade anal dysplasia. As new molecular techniques are evolving, the most important immediate clinical intervention is to educate HIV-positive MSM in order to increase awareness of both risk and clinical symptoms suggestive of progression to anal cancer. In the absence of high-resolution anoscopic expertise, it is recommended that regular <b>digital</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>examinations</b> are performed as most early cancers are palpable even in the absence of clinical symptoms. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
