5|$|Shoshone National Forest was {{the setting}} of the 2016 first person {{adventure}} video game, <b>Firewatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Firewatch</b> is a first-person mystery {{adventure}} game {{developed by}} Campo Santo {{and published by}} Campo Santo and Panic. The game was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4, and for Xbox One in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Firewatch</b> is {{the first}} video game from Campo Santo, and was created by Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, who were the {{creative}} leads on The Walking Dead; Nels Anderson, the lead designer of Mark of the Ninja; and artist Olly Moss. Chris Remo was involved in {{many aspects of the}} design, and also composed the score.|$|E
50|$|On 8 March 1945, a Keevils {{employee}} named Mears {{had been}} taking his turn <b>firewatching,</b> and was killed when a V-2 rocket struck Smithfield causing 110 deaths. This was only 2 weeks {{before the end of}} the V-2 strikes.|$|R
50|$|Orwell {{states that}} the essay was {{triggered}} by the experience of an editor friend who was <b>firewatching</b> during the Second World War. He was told by factory workers {{that they had no}} interest in literature because they could not afford books.|$|R
2500|$|The {{picture was}} taken on 29/30 December 1940, the 114th night of the Blitz. The Daily Mails chief {{photographer}} Herbert Mason was <b>firewatching</b> {{on top of the}} roof of his newspaper's building, Northcliffe House, in Tudor Street, off Fleet Street. German bombs destroyed hundreds of buildings that night and thick black smoke filled the air. Mason wanted to get a clear shot of St Paul's and waited hours for the smoke to clear sufficiently.|$|R
5|$|<b>Firewatch</b> {{runs on the}} Unity game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Users of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift {{virtual reality}} {{headsets}} can tour Henry's lookout tower using the Steam application Destinations. For this purpose, {{the scene was}} rebuilt on the Source game engine. <b>Firewatch</b> was made compatible with PlayStation 4 Pro on its November 10 launch, with enhanced performance through 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range imaging. The free roam mode was enabled for PlayStation 4 Pro and Steam shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Firewatch</b> is a first-person {{adventure}} {{game that}} takes place in the American state of Wyoming in 1989. Players take on the role of Henry, a fire lookout who is assigned to his own tower in Shoshone National Forest. Through exploration of the surrounding area, Henry uncovers clues about mysterious occurrences in the vicinity that are related to the ransacking of his tower while out on a routine patrol and a shadowy figure that occasionally appears watching him from afar.|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War, women's brigades {{carried out}} {{fire-fighting}} and rescues in the South of England. During the 1920s, women firefighting teams were employed by private fire brigades. At {{the beginning of}} the Second World War, 5000 women were recruited for the Auxiliary Fire Service, rising to 7000 in what was then the National Fire Service. [...] Though trained in firefighting, they were not there for that purpose but for driving, <b>firewatching</b> etc. Many received awards for heroism.|$|R
5000|$|Green {{is famous}} for his zany and {{slightly}} eccentric behaviour. Members of the Masque Theatre in Northampton were able to recall Green's antics in minute detail many years (decades?) after his departure, and the Northampton Chronicle office was awash with Green stories, all {{on the theme of}} good intentions leading to all-round chaos. At the Leicester Mercury he was <b>firewatching</b> one night with Maurice Barsby. Maurice said when looking at the huge printing presses in the basement [...] "I know how these things work …” Michael said [...] "Go on, then". He pulled the main switches and Maurice pressed the button. The press started but not gradually, and the enormous reel of paper broke and spewed into the machine-room. So there was no midnight edition of the Mercury, and as the presses did not stop when the button was pressed they had to switch off at the mains. Next day Michael was questioned and then sacked, but not Maurice. Green admits that he [...] "had a reputation for playing the fool." [...] The overnight <b>firewatching</b> job was unpopular, except with lads of 16 or 17 who were too young to be called up; they could drink brown ale, use the typewriters and telephones and smoke the editor’s cigars (leaving burns in the carpet).|$|R
50|$|James Robertson {{was born}} in Rutherglen, Scotland {{and grew up in}} a close-knit working-class family. He became a Quaker in his late teens, and in the Second World War he {{registered}} as a conscientious objector. In 1941 James and his wife Joyce Robertson joined Anna Freud in the Hampstead Wartime Nurseries. Joyce was a student caring for the infants who had lost family life due to the war. James began by organising the maintenance and <b>firewatching,</b> but later became the social worker. Both James and Joyce benefited from teaching by Anna Freud.|$|R
5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, earning {{praise for}} its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style. However, {{the presence of}} technical issues and the game's ending were both subjects of criticism. <b>Firewatch</b> won the award for Best 3D Visual Experience at the Unity Awards 2016, Best Indie Game at the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Best Narrative at the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards and Debut Game at the 2017 British Academy Games Awards. By the end of 2016, the game had sold over a million copies. A film based on the game is being developed by Campo Santo and Good Universe.|$|E
5|$|Development for <b>Firewatch</b> {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working {{on the periphery of}} game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The {{walkie-talkie}} {{interaction in}} <b>Firewatch</b> {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptation}} {{retained the}} nameless {{status of the}} Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the American journalist Martha whilst <b>firewatching</b> {{on the roof of}} Broadcasting House during the Blitz. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30 million AD {{at the end of the}} universe before disappearing or dying there.|$|R
50|$|In Great Britain, Girton Ladies' College had an all-women's {{fire brigade}} from 1878 until 1932. In 1887 it was {{reported}} that women employed in a cigar factory in Liverpool had been formed into a fire brigade, and had effectively extinguished a fire at the factory.During the First World War, women's brigades carried out fire-fighting and rescues in the South of England. During the 1920s, women firefighting teams were employed by private fire brigades. At the beginning of the Second World War, 5000 women were recruited for the Auxiliary Fire Service, rising to 7000 in what was then the National Fire Service. Though trained in firefighting, they were not there for that purpose but for driving, <b>firewatching</b> etc. Many received awards for heroism.|$|R
5000|$|Dwelly's {{devotion to}} the cathedral was {{demonstrated}} during the Second World War, when he took up residence within the building, making a bedroom of a small, unheated room off a tower staircase. From there he supervised continuous <b>firewatching</b> during the Blitz. In 1947 he accepted an invitation from the University of Cambridge to preach a series of lectures on pastoral theology. After the war, his marriage came under strain, with his wife becoming reclusive; she died in 1950. Dwelly suffered a decline in his physical and mental health, and resigned as dean in 1955, being appointed [...] "Dean Emeritus". He died {{at his home in}} Toxteth, Liverpool, on 9 May 1957. After the funeral service in the cathedral his body was cremated; his ashes placed were placed in a memorial to him in the south choir aisle, sculpted by Carter Preston, which was unveiled in December 1960.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, the U.S. Forest Service {{acquired}} 25 retired AH-1Fs {{from the}} U.S. Army. These have been designated Bell 209 {{and are being}} converted into <b>Firewatch</b> Cobras with infrared and low light sensors and systems for real time fire monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Steins;Gate 0 {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, {{and was the}} best-reviewed PlayStation Vita game of 2016 on Metacritic. Kotaku included it {{on a list of}} the best Japan-only video games of 2015, and it was the runner-up for RPGFan Best Adventure/Visual Novel of 2016 award, behind <b>Firewatch,</b> with the publication saying that it rivals the first Steins;Gate. It was also the runner-up for their Reader's Choice award in the same category, behind Zero Time Dilemma by six votes. Critics called it a worthy follow-up to Steins;Gate, but thought that players should experience the original game or its anime adaptation beforehand.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of three unnamed captains, the Ghenters laid siege to Oudenaarde on 14 April 1453, also occupying Espierres, attacking Aalst and later (on 16 April) unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to take Grammont. They threw two bridges over the Scheldt {{on either side of}} the city so that they could attack from both banks. De Lalaing prepared to resist the attackers by burning the suburbs of the city. The Ghenters transported a large amount of artillery by the river, described by one chronicler as including bombards, cannons, veuglaries and serpentines. Among these was the huge bombard known as Dulle Griet, which weighed more than 16 tons. The defenders also had a large number of artillery pieces and the resulting artillery duel over the course of the siege was one of the largest seen in Europe until that point. The defenders organised <b>firewatch</b> parties to counter incendiary projectiles launched into the city at night and tanks of water in the street to put out fires.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 Lt Col George Babington Croft Lyons left a {{substantial}} bequest to the Society of Antiquaries {{to prepare a}} revised and improved edition of Papworth. Anthony Wagner became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the war years, working in inactive periods of <b>firewatching</b> duties) to assemble material on index cards. However, the task was a large one and progress slow, {{in part because of}} Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of primary sources, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid of computer technology, the first volume of what was now entitled the Dictionary of British Arms appeared in 1992. Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In British Columbia, {{which has}} the third largest film and {{television}} production sector in North America, PAs are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada. Production Assistants represented by the DGC work in the Locations Department and work {{both on and off}} set with duties including locking up the set, traffic control, echoing rolls, <b>firewatching,</b> and liaising with the public and location owners. The Key-PA is in charge of all the PAs and is the 1st ADs' right-hand man when it comes to do with the on set aspects regarding a location. From this position DGC PA's can move up through the Locations Department or the Assistant Direction (AD) Department as either a Training Locations Manager (TAL) or a Training Assistant Director (TAD), respectively. Office Production Assistants work in the production office as an Office PA and they work for the Production Manager, Production Coordinator, Assistant Production Coordinator, and / or other office staff in maintaining the work-flow in the office. From this position, Office PAs can work their way up through the office by becoming an Assistant Production Coordinator (APOC), which is unionized under IATSE 891. Pay for PAs according to the DGC Collective Agreement in BC is $205.00 (non-members) to $215.00 (members) for a 15-hour day. An 8-hour day is approximately $118.00.|$|R
5000|$|The road {{begins as}} Club Road at 2100 m {{elevation}} on the bund at Kodaikanal Lake, climbing west as Upper Shola road and forking left as Pillar Rocks road. It has very good dream Nelly the Green Valley View, (formerly called Suicide Point) at km 5.5, Kodaikanal Golf Club at km 6, Pillar Rocks Viewpoint at km 6.5and Moir Point at km 9.3. At {{this point of}} 2310 m elevation the road forks, with the left fork going towards Berijam, and Munnar. The right fork is the [...] "Goschen Road" [...] to the villages of Poombarai and Kukkal northwest of this place. Extensions to Mannavanur (junction), and Kavunji, together with a connecting road to Berijam Lake from near Kavunji, create a loop of about 40 mi length, the [...] "Forty Mile Round". In 1929, Sir Thomas Moir [...] "turned the first sod", beginning construction of the [...] "Goschen Road" [...] which was completed in 1932.Just past this junction is a Forest Department checkpost, which controls entry into the Allinagaram Reserve forest through which the road passes west to Berijam Lake and beyond. This area {{is part of the}} proposed Palani Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park.Beyond km marker 13 on the Berijam road there is a <b>firewatching</b> tower from where one may have a fine view of the secluded Berijam Lake and the surrounding forest.At km 21 at 2180 m elevation, Berijam has a Forest Department Camp including an Eco-Education Center for visitors. Nature areas to be visited here include: swamp ecosystem, fresh water ecosystem, nature trail, bridge, medicinal demonstration garden, museum, nature walk, grassland and shola. This camp also is the site of an old two-story brick building, partly damaged and blackened over the years, with a bright yellow painted name reading [...] "Britisher's Transit Camp". This is one of several transit camps built during World War II for British soldiers to rest along the 230 km British “Escape Route” from Kodaikanal via Top Station and Munnar to Cochin. While most of the transit camps are now either dilapidated or demolished, the one at Berijam is still used as a Forest Rest house. At this point an old road, now just a trail, forks off to the north for 12 km down to Kavunji village at 1975 m elevation. West of Berijam Lake, the road is closed for public vehicles and not maintained. Though the road is heavily damaged and overgrown till the Kerala border, it is well maintained within Kerala past Top Station.|$|R
500|$|<b>Firewatch</b> {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} review aggregator Metacritic.

500|$|In September 2017, PewDiePie {{used the}} racial slur [...] "nigger" [...] while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. As a {{response}} to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to PewDiePie as [...] "worse than a closeted racist", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against PewDiePie's videos featuring the studio's game <b>Firewatch,</b> and encouraged other game developers to do the same. PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it. I'm disappointed in myself because it seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies, [...] was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended, hurt or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position that I am, I should know better." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Hansen at Destructoid {{welcomed the}} choice-based dialog tree gameplay, {{going on to}} praise the dialog itself, {{as well as the}} voice performances. The game's most {{impressive}} achievement, as stated by Hansen, was the [...] "thematic cohesion", which was said to revolve around self-imposed isolation. The sound design was lauded to have evoked a Hitchcockian sense of fear. Reviewing <b>Firewatch,</b> Game Informer's Jeff Cork wrote, [...] "I was immediately drawn into the game's world, partly because of the power of its simple text intro, and also because of the novelty of taking part in something so mundane". Cork observed that its interactive dialog, though simple, [...] "breathes life into the game" [...] and called the conversations [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "engaging". He enjoyed exploring the forest environment, yet felt the ending was unsatisfactory in light of the story's achievements.|$|E
500|$|Scott Butterworth of GameSpot {{thought that}} the analog {{navigation}} tools – a hand-held compass and paper map – were [...] "immersive" [...] but [...] "occasionally frustrating". He found that the visual beauty of the setting allowed for a more rewarding form of exploration and noted that the sound design complemented the depth of its atmosphere. Judging {{the development of the}} characters through dialog to be [...] "bold" [...] and [...] "admirable", he opined that it served as [...] "a patient, reflective examination of how two people grow to trust and care for each other". According to Butterworth, the voice acting was brilliant and layered with emotional nuance, as he had evolved a strong attachment to the characters. GamesRadar's Justin Towell described <b>Firewatch</b> as [...] "one of the most enthralling slices of entertainment I've ever experienced". He commended the voice acting for having successfully defined each character's personality traits. Towell added that the music, alongside the sound design, worked well in service of the atmosphere. However, he disparaged a few noticeable continuity problems that left him disillusioned. Ryan McCaffrey at IGN hailed the sense of realism elicited by the setting, despite the stylized level design and artwork. He also approved of the script, saying that voice acting enhanced it further. Of the writing, McCaffrey said, [...] "It's tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that". He deemed the ending polarizing because of the story's promising escalation. Polygon's Colin Campbell appreciated the use of humor and empathy to develop the characters, considered the game's mystery to be successful and the story to be [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "satisfying". He criticized the conclusion, regarding it as unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Magness Adventure Camp is the Denver Area Council's Cub Scouting camp. [...] The camp {{has three}} shelters, {{each with a}} {{campsite}} housing eighty tents. [...] The program includes lake activities, a BB Gun range, an archery range, recently added a slingshot paint ball range and a <b>firewatch</b> tower that overlooks Elbert County. [...] The camp is also available for rental by outside groups, and is often frequented by groups such as Denver's High School ROTC and girls groups from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.|$|E
2500|$|Exploration {{games or}} {{exploration}} narrative games are narrative games that generally eschew {{any type of}} gameplay outside of movement and environmental interaction that allow players to experience their story through exploration and discovery. They are story-focused and feature fewer puzzles or even no puzzles at all. They allow players to roam around a garden-like environment freely and often tell their story through discovering elements like books, journals, or clues rather than through dialog and cutscenes as in more traditional adventure games. As win/lose conditions are de-emphasized, story and atmosphere are placed at the forefront. These may also be called walking simulators, although some people consider the latter a pejorative term. [...] Some examples of exploration games include Gone Home, Dear Esther, <b>Firewatch,</b> The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk, and Thirty Flights of Loving.|$|E
2500|$|DMCA {{claims have}} also been {{threatened}} or used to remove Let's Plays of games owned by a company who {{do not agree with}} ideals or morales of the person creating the video. In September 2017, Kjellberg accidentally blurted out a racist insult while live-streaming a game to viewers, later apologizing for this; this followed previous incidents of where Kjellberg's on-screen behavior had been criticized. Campo Santo's founder Sean Vanaman was dismayed by this, and issued a DMCA notice to takedown Kjellberg's Let's Play of their game <b>Firewatch,</b> stating that having their game shown on his YouTube channel was the equivalent of endorsing his ideologies; YouTube complied with this request a few days later. Vanaman later clarified that his goal was not to censor Kjellberg, but that there is a [...] "bad fit" [...] between Kjellberg's views and Campo Santo's views and would prefer that Kjellberg not cover his games. Lawyers and legal experts speaking to both Kotaku, The Verge and PC Gamer believed that content owners like Campo Santo have full control to issue DMCA takedowns under the law, but whether these takedowns are valid under fair use defense within copyright law is unclear, since to this point there has been no case law to challenge the legality of Let's Plays and other video game video walkthroughs or challenges to DMCA takedowns for this type of content. Kjellberg did not plan to counter the DMCA claim but pointed out that the use of DMCA to take down videos due to issues other than related to copyright has a potential for abuse by game developers and publishers and affect the current balance of the value of Let's Plays in game promotion and marketing.|$|E
50|$|On February 3, 2016, in an {{interview}} with Red Bull, Vanaman stated that, although they are in no rush at all, Campo Santo's next game will not be a sequel to <b>Firewatch.</b> On September 26, both Campo Santo and Good Universe issued a partnership to produce a feature film adaptation of <b>Firewatch</b> and other content. In November, the company stated that the game would begin a limited-run physical release towards the end of 2016. <b>Firewatch</b> sold over one million copies, overall.|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, Moss and Mark of the Ninja lead {{designer}} Nels Anderson {{joined with}} former Telltale Games employees Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman to found Campo Santo.8 Moss worked closely {{on the design}} and was art director for the studio’s first release, <b>Firewatch.</b> Inspired by the iconic style of the 1960s National Park posters, <b>Firewatch</b> echoes Moss’s graphic style.
