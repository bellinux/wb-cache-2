5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E

500|$|John Metcalf for The Spectator {{thought the}} book [...] "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable... without [...] no {{forthcoming}} railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered {{that it was}} [...] "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish {{the other parts of}} his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing."

2500|$|In mid-1930, Blumlein met Doreen Lane, a preparatory {{school teacher}} five years his junior. After two-and-a-half years of {{courtship}} {{the two were}} married in 1933. Lane was warned by acquaintances before the wedding that, [...] "There was a joke amongst some of his friends, {{they used to call}} it 'Blumlein-itis' or 'First Class Mind'. It seems that he didn't want to <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> didn't have a first class mind." [...] Recording engineer J. B. Kaye, who was Blumlein's closest friend and best man at the wedding, thought the couple were well matched.|$|E
2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more than I do.... Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E

Norquist was quoted as saying [...] "I think some people had given him up for dead, but he was good old Karl, upbeat and enthusiastic." [...] At the meeting Rove previewed Bush's final two years in office, saying Social Security reform was likely off the table and that Iraq and the economy would be the biggest issues for 2008. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> holds him personally responsible for what happened to us in the election", said a GOP national committee member, who declined to be named talking about the inner circle.

2500|$|Clinicians {{have responded}} that they are unwilling to {{consider}} the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is [...] "far-riskier" [...] than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> offers women the option of doing nothing." [...] Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis {{is the fact that it}} is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that [...] "even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating all these women, we save a bunch of lives". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel's biggest {{influences}} in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern. Kimmel has described Letterman's work as, [...] "His show {{was just so}} weird and different, I'd {{never seen anything like}} it. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had a sense of humor like that." [...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means. I guess it doesn’t matter. It’s only an exhibition, not a competition. Thanks Dave. For whatever it’s worth, you’re my favorite." ...|$|E

2500|$|Curiosity {{about the}} victims {{led to the}} re-release of Tate's films, {{achieving}} greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate on the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from Eye of the Devil. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said she was as [...] "sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known", while Patty Duke remembered her as [...] "a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> wasn't." [...] Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a press conference, saying that many times they had written that Tate [...] "was beautiful. Maybe {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world. But did you ever write how good she was?" [...] Peter Evans later quoted the actor Laurence Harvey, who commented on Polanski immediately after the murders, [...] "This could destroy Roman. Marriage vows mean nothing to him but few men have adored a woman as much as he adored Sharon." ...|$|E

Some of these examples include: attacks on Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang’s “garlic and potato” approach to treatment, outrage at Mbeki’s statement that he never <b>knew</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had died of AIDS, and coverage of the humiliating 2006 Global AIDS Conference.|$|R

50|$|Walter Abel, {{an actor}} of {{some success in}} the first half of the twentieth century, lived in the town for some part of his {{formative}} years. His earliest and probably best-known role was as D'Artagnan in 1935 version of The Three Musketeers. Much of his reputation was built on his ability to die dramatically (such as by falling off a building) when shot on film. No one extant in the town at this time even <b>knows</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> ever met him.|$|R
60|$|She {{travelled}} up to town on {{the appointed}} day and went to her house in Norfolk Street {{to see that the}} journey had left no traces on her appearance. Mayfair seemed quite deserted, and half the windows were covered with newspapers to keep out the dust. It was very hot, and the sun beat down from a cloudless sky. The pavements were white and dazzling. Julia realised with pleasure that she was the only cool person in London, and the lassitude she saw in the passers-by added to her own self-satisfaction. The month at the seaside had given an added freshness to her perfection, and her charming gown had a breezy lightness that must be very grateful to a gentleman of forty lately returned from foreign parts. As she looked at herself in the glass, Mrs. Crowley reflected that she did not <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> had a figure half so good as hers.|$|E

60|$|In this materialistic age, this hard, practical, swift, greedy age of realism, {{it seems}} {{there is no place}} for writers of romance, no place for romance itself. For many years all the events leading up to the great war were realistic, and the war itself was horribly realistic, and the {{aftermath}} is likewise. Romance is only another name for idealism; and I contend that life without ideals is not worth living. Never {{in the history of the}} world were ideals needed so terribly as now. Walter Scott wrote romance; so did Victor Hugo; and likewise Kipling, Hawthorne, Stevenson. It was Stevenson, particularly, who wielded a bludgeon against the realists. People live for the dream in their hearts. And I have yet to <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> has not some secret dream, some hope, however dim, some storied wall to look at in the dusk, some painted window leading to the soul. How strange indeed to find that the realists have ideals and dreams! To read them one would think their lives held nothing significant. But they love, they hope, they dream, they sacrifice, they struggle on with that dream in their hearts just the same as others. We all are dreamers, if not in the heavy-lidded wasting of time, then in the meaning of life that makes us work on.|$|E
