5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b> After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

25|$|The Tornado F3 {{made its}} combat {{debut in the}} 1991 Gulf War with 18 {{aircraft}} deployed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The aircraft deployed to the region were later upgraded in a crash program with improved radar and engines, better defensive countermeasures and several adaptions to the weapons systems to improve combat performance in the Iraqi theatre; however, they still lacked modern IFF and secure communications equipment. They therefore flew patrols further back from Iraqi airspace where encounters with enemy aircraft were less likely, and did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to engage any enemy aircraft. From August 1990 to March 1991, the RAF's F3 detachment flew more than 2000 combat air patrol sorties.|$|E

Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I {{think a lot of}} our success now {{has to do with the}} fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to go into the market with educated strategy.

500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara.

[...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E

[...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this {{lightbulb}} would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality.

[...] Pearl Jam faced a {{relentless}} touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E

Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel.
