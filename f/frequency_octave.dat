40|$|ABSTRACT: Ten years ago, {{the first}} Spanish high speed line which {{traveled}} from Madrid to Sevilla {{at an average}} speed of 250 km/h was inaugurated. At this speed pantograph noise, which is of an aerodynamic nature, {{is thought to have}} rather influence in the passengers zone. However, pantograph contribution is often omitted since main noise sources are expected to come from wheels and devices placed under the floor (motors, engines, compressors, etc). According to this, special anti-noise treatments are designed for floor structures achieving high noise insulation levels. Then, not expected noise contributions from the pantograph become significant. This paper is aimed at evaluating whether is necessary to apply anti-noise measures on the roof structure or not, by using the vibro-acoustical description of all car’s elements, and the measured pantograph sound power level as the inputs of a SEA model. Firstly, two microphone arrays had been used for the measurement, one of them having optimum microphone spacing to achieve best resolution at low <b>frequency</b> <b>octave</b> bands, and the other one to get best performance at high <b>frequency</b> <b>octave</b> bands, covering a global range of frequencies between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz.

40|$|A psychophysical {{experiment}} was performed examining {{the effect of}} luminance and chromatic noise on perceived image quality. The noise was generated in a recently developed isoluminant opponent space. 5 spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>octave</b> bands centered at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 cycles-per-degree (cpd) of visual angle were generated {{for each of the}} luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow channels.

The paired comparison data were used to generate interval scales of image quality using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgments. These interval scales provide insight into the effect of noise on perceived image quality. Averaged across the scenes, the original noise-free image was determined to be of highest quality.

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project [SPR 2418; 2 ̆ 2 Study {{of the performance}} of acoustic barriers for Indiana toll roads, 2 ̆ 2] the influence of environmental factors and of advanced sound barrier concepts was investigated. The presence of temperature gradients over pavements was found to have a strong influence on sound propagation. Refraction of sound waves emitted by tire-road interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} ground also affects sound barrier performance. Modified ray tracing model suggested that prevailing winds have an influence on barrier performance at large distances. Randomized edge configurations were found not to improve barrier performance for traffic noise. Random edges simply scatter sound energy without any net noise reduction. Although the edge can be optimized for specific frequency components and locations, it appears that optimization for broadband noise control is difficult. The study also suggested that adding sound absorptive material along the barrier edge could enhance barrier performance. The present study is the continuation of the latter effort to confirm the findings related to the sound absorptive treatment on the barrier through a more rigorous study and to apply the design concept to a realistic situation. A comparison was made between barriers that incorporated sound absorptive treatments and barriers with T-shaped tops. The results confirmed that a sound absorptive treatment near the barrier edge resulted in a performance improvement over corresponding rigid barriers. A design optimization study of the most effective shape of acoustic treatments concluded that a circular shape works best. The performance of two different acoustical materials was also compared. Use of glassfiber resulted in better performance in the high frequency region, while polyolefin foam with closed cells achieved a relatively large insertion loss at low frequencies. Efforts were made to develop a numerical predictive model. The boundary element method was used to model the infinite size surrounding fluid effectively. The disadvantage of the boundary element model is the calculation load associated with the large number of elements required for high frequency analysis. A mesh optimization procedure was successfully implemented in the boundary element model to reduce the calculation time while satisfying the tolerances for analysis accuracy at each analysis <b>frequency.</b> <b>Octave</b> band averaging was also adapted to facilitate the comparison between the numerical results and experimental data. It was found that the results from the boundary element model agree relatively well with the experimental results up to 6300 Hz at selected locations. The insertion loss distribution proved the numerical model 2 ̆ 7 s capability of reproducing the rather complicated interference pattern on the receiver plane correctly at one-third octave band frequencies from 1000 Hz to 6300 Hz. Spatial-averaged insertion losses over different size receiver planes showed that the numerical model was less reliable when the averaging was done close to the ground level. Preliminary measurements for an actual, real-size barrier were performed in South Bend, Indiana, to identify a measurement location that can be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed add-on device. The add-on device was designed based on laboratory experiments and numerical studies, and was proven to be effective in a realistic highway environment. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM) was exercised for the comparison of the measurements. On-site measurements were performed to evaluate the absorptive treatment. Application of the treatment over a limited (6 m) region improved the performance of the barrier by 2 to 5 dB at the frequencies from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz...|$|E

The proposed methodology could be very useful to boost smart meter potential for demand aggregators and small customers [2].

40|$|Monitoring the {{condition}} of rolling element bearings and defect diagnosis has received considerable attention for many years {{because the majority of}} problems in rotating machines are caused by defective bearings. In order to monitor conditions and diagnose defects in a rolling element bearing, a new approach is developed, based on the characteristic defect <b>octave</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The characteristic defect frequencies make it possible to detect the presence of a defect and diagnose in what part of the bearing the defect appears. However, because the characteristic defect frequencies vary with rotational speed, it is difficult to extract feature information from data at variable rotational speeds.

40|$|Perfect, {{broadband}} and asymmetric {{sound absorption}} is theoretically, numerically and experimentally reported by using subwavelength thickness panels in a transmission problem. The panels {{are composed of}} a periodic array of varying cross-section waveguides, each of them being loaded by an array of Helmholtz resonators (HRs) with graded dimensions. The low cut-off frequency of the absorption band is fixed by the resonance frequency of the deepest HR, that reduces drastically the transmission. The preceding HR is designed with a slightly higher resonance frequency with a geometry that allows the impedance matching to the surrounding medium. Therefore, reflection vanishes and the structure is critically coupled. This results in perfect sound absorption at a single frequency. We report perfect absorption at 300 Hz for a structure whose thickness is 40 times smaller than the wavelength. Moreover, this process is repeated by adding HRs to the waveguide, each of them with a higher resonance frequency than the preceding one. Using this frequency cascade effect, we report quasi-perfect sound absorption over almost two <b>frequency</b> <b>octaves</b> ranging from 300 to 1000 Hz for a panel composed of 9 resonators with a total thickness of 11 cm, i. e., 10 times smaller than the wavelength at 300 Hz...|$|R

However, the results did {{show that in}} principle, Smt mapping {{has the potential to}} produce better pitch ranking of complex tones that possess a harmonic structure. Pitch reversals arising due to filtering out of the lower frequency partials had a negative effect on the identification scores. Smt-LF mapping filters out partials below 130 [*]Hz and above 1502 [*]Hz, while Smt-MF mapping filters out partials below 440 [*]Hz and above 5009 [*]Hz. For the range of tones tested here, Smt-LF caused no loss of lower frequency partials due to filtering. Smt-MF, on the other hand, is more likely to result in the lower partials of the lower pitched tones being affected by its band-pass filter cutoff. Smt-MF mapping was designed to be {{as close as possible to}} the characteristic tonotopic frequencies of the electrode array according to the Greenwood function [27], assuming an average cochlea length of 33 [*]mm and an insertion depth of 22 [*]mm [2]. It is not possible to map Smt-LF to characteristic tonotopical locations because the lowest input frequency of 130 [*]Hz is far too distant from the characteristic frequency of the most apical electrode (whose location should correspond to a characteristic frequency of around 400 to 600 [*]Hz) according to Greenwood. Instead, Smt-LF mapping effectively transposes frequencies from 130 to 1502 [*]Hz into a higher tonal range. This may simplify pitch ranking of tones in the lower <b>frequency</b> <b>octaves</b> (e.g., octave 3) but may cause them to be perceived as unnaturally high pitched. The results nevertheless demonstrated that Smt mapping may improve pitch ranking due to improving the frequency representation.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the birth}} of {{mode-locking}} the temporal duration of optical pulses has radically diminished. In parallel to this, bandwidths have grown so large that almost entire <b>frequency</b> <b>octaves</b> are present in today’s few-cycle pulses. This thesis investigates the character of ultra-wideband pulses in nonlinear environments. Because of the growth in optical bandwidths, traditional definitions and propagation models break down, requiring newer more accurate numerical techniques. A novel approach capturing the uni-directionality of pulses {{is presented in the}} form of Gvariables by combining the electric and magnetic field descriptions. These G-variables have the advantage of both an accurate spectral representation and a reduced computational overhead, making them significantly more efficient than existing direct Maxwell solvers. Such approaches are particularly important where large propagation distances and/or transverse dimensions are concerned. Pseudo-spectral techniques {{play a key role in}} the success of these wideband models enabling sub-cycle dynamics to be studied. One such phenomenon is Carrier Wave Shocking (CWS), where the optical carrier undergoes self-steepening in the presence of third-order nonlinearity. This process is carefully studied, focussing on the effect of dispersion and the feasibility of its physical realisation. The process is then generalised to arbitrary nonlinear order, where the quadratic form finds potential applications in High Harmonic Generation (HHG). Shock detection schemes are also developed, and agree with analytical solutions in the dispersionless regime. To fully characterise few-cycle pulses, the absolute Carrier Envelope Phase (CEP) must be known. A novel 0 − f self-referencing scheme relying on wideband interference is investigated. By applying robust frequency domain definitions a proposal is made to convert this scheme into one that determines absolute CEP.

A powerful window into cochlear function {{can be obtained}} by recording from single auditory (AN) fibers, primary afferents connecting cochlear inner hair cells to the brain. This thesis provides the first systematic analysis of fundamental response properties of the mouse AN, including rate and timing of spontaneous and sound-evoked discharge, frequency selectivity, dynamic range, and the relations between spontaneous rate and these other response properties. Three wildtype strains were compared: CBA/CaJ (because it retains normal cochlear sensitivity as it ages); and C 57 BL/ 6 and 129 /SvJ (because they are used in "knockout" generation). Two lines with targeted deletion of inner ear genes were also studied. The cochlea in mouse responds to <b>frequencies</b> <b>octaves</b> higher than in humans or most other mammals; nevertheless, most other AN characteristics were fundamentally similar to those in well-studied mammals. The only significant differences were 1) smaller dynamic ranges in all three strains; and 2) high-frequency threshold elevation and tuning degradation in C 57 BL/ 6 and 129 /SvJ, consistent with early-onset degeneration of basal-turn sensory cells in these strains. The mutant lines studied included deletion of 1) Calcitonin-Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a neurotransmitter expressed by cochlear efferent fibers, or 2) the a subunit of BK channels, a large-conductance K+ channel, expressed in hair cells and AN fibers, and implicated in cochlear tuning in lower vertebrates. (cont.) Loss of CGRP had no detectable effect on AN responses, suggesting a minimal role in cochlear processing. Loss of BK channels led to dramatic decreases in sound- evoked discharge rates and spike synchronization, without changes in frequency selectivity. The degraded spike synchronization likely arises from slowing rise-times of inner hair cell receptor potentials observed in vitro; the decreased steady-state rates likely arise from depolarization block in the AN fibers themselves. by Annette M.
