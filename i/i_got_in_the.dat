25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
500|$|During the Verizon Ladies First Tour {{which also}} {{featured}} Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] in New York City {{to an audience}} of over 20,000. Before singing, she told the audience {{that she was going to}} sing about [...] "a relationship horror story". She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was [...] "is all <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end". She shouted that she wanted to hear everybody from front to back, and continued singing, then told the audience that she wrote the song for [...] "each and every one of y'all!".|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E

60|$|All {{of which}} I {{faithfully}} and foolishly did. I worked {{on until the}} time came when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last of the night coal by six o'clock.

60|$|I walked {{at once to}} {{the door}} of Number Thirteen--the number of Mrs. Catherick's house--and knocked, without waiting to {{consider}} beforehand how I might best present myself when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> first necessity was to see Mrs. Catherick. I could then judge, from my own observation, of the safest and easiest manner of approaching the object of my visit.|$|E

I intended also to develop the third, but just as I finished the others, a half-dozen city cousins swooped down upon us and I had to put away my paraphernalia, emerge from my dark retreat and fly around to entertain them.|$|E
