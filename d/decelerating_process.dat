Then, entity model of the robot is built up with Solidworks software. The motion of the robot is planned by the position, velocity and acceleration of all the joint. The first three joints, which bear most of the payload and the own weight of the robot, are set with maximum acceleration during the accelerating/ <b>decelerating</b> <b>process.</b> According to the planned trajectory, dynamic simulation is carried out using Solidworks. The driving torques of each joint are obtained. From the dynamic analysis, we find the position yielding the maximum driving torque while the robot is moving with the maximum payload and the maximum speed.

40|$|There {{have been}} of late renewed debates {{on the role of}} inhomogeneities to explain the {{observed}} late acceleration of the universe. We have looked into the problem analytically {{with the help of the}} well known spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi(LTB) model generalised to higher dimensions. It is observed that in contrast to the claim made by Kolb et al the presence of inhomogeneities as well as extra dimensions can not reverse the signature of the deceleration parameter if the matter field obeys the energy conditions. The well known Raychaudhuri equation also points to the same result. Without solving the field equations explicitly it can, however, be shown that although the total deceleration is positive everywhere nevertheless it does not exclude the possibility of having radial acceleration, even in the pure dust universe, if the angular scale factor is decelerating fast enough and vice versa. Moreover it is found that introduction of extra dimensions can not reverse the scenario. To the contrary it actually helps the <b>decelerating</b> <b>process.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|A STIRAP-based unitary <b>decelerating</b> (accelerating) <b>process</b> {{consists}} of a train of the standard three-state STIRAP pulse sequences which may act as the basic unitary decelerating (accelerating) sequences. The present work is focused on investigating analytically and quantitatively how the momentum distribution of a momentum superposition state such as a momentum Gaussian wave-packet state of a single freely moving atom affects the STIRAP state transfer in these <b>decelerating</b> and accelerating <b>processes.</b> The complete STIRAP state transfer and the unitarity of these processes are stressed highly in the investigation. It {{has been shown that}} the momentum distribution has an important influence upon the STIRAP state-transfer efficiency. In the ideal adiabatic condition these unitary <b>decelerating</b> and accelerating <b>processes</b> for a freely moving atom are studied in detail, and it is shown that they can be used to manipulate and control in time and space the center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state of a free atom. Two general (strict and accurate) adiabatic conditions for the basic STIRAP <b>decelerating</b> and accelerating <b>processes</b> are derived analytically. With the help of the STIRAP theory and the unitary quantum dynamics it confirms theoretically that the time- and space-compressing processes of the quantum control process (quant-ph/ 0607144) can be realized almost perfectly by the STIRAP-based unitary <b>decelerating</b> and accelerating <b>processes</b> in the ideal or nearly ideal adiabatic condition. Comment: 93 pages, no figure. No change for the main ideas of the old versions published in 2007, e. g., the time evolution process is calculated in the three-state subspace rather than by using the original Schroedinger equation and unitarity is necessary to realize it.

Using this as motivation, we study the evolution of cooperation in games that describe social dilemmas, where the propensity to adopt a different strategy depends both on individual fitness {{as well as on the}} strategies of neighbors. Regardless of whether the evolutionary process is governed by pairwise or group interactions, we show that plugging into the "wisdom of groups" strongly promotes cooperative behavior. The more the wider knowledge is taken into account the more the evolution of defectors is impaired. We explain this by revealing a dynamically <b>decelerated</b> invasion <b>process,</b> by means of which interfaces separating different domains remain smooth and defectors therefore become unable to efficiently invade cooperators. This in turn invigorates spatial reciprocity and establishes decentralized decision making as very beneficial for resolving social dilemmas.

40|$|A major {{consequence}} of chronic cardiac dysfunction is chronic overload of contractile myocardium. Various aetiologies, {{in reaction to}} this, may induce compensatory mechanisms consisting of excentric (dilatation) and concentric hypertrophy. Chronic left ventricular dysfunction is caused most frequently by myocardial infarction. Left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy occurs in patients with extensive infarction. Dilatation may at first be compensatory, restoring stroke volume within 4 weeks of the infarct. However, as dilatation progresses, left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume deteriorate during exercise and at rest, and finally pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increases and patients become symptomatic 1. 5 - 3 years after the infarct. Major determinants of progressive left ventricular dilatation and deterioration of haemodynamics are a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, angiographically determined infarct size, stroke volume early (4 days) after myocardial infarction, infarct location (anterior/inferior) and the grade (TIMI) of perfusion of the infarct-associated coronary artery. Chronic loading and unloading may accelerate or <b>decelerate</b> this <b>process.</b> Efficiency and energy reserve (phosphocreatine) of the dilated ventricles is reduced.

Parallel to this finding, using histopathological methods, OA extent and severity in the simvastatin-treated group decreased compared with in the untreated group.

A total of 36 leads were tested. The power spectrum, the autocorrelation function, the phase portrait, the Poincaré section, the correlation dimension, the Lyapunov exponent and the Kolmogorov entropy all {{point to the fact}} that the normal heart is not a perfect oscillator. The cardiac activity stems from deterministic dynamics of chaotic nature characterized by correlation dimensions D 2 ranging from 3. 6 to 5. 2. Two different phase spaces are constructed for the evaluation of D 2 : the introduction of time lags and the direct use of space vectors give similar results. It is shown that the variabilities in interbeat intervals are not random but exhibit short range correlations governed by deterministic laws.

40|$|The thymus {{constitutes}} the {{primary lymphoid organ}} responsible for the generation of naïve T cells. Its stromal compartment is composed of a scaffold of different subsets of epithelial cells that provide soluble and membrane-bound molecules essential for thymocyte maturation and selection. With senescence, a steady decline in the thymic output of T cells has been observed. Numeric and qualitative changes in the stromal compartment of the thymus resulting in reduced thymopoietic capacity have been suggested to account for this physiological process. The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying thymic senescence are, however, only incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-beta signaling in thymic epithelial cells exerts a direct influence on the cell’s capacity to support thymopoiesis in the aged mouse as the physiological process of thymic senescence is mitigated in mice deficient {{for the expression of}} TGF-beta receptor type II on thymic epithelial cells. Moreover, TGF-beta signaling in these stromal cells transiently hinders the early phase of thymic reconstitution following myeloablative conditioning and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The code date and shelf life of orange juice is in part determined by {{the ability of the}} product to maintain the level of vitamin C as stated on the nutritional label. Vitamin C deteriorates in the presence of oxygen; therefore, removal of oxygen from the package will <b>decelerate</b> the <b>process</b> of oxidation thereby diminishing the loss of vitamin C and prolonging the quality of the orange juice. The refrigerated shelf life of orange juice packaged in a polyethylene-coated paperboard gable top carton generally has a limited shelf life of three weeks.

It has been our finding that at eight weeks orange juice packaged in a gable top carton with an Oxygen Scavenger (OSPTM) lining maintained 35 % more vitamin C than the standard barrier carton.

40|$|More than 15 years ago, Michael Gibbons, Helga Nowotny {{and others}} {{coined the term}} “mode 2 ”, arguing that a new mode of {{production}} of scientific knowledge had emerged. In the era of mode 1, science {{had been able to}} safeguard its autonomy and almost exclusively relied on internal mechanisms of quality and relevance assessment. Mode 2, however, means that scientific knowledge has to be socially robust, counting more and more on the participation of lay-people from different parts of society. The mode 2 thesis thus reflects a fundamental transformation of the relation of science and society. The current issue of STI-Studies contains two articles that deal with mode 2 issues, one on a theoretical basis, the other presenting findings of a comparative empirical study. Both point at some weaknesses of the mode 2 thesis, thus re-opening the debate. In his article “Mode 2, systems differentiation and the significance of politico-cultural variety”, Janus Hansen argues that the mode 2 thesis is based on an unacceptable generalization and extension of trends to the socio-structural level of society, which mostly take place at the organisational level. Hansen also calls into question the implicit assumption of a universal trend toward mode 2 and a resulting convergence of modern societies as regards the science-society relation. Therefore he calls for an in-depth analysis of cross-national varieties. Voilá! STI-Studies is very proud to present an answer to these questions in the same issue. In her paper “Nanotechnology governance”, Monika Kurath presents the results of an international comparison of deliberation-oriented and public engagement projects in the field of nanotechnology regulation. Her article can be regarded as an empirical test of the mode 2 thesis. She applies a technique of rating the social robustness of different participatory discourses, concluding that selfregulation performs better than deliberation. However, only a few of these new modes of governance can be regarded as – at least partially – socially robust. Thus Kurath pours a lot of water into the wine of mode 2 proponents. The third article also contains a test of a big theory. In their article “Technology adoption in small-scale agriculture”, Genesis T. Yengoh, Armah Frederick Ato and Mats G. E. Svensson investigate the question, why technology adoption in sub-Saharian Africa does not work according to Rogers’ general model of the diffusion of innovations. By modifying the model and identifying additional factors and drivers, they show – via computer simulation – that a refined model can explain the <b>decelerated</b> <b>process</b> of technology adoption, thus identifying loci for political intervention. (Con-) Testing theories via empirical analysis is one of the paramount tasks of scientific research. All authors of the three articles in the current issue contribute to this task and show the productive results of a stimulating combination of theoretical analysis and empirical studies.
