2500|$|Each of the {{constituent}} companies of the LMS {{had their own}} liveries for locomotives and rolling stock. The {{board of directors of}} the LMS was dominated by former Midland Railway officers, and the company adopted the [...] "crimson lake" [...] livery for coaching stock as had been used by the Midland and Glasgow & South Western Railways prior to grouping (with the North Staffordshire Railway using a very similar shade). The livery worked well, proving to be <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> and practical.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{desirable}} that the tool material be sufficiently strong, tough, and <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> at the welding temperature. Further {{it should have}} a good oxidation resistance and a low thermal conductivity to minimise heat loss and thermal damage to the machinery further up the drive train. Hot-worked tool steel such as AISI H13 has proven perfectly acceptable for welding aluminium alloys within thickness ranges of 0.5 – 50mm [...] but more advanced tool materials are necessary for more demanding applications such as highly abrasive metal matrix composites or higher melting point materials such as steel or titanium.|$|E
2500|$|Devonian age {{rocks are}} broadly {{synonymous with the}} Old Red Sandstone (commonly {{referred}} to as ‘the ORS’) though the lowermost ORS is late Silurian in age. The Anglo-Welsh Basin which stretches from the border with England westwards through the Brecon Beacons National Park into Pembrokeshire includes the larger part of this sequence. [...] It is the sandstones and mudstones of the Lower Devonian Brownstones and Senni Formations, sometimes capped by the <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> sandstones of the Plateau Beds which form such striking peaks as Pen y Fan and Sugar Loaf and the dramatic scarps of the Black Mountains and Black Mountain. There are restricted occurrences of Devonian rocks on Anglesey too.|$|E
2500|$|Brussels carpet have {{a smooth}} {{slightly}} ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic {{feature of the}} carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27inch(3/4) [...] looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to 5 frames all with different colours thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial [...] and very skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could [...] be increased to about twenty thus enabling very complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.|$|E

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|Suits {{are made}} {{in a variety of}} fabrics, but most {{commonly}} from wool. The two main yarns produce worsteds (where the fibres are combed before spinning to produce a smooth, <b>hard</b> <b>wearing</b> cloth) and woollens (where they are not, thus remaining comparatively fluffy in texture). These can be woven {{in a number of ways}} producing flannel, tweed, gabardine, and fresco among others. These fabrics all have different weights and feel, and some fabrics have an S (or Super S) number describing the fineness of the fibres measured by average fibre diameter, e.g., Super 120; however, the finer the fabric, the more delicate and thus less likely to be long-wearing it will be. Although wool has traditionally been associated with warm, bulky clothing meant for warding off cold weather, advances in making finer and finer fibre have made wool suits acceptable for warmer weather, as fabrics have accordingly become lighter and more supple. Wool fabric is denominated by the weight of a one-square yard piece; thus, the heavier wools, suitable for winter only, are 12-14 oz.; the medium, [...] "three season" [...] (i.e., excluding summer) are 10-11 oz.; and summer wools are 7-8 oz. [...] (In the days before central heating, heavier wools such as 16 oz. were used in suits; now they are used mainly in overcoats and topcoats.) Other materials are used sometimes, either alone or blended with wool, such as cashmere. [...] Silk alone or blended with wool is sometimes used. Synthetic materials, while cheaper, e.g., polyester, are very rarely recommended by experts. At most, a blend of predominantly wool may be acceptable to obtain the main benefit of synthetics, namely resistance to wrinkling, particularly in garments used for travel; however, any synthetic, blended or otherwise, will always be warmer and clammier than wool alone. [...] For hot weather, linen is also used, and in (Southern) North America cotton seersucker is worn.|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>hard,</b> <b>wearing,</b> toilsome journey, {{but it had}} {{its bright}} side; for after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper of fried bacon, bread, {{molasses}} and black coffee, the pipe-smoking, song-singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in the still solitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of recreation that seemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury.|$|E

He is very clever, I assure you, and very patient of the <b>hard,</b> <b>wearing</b> life he must have of it there; and oh! so enjoying a new book, or an afternoon to himself. When I was about eight or nine, I began with him, riding into Moorworth three times in a week; and I have gone on ever since. I am sure he has done the best he could for me; and he made the readings very pleasant by his own enjoyment. If Philip had known the difficulties that man has struggled through, and his beautiful temper, persevering in doing his best and being contented, I am sure he could never have spoken contemptuously of him.' ...|$|E
