5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also developed that afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though an EF2 tornado touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> the town of Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage to homes in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario {{as far north as}} Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, {{as well as}} their entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Historian Gérard Prunier, in a book written shortly after the incident, {{concluded}} that it was most likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iraqi Freedom {{began on}} 20 March 2003. Sixty OA-10/A-10 {{aircraft}} {{took part in}} early combat there. United States Air Forces Central Command issued Operation Iraqi Freedom: By the Numbers, a declassified report about the aerial campaign in the conflict on 30 April 2003. During that initial invasion of Iraq, A-10s had a mission capable rate of 85 percent in the war and fired 311,597 rounds of 30mm ammunition. A single A-10 was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Baghdad International Airport by Iraqi fire late in the campaign. The A-10 also flew 32 missions in which the aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets over Iraq.|$|E

5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried <b>down</b> <b>near</b> river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E
5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5000|$|Henges seem to {{have existed}} on the <b>Downs</b> <b>near</b> Worthing at Blackpatch, Church Hill, Cissbury and also at Cock Hill, midway between the neolithic mining areas of Harrow Hill and Blackpatch. [...] At Cock Hill lies a henge dating from the late neolithic period, 48 metres in diameter, roughly circular, with a single {{entrance}} to the south-east. Various round barrows have been found on the <b>Downs</b> <b>near</b> Worthing close to Blackpatch and Church Hill.|$|R

5|$|Mayer {{claimed his}} first {{victories}} over United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) four-engine bombers on 23 November 1942. Together with fellow pilot Georg-Peter Eder, Mayer developed the head-on attack {{as the most}} effective tactic against the Allied daylight heavy combat box bomber formations. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 16 April 1943 after 63 victories. On 1 July 1943, he was appointed commander of JG2. On 5 February 1944, Mayer became the first pilot on the Channel Front to reach 100 victories. He was killed in action on 2 March 1944 while leading {{an attack on a}} USAAF bomber formation; he was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Montmédy, France. Mayer was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This {{achievement}} earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.|$|E
5|$|On 22 and 23 September {{small groups}} of soldiers, {{remnants}} of the Yildirim Army Group, were attacked by aircraft on the Shibleh to Beisan road near the Jordan River. Shortly afterwards a column of several thousand Ottoman soldiers were seen marching back under a white flag along the Wady el Fara road. Meanwhile, east of the Jordan River, three German Pfalz scout aircraft {{and a number of}} D.F.W. two–seater aircraft from Deraa aerodrome were attacked by three Bristol Fighters over Um es Surab. During the aerial fight a German two–seater was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Mafrak, another aircraft was forced to land near the railway and an Ottoman outpost, while the third aircraft was chased back to Deraa. Deraa aerodrome was attacked in the early morning of 23 September, by aircraft flying from Ramle. It was attacked again that night by the Handley-Page, which ended the enemy's use of that aerodrome.|$|E

5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E
5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down some power lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E
5|$|The British {{forces in}} Kenya under General Alan Cunningham, {{including}} Rhodesian officers and NCOs in the King's African Rifles and the Nigeria and Gold Coast Regiments, {{as well as}} the South African 1st Infantry Division, advanced into Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland during late January and February 1941, starting with the occupation of the ports of Kismayo and Mogadishu. The Italians retreated to the interior. No.237 Squadron meanwhile provided air support to the 4th and 5th Indian Divisions during Lieutenant-General William Platt's offensive into Eritrea from the Sudan, attacking ground targets and engaging Italian fighters. One of the Rhodesian Hardys was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> Keren on 7 February with the loss of both airman aboard; two days later five Italian fighters attacked a group of grounded Rhodesian aircraft at Agordat in western Eritrea, and wrecked two Hardys and two Lysanders.|$|E
