30|$|Silicon single-photon {{avalanche}} diodes (Si-SPADs) are {{the most}} used devices for measuring ultra-weak optical radiant fluxes in many quantum technology fields, such as quantum optics, quantum communication, quantum computing, etc. In all these fields, the detection efficiency is the main parameter, which has to be accurately known for achieving reliable measurements. In this paper we present the improvements performed on the setup described in López et al. (J Mod Opt 62 :S 21 –S 27, 2015) for determining the detection efficiency of Si-SPAD detectors with a low measurement uncertainty. The improvement arises from the precise alignment of the Si-SPAD detector and the low deviation reached between the total calculated <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> and the individual <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> measurements (≤ 0.05 %) performed with an integrating sphere with attached Si-photodiode as standard detector.|$|E
30|$|The laser {{generation}} {{depends on}} the EDF amplification spectrum gain and on the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> at the specific wavelength. The laser wavelength which will be generated {{is defined by the}} maxima of the product of the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> and the EDF amplification. However, each MMI filter exhibits a narrow wavelength range of[*]~[*] 2  nm were the transmission maxima is approximately the same. Therefore, when the pump power is changed, the EDF amplification spectrum undergoes a profile modification that leads to a laser line generation in a slightly shifted wavelength. We attributed the larger shift of the longer wavelength to the fact of λ 2 is generated in a wavelength range in which the EDF amplification spectrum exhibits a downward slope of gain which leads to a more pronounced wavelength shift when pump power is varied.|$|E

40|$|The {{electron}} beam ion trap (EBIT) facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{is being used}} to absolutely calibrate the transmission efficiency of X-ray filters employed by diodes and spectrometers used to diagnose laser-produced plasmas. EBIT emits strong, discrete monoenergetic lines at appropriately chosen X-ray energies. X-rays are detected using the high-resolution EBIT calorimeter spectrometer (ECS), developed for LLNL at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. X-ray <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency is determined by dividing the X-ray counts detected when the filter is in the line of sight by those detected when out of the line of sight. Verification of filter thickness can be completed in only a few hours, and absolute efficiencies can be calibrated in a single day over a broad range from about 0. 1 to 15 keV. The EBIT calibration lab has been used to field diagnostics (e. g., the OZSPEC instrument) with fully calibrated X-ray filters at the OMEGA laser.

40|$|Context. Narrow-band {{interference}} filters can be tuned toward shorter wavelengths by tilting {{them from}} the perpendicular to the optical axis. This {{can be used as}} a cheap alternative to real tunable filters, such as Fabry-Pérot interferometers and Lyot filters. At the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope, such a setup is used to scan through the blue wing of the Ca II H line. Because the filter is mounted in a converging beam, the incident angle varies over the pupil, which causes a variation of the transmission over the pupil, different for each wavelength within the passband. This causes broadening of the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> profile and degradation of the image quality. Aims. We want to characterize the properties of our filter, at normal incidence as well as at different tilt angles. Knowing the broadened profile is important for the interpretation of the solar images. Compensating the images for the degrading effects will improve the resolution and remove one source of image contrast degradation. In particular, we need to solve the latter problem for images that are also compensated for blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence. Methods. We simulate the process of image formation through a tilted interference filter in order to understand the effects. We test the hypothesis that they are separable from the effects of wavefront aberrations for the purpose of image deconvolution. We measure the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> profile and the degrading PSF from calibration data. Results. We find that the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> profile differs significantly from the specifications. We demonstrate how to compensate for the image-degrading effects. Because the filter tilt effects indeed appear to be separable from wavefront aberrations in a useful way, this can be done in a final deconvolution, after standard image restoration with MFBD/Phase Diversity based methods. We illustrate the technique with real data...|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} a Doppler lidar system using the edge technique to measure atmospheric wind profiles. The edge technique requires a laser with a narrow spectral bandwidth and a high resolution optical filter. The lidar system will use a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1. 064 microns and a high resolution Fabry-Perot interferometer for the edge filter. The Doppler shift measurement is made by locating the laser {{on the edge of}} the filter's spectral response function. Due to the steep slope on the edge, large changes in the <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> will be observed for small changes in frequency. The Doppler shift can be determined from a measurement of this change in <b>filter</b> <b>transmission</b> if the filter spectral response function in the region of the measurement is well known.
