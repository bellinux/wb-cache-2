40|$|In this research, {{the role}} of NGOs was {{described}} and explained, particularly {{the role of}} Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth in the climate negotiations of Kyoto (1997) and the Hague (2000). In this analysis both qualitative and quantitative (content analysis) methods were used {{and in addition to}} this, analysis {{of the role of the}} NGOs was conducted with counterfactual analyses. By interviewing the key members of the Finnish delegation and the representatives of the NGOs, information was obtained about their attitudes, opinions and knowledge. The topic of this study is rather broad, that is why several theoretical starting points were used. In this study, a political account was combined with sociological account to understand the involvement NGOs in climate change negotiations. The theoretical framework for this research consisted of analysis and criticism of traditional international theories, risk society and global civil society theorizing. Also counterfactual analysis was used to understand the importance of NGOs in the climate conferences of Kyoto and Hague. The importance of co-operation between NGOs, states and international governmental organisations can be seen as one of the main research result of this study. The co-operation is visible in Finland, where the NGOs have been members of the official delegations during the climate conferences. In other countries co-operation is dependent on how much the national position differs from the NGO positions. With counterfactual analysis it was discovered that if NGOs were not allowed to join in the negotiations this would not necessarily have an effect on the official EU position. However, this would most likely decrease the conference reporting, media coverage and result in decrease in lobbying efforts, at least in the international level. The content analyses demonstrated what kind of <b>message</b> <b>ECO</b> newsletter was sending to the delegates. It was revealed that most of the articled had advice on current topics, sarcasm and revelations. Endast sammandrag.
