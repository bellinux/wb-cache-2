40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, several European nations have {{introduced}} reforms to their electricity sector. Generally, these reforms require a legal and functional unbundling of vertically integrated companies.

40|$|Concerning {{reorganization}} of our countryls petrochemical complexes {{from the perspective}} of the competitive factors The bulk of the manufacturing process can be divided into three stages; olefin, monomer, and polymer. These plastics are the most commonly manufactured products in the petrochemical industry. When we think about the international competitiveness of the petrochemical industry, first, we must judge plant economics based on the following three points; <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> scale, <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration,</b> and <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> range. While the capacity of olefin plants established after 1990 in East Asia and the Middle East were about 800, 000 tons, most of our countryls olefin plants are outdated and their production capacity is, at best, 500, 000 tons. It is clear that the competitiveness of our olefin plants is lower in the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> scale. This is also true for monomer and polymer facilities. Furthermore, considering the easy access to crude oil in the Middle Eastern plants; the competitiveness of our plants is lower in the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> Next, a plant using naphtha can produce more varied chemical goods than a plant using ethane. Therefore, our naphtha plans are more competitive than the Middle Eastern ethane plants in the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> range. But, Japanls <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> range has been overcome by overseas plant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> and <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> scale. When we think about the international competitiveness of the petrochemical industry, we must consider the location of the petrochemical complex. In the United States, most of the petrochemical complexes are conveniently located in Texas and Louisiana and linked mostly by pipe, which can be useful to the domestic petrochemical industry, which can be described as " the <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> network". On the contrary, our petrochemical complexes are too distantly located and can not all be connected by pipe. But our complexes are isolated and this diminishes competitiveness of our industry. Until 2004, our resin market was protected by a high tariff, but, now we can import cheaper petrochemical products made in East Asian and Middle Eastern plants. Domestic petrochemical production capacity should be reduced and investment in bigger overseas plants should be increased. At present, to benefit the national economy, we should decrease the domestic petrochemical production capacity, and expand imports from favorable overseas plants...|$|R
40|$|The paper sets a {{framework}} for value generation in mass customization based e-business models. Trad itionally, mass customization was argued to be possible due to the advances of modern manufacturing technology. The paper discusses why mass customization is rather an application of electronic commerce than a manufacturing approach. Not flexible manufacturing capabilities but innovative information technologies enabling the integration of each single customer into value creation allow the strategic position of a mass customization system. Customer integration becomes {{the foundation of a}} new set of economies. The paper shows how these <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> underlie the cost and profit structures of a mass customization based ebusiness model.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand towards {{products and services}} that perfectly matches the customer needs is evident, so the manufacturing trends are aiming to produce small unit of customized product in large total volumes. The advances in manufacturing and information technologies provided great opportunities to achieve cost-effective mass customization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to have a holistic view on under-standing how entrepreneurs in small companies employ and effectively manage mass customization realization. The focus was placed in identifying what are the major factors that influence successful mass customization, how available technologies are enabling this process and how companies achieve value co-creation with the customers. In order to study the practical implementation of mass customization four case studies have been conducted. The information gathered was categorized and the preliminary theoretical framework was used as a template to compare the empirical results. The results show that every strategy for mass customization has to be customizes according to the particular product/service, market, customers, and the available technology for cost efficient implementation of mass customization. In a mass customization system value co-creation is achieved by direct customer integration and is benefiting from <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> The challenge is to balance the system to the right degree, so socially and technologically efficient environment can bring higher value for the customers and better business opportunities for the companies.

40|$|The 1993 Railways Act proposes the re?organization, {{privatization}} and {{deregulation of the}} rail industry in Great Britain. The economic case for these reforms has recently been put forward in an important paper by Sir Christopher Foster. In this paper, we assess the economics of rail {{privatization and}} identify four potential problem areas. Firstly, {{it is not clear}} whether the structural reforms being undertaken are appropriate for an industry of rail's technological complexity nor whether a system of negotiated contracts will lead to lower transactions costs than a system of administered commands. Secondly, the vertical separation of infrastructure and operations ignores the likelihood of <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> at strategic (investment planning, land?use planning), tactical (maintenance planning) and operational (planning to deal with infrastructure and vehicle failure) levels. Furthermore, there are practical problems in determining infrastructure costs and hence price and of regulating the infrastructure monopoly. Thirdly, there is only limited economic evidence to justify the horizontal separation of rail operations into 30 plus firms. There is some empirical and practical evidence suggesting that there may be diseconomies of scope from jointly operating freight and passenger services and that unbundling these services may be sensible. Similarly, there is some empirical evidence to suggest that, in purely cost terms, British Rail's operations may be too large. However, the evidence suggests that a split into three or four operators would be more efficient than the 30 plus that is being proposed. Fourthly, there are a number of areas of concern over franchising. These include that bidding may not be competitive, that even if there is competition the winning bid may not be efficient and that contracts will be difficult to specify, award, enforce and renew. Where franchising is not exclusive, it is likely that franchises will require a substantial risk premium. We agree that there is a case for continued reform of the British railway industry. Foster argues that the current reforms will lead to an increase in both productive and allocative efficiency and hence a net gain to society. Although we agree that productive efficiency gains are likely, we think that allocative efficiency gains are more problematic. Overall, we believe the economic evidence favours a more cautious approach to railway reform...|$|E

There are two avenues to merge water utilities, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration.

Vertical integration enables water distributors and water wholesalers, such as the bulk water supply systems, to merge into one.

40|$|Standard {{theoretical}} arguments tell us {{that countries}} with relatively little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows in and speeds up the process of convergence. We show in calibrated exercises that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for the typical emerging country. The traditional theory, then, {{does not seem to}} provide a sufficient rationale for capital account liberalization. Our approach emphasizes instead that poor countries face a number of distortions that prevent the allocation of production inputs to their most efficient uses. Liberalization of the capital account should then be understood as a means to eliminate or reduce these distortions, and it is this effect of liberalization that may create first order gains. As an illustration of this approach, we present a model in which capital account account liberalization improves domestic allocative efficiency because of its effect on property rights. Our theory has implications for the political <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>integration.</b> First, we show that politicians may open the capital account as a way of "locking-in" domestic reform, even when they cannot commit to either decision. Second, traditional trade arguments (e. g. Stolper-Samuelson) would argue that in capital-scarce countries, domestic capitalists would oppose financial integration as it reduces the return to capital, while workers would typically favor it. The political <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>integration</b> does not seem to reflect these predictions.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{focuses on}} {{distributed}} technologies {{with the aim}} of highlighting their economic-organizational dimensions. In particular, the contribution first presents {{a deeper understanding of the}} nature and the dynamic <b>of</b> the <b>economies</b> and diseconomies that arise from the adoption and diffusion of distributed technologies. Second, it aims to shed light on the increasing tension between the hierarchy-based model of production and peer production (p 2 p), which involves the pervasive diffusion of distributed technologies. Design/methodology/approach – Adopting an economic-organizational perspective, which is deeply rooted in the related extant literature, an analytically consistent model is developed to simultaneously take into account the following variables: adoption density independent variable) and <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>integration</b> and organizational diseconomies (the costs of a loss of control and the costs of organizational decoupling and recoupling) as dependent variables. Findings- Distributed technologies allow access to a large quantity and a wide variety of cognitive slacks that have not been possible until now. In doing so, they are leading the transition towards p 2 p. This is an emerging production paradigm that is characterized – with respect to mass production - by a shift of the relative importance of cognitive slack in comparison with tangible slack. Nevertheless, the unrestrainable diffusion of distributed technologies is not neutral for organizations. On the one hand, these technologies allow for the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, and on the other hand, they involve organizational diseconomies that should not be ignored by managers and researchers. Originality/value- This paper fills a gap in the literature by developing a consistent analytical framework that simultaneously takes into account the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>integration</b> and potential organizational diseconomies (the costs of coordination and the loss of control) that arise from the adoption and diffusion of distributed technologies.
