5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and <b>everybody</b> <b>will</b> grow rich.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{event in the}} interchange of East and West occurred when American psychologist William James invited the Sri Lankan Buddhist Anagarika Dharmapala to lecture in his classes at Harvard University in December 1903. After Dharmapala lectured on Buddhism, James remarked, “This is the psychology <b>everybody</b> <b>will</b> be studying 25 years from now.” Later scholars such as David Kalupahana (The principles of Buddhist psychology, 1987), Padmal de Silva (Buddhism and behaviour modification, 1984), Edwina Pio (Buddhist Psychology: A Modern Perspective, 1988) and Hubert Benoit (Zen and the Psychology of Transformation, 1990) wrote about and compared Buddhism and Psychology directly. Writers {{in the field of}} Transpersonal psychology (which deals with religious experience, altered states of consciousness and similar topics) such as Ken Wilber also integrated Buddhist thought and practice into their work.|$|E

25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And <b>everybody</b> <b>will</b> realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but <b>everybody</b> <b>will</b> {{be talking about it}} to everybody else.

A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

So I looked , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… <b>everybody</b> <b>will</b> have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E
