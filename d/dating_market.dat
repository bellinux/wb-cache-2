40|$|A {{drawback}} to research on interracial couplings {{is that it}} almost exclusively studies heterosexual relationships. However, compelling new evidence from analyses using the Census shows that interracial relationships are significantly more common among the gay population. It is unclear {{how much of this}} reflects weaker racial preference or more limited <b>dating</b> <b>markets.</b> This paper brings unique individual -level data rather than couple-level data to bear on what might be driving the difference. We examine the interactions of white gay and straight online daters who have access to a large market of potential partners by modeling dyadic messaging behaviors. Results show that preference behavior is highly gendered, and does not line up neatly by gay or straight identity. White lesbians and straight men show the weakest same-race preference, followed by gay men, while straight women show the strongest same-race preference. Our results indicate that white gay men’s higher rates of interracial cohabitation are driven more by constrained <b>dating</b> <b>markets,</b> while lesbians’ appear to be driven by more open racial preferences. This paper is the first to analyze the racial preferences of gays and lesbians in the mate selection process by directly observing online behavioral dynamics rather than stated preference...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives several simple {{matching}} algorithms {{for special}} cases of a continuous two sided matching model where agents have single peaked preferences and face no costs or restrictions to matching. These algorithms allow matches to be computed as an explicit {{function of the}} parameters of the model, making them convenient for use in theoretical matching market models, such as <b>dating</b> <b>markets.</b> One such theoretical model is solved and analyzed. Finally, several possible extensions and topics for further study are explored, such as adding noise to observed types and allowing misreporting of type. ...|$|R

She had trouble coming to terms with her own illness. By this time, the recession had worsened. She had been fighting to keep her company afloat but by 1974 she was in debt and decided to sell her company. She called John Paterson of Dateline and offered Com-Pat to him, if her would agree to pay all of the company's debts as part of the purchase. Seeing that this was a way to monopolize the computer <b>dating</b> <b>market</b> in the UK by doing away with Dateline's only major competitor, Patterson quickly agreed.|$|E
5000|$|Family and [...] {{have been}} declining in their {{influence}} over the <b>dating</b> <b>market</b> for the past 60 years. In the past 15 years, {{the rise of the}} Internet has also displaced the neighborhood, the workplace, and the circle of friends as sources of dating partners. As of May 2013, it was estimated that 11% of adult Americans had used online dating websites or mobile dating applications, and 59% of American Internet users agreed that online dating was a good way to meet people. China's largest online dating site reported over 100 million users in September 2013. For couples that have been together for more than a year, the choice of venue (online vs. real life) had little influence on relationship success.|$|E

Also in the cast was Charlene's boyfriend, Ronnie Underwood (Rick Overton), a restaurant owner.

50|$|SDL {{offers the}} promise of a unified <b>marketing</b> theory: To <b>date,</b> <b>marketing</b> {{research}} and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful. Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.|$|R
40|$|Date is {{as one of}} the {{important}} items of the agricultural production in Iran as Iran's share of global production was 14. 1 % in 2012 and rank of production increased to second in the world too. In recent years, price uncertainty in <b>date</b> <b>market</b> has increased due to changes in government policies on date prices pattern, from a guaranteed buying pattern to negotiated price pattern. According to the importance of this industry in the country and issues that are always in marketing and market making of agricultural products in developing countries, This paper seeks to measure marketing margins in the industry due to the product's market power and price volatility, and to achieve this goal, the main idea of this paper based on the study Brorsen et al (11). This paper provides a conceptual and empirical framework for analyzing marketing margins in a <b>date</b> <b>market</b> facing output price uncertainty in Iran. Present study evaluated marketing margins into component reflecting the marginal cost of the processing industry, oligopoly price distortions, and an output risk component. The empirical finding is that, while marketing margin is about 33 %, the coefficient for oligopoly is more than the coefficient for oligopsony. In the other words, there is an asymmetric monopoly power among buyers and sellers, Also the estimated coefficient for price risk based on exponential GARCH approach indicates, this factor would affect the marketing margin about 7 percent, if all other factors remain constant...|$|R

5000|$|A 1997 poll in the Japanese TV Asahi program Asa Made Nama Terebi {{showed that}} 70 percent of {{respondents}} opposed enjo-kōsai involving sexual interactions, while 30 percent approved of it. Typically, it is perceived {{as an extension of}} Japan's growing focus on materialism, much of which is what critics claim is the cause of enjo-kōsai. Critics worry that girls involved in enjo-kōsai will grow up to be unfit wives and mothers. This perception arises from suspicions that when these girls are adults, they will quickly abandon their loyalties and commitments to their family for offers of money and material benefits. However, certain feminist groups and critics regard enjo-kōsai as an empowering way to [...] "undermine patriarchal models of propriety used to evaluate and control women". Control over their bodies and means to support themselves is a new kind of independence for these girls. Good women in Japan are supposed to be sensible, modest, nurturing and respectful, yet girls participating in enjo-kōsai clearly reject such virtues of female restraint and modesty in Japan. Feminists such as Chizuko Ueno point out that the accidental access of girls to this <b>dating</b> <b>market</b> was not a matter of ethics, but of probability. Sooner or later, these girls and young women would, in a desire for financial independence, tap into this market for their own empowerment.|$|E
