25|$|In {{this new}} Play, I {{attempted}} {{to follow the}} old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators {{were about to be}} exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.|$|E
500|$|So I {{went home}} and called my dog, E Base, who plays a lot of {{instruments}} up at Baseline [...] for me and [...] Just Blaze. [...] came through. I programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different parts. This version is all live bass, live guitars, [...] chords on it. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to Hov that night, he heard it, {{he thought of the}} video treatment before he thought of the rap. He just knew it was gonna be the one.|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lef√®vre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I guessed, {{on second}} thoughts, {{that it was}} yours, my lady,' said Tabitha, with rather a frightened face; 'and so <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I took it an {{hour after}} <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to this house--and three hours before anybody was {{prepared}} for seeing me in these parts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pooh! pooh! I tell you,' {{returned}} Mr Folair, {{waving his}} hand in deprecation of any further wrath; 'I wasn't in earnest. <b>I</b> only <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> in joke.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Daryl Braithwaite's cover {{version of}} Rickie Lee Jones' album track, [...] "The Horses", {{remained}} popular after 25 years. In May 2016 Braithwaite recalled [...] "I rang Simon Hussey, who was producing Rise, and said, 'Simon, you've gotta listen to this. I'll {{bring it in}} tomorrow and I reckon we could do a version in the vein of 'As the Days Go By' from the first album, Edge. Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> in {{and they had a}} listen to it." [...] He acknowledged that [...] "you have to give credit to , who then took [...] version and turned it into more accessible pop, maybe. There's no doubt: I love it. I will fight for it, I will stick up for it. I know {{at the end of the}} day it's not mine." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to him, {{he seized}} it greedily and drank it out.|$|E
60|$|A. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> {{home and}} hid it {{in a secret}} place in my observatory, {{intending}} to find the owner if I could.|$|E
6000|$|Pardon {{this early}} call. The packet's in, [...] And wings me this {{unreadable}} Dutch paper, [...] So, as the offices are closed to-day, [...] <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> round to you.|$|R
60|$|But {{he said to}} her, 'I {{have found}} {{something}} in the forest, and <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] she answered. [...] "But I {{was going}} to tell you. He came again to-night while the {{performance}} was on, and sent a note round. <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> for you to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That awful {{evening in}} Boulogne... what that fiend demanded... his awful 'either--or'... <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> all upon you... {{it was all}} my fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{from that}} miserable Alexis! Oh, I know <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on myself, and I {{have been so}} wretched and so ashamed all day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{thought you}} would like to hear about Phyllis, so, having enjoyed it with Ada, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> over for further {{enjoyment}} with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The officer unslung a flask {{from his}} shoulder. [...] "This is weak brandy-and-water. <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> over for you. I {{am sorry to}} hear your brother is so bad, but the doctor gives strong hopes of him in his report." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me at {{all events}} try you. It's {{moreover}} the one I just promised; which was no more indeed than {{the development of a}} feeling I've already permitted myself to show you. <b>I</b> lose"--I <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> out--"by your agreeing with me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a better}} remedy {{even than the}} blue-glass bottle," [...] she said; [...] "it cures you so soon when you are tired, or troubled in your mind, that <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> away with me from Wurzburg, {{to use it for}} myself." ...|$|R
60|$|After all, it's my own fault. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on myself, and I {{must take}} the consequences.... But I haven't the strength, I don't love her.|$|E
6000|$|Ottima. [...] Here's the wine; [...] <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> when we {{left the}} house above, [...] 55 [...] And glasses too--wine of both sorts. Black? White then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would want to have it again," [...] Grizel said brightly, {{producing}} the little parcel from her pocket, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gave her}} my money--it was, of course, only paper <b>I</b> had <b>brought.</b> <b>I</b> gave <b>it</b> her, {{to be her}} marriage-portion, I declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Without. <b>I</b> {{would have}} <b>brought</b> <b>it,</b> but your {{servants}} {{told me that}} it is death to come armed before the 'Elephant who shakes the Earth.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can take}} her nowhere, nor will I see her, till {{she has given}} proof that her whole conduct towards me has been altered. I have written a letter to her, and <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it.</b> Will you excuse me if I ask {{you to take the}} trouble to read it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is, old man--in notes. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> on purpose. Will {{you really}} take the thing on? Do {{you think you}} can work it for five hundred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, maister, {{there was}} a little one upon the edge of her plate when <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> out; and so it must have been in her few leaves of wintergreen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{will attend}} to all that," [...] said I, {{and picking up}} her bicycle, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to her. She made a little step towards it, and then stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. Go on. I {{know you}} think that <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> all on myself by my own wickedness. Pay this man the money, and then if {{anything}} be said about it, explain {{that it was my}} fault, and say that you paid the money because I had done wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had an uncle, Alan Blair, {{who died}} {{forty years ago}} in California," [...] I said quietly. [...] "Recently I have had {{occasion}} to examine some of his papers.

6000|$|... "They are. When Dad {{broke up}} the house and {{went to live with}} Kate I put in a bid for the stuff and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> some of <b>it</b> out here with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You know, master,' said Hugh, 'that I couldn't {{read the}} bill I found, and that supposing {{it to be}} {{something}} particular from {{the way it was}} wrapped up, <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad the}} calm held," [...] he said. [...] "It {{enabled me to}} get around to see you. My {{supercargo}} dug up that little note of yours, and <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{said the}} Shaggy Man, impressively, [...] "is the {{wonderful}} Love Magnet. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to the Emerald City myself, and all who pass beneath this gateway are both loving and beloved." ...|$|E
