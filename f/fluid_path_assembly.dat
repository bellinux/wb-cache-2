40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the class of d-dimensional diﬀusion processes known as semi-martingales reﬂecting Brownian motions (SRBMs). Such processes arise as approximations for open d-station queueing networks. The data for such a process are a drift vector θ, a non-singular d×d covariance matrix Σ, and a d×d reﬂection matrix R. A standard problem is to determine under what conditions the process is positive recurrent. Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate for d = 2, but not for d > 2. Associated with the pair (θ,R) are <b>ﬂuid</b> <b>paths,</b> which are solutions of deterministic equations corresponding to the random equations of the SRBM.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a pre-pressurization <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> (consisting a damping hole, a buffer chamber, and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the pre-pressurization <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|R

40|$|Semimartingale {{reflecting}} Brownian motions (SRBMs) are diffusion processes {{with state}} space the d-dimensional nonnegative orthant, {{in the interior}} of which the processes evolve according to a Brownian motion, and that reflect against the boundary in a specified manner. The data for such a process are a drift vector θ, a nonsingular d × d covariance matrix Σ, and a d × d reflection matrix R. A standard problem is to determine under what conditions the process is positive recurrent. Necessary and sufficient conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate for d = 2, but not for d > 2. Associated with the pair (θ, R) are <b>fluid</b> <b>paths,</b> which are solutions of deterministic equations corresponding to the random equations of the SRBM. A standard result of Dupuis and Williams [6] states that when every <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> associated with the SRBM is attracted to the origin, the SRBM is positive recurrent. Employing this result, El Kharroubi et al. [7, 8] gave sufficient conditions on (θ,Σ,R) for positive recurrence for d = 3; Bramson et al. [2] showed that these conditions are, in fact, necessary. Relatively {{little is known about the}} recurrence behavior of SRBMs for d > 3. This pertains, in particular, to necessary conditions for positive recurrence. Here, we provide a family of examples, in d = 6, with θ = (- 1, - 1,. >.., - 1) T, Σ = I and appropriate R, that are positive recurrent, but for which a linear <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> diverges to infinity. These examples show in particular that, for d >= 6, the converse of the Dupuis-Williams result does not hold. Comment: 40 page...|$|R

30|$|Sep-Pak {{purification}} cartridges (Sep-Pak), e.g., silica, C 18, etc., {{are connected}} to designated Luer fittings on the cassette. A dip tube (e.g., made of Teflon® tubing with an outside diameter (OD) of 1 / 8 in.) {{is built into the}} cassette to act as the <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> for the transfer of crude products. Tubing with an OD of 1 / 8 in. is necessary when transferring synthesis products that produce precipitates, but 1 / 16 in. tubing may be installed for smaller volume transfers. The transfer unit operation begins with the reaction vessel sealing against the transfer position on the cassette (Figures  4 and 5). The gas supplier provides inert gas to pressurize the reaction vessel. This moves the fluid through the dip tube and to the Sep-Pak. After the Sep-Pak, a dedicated stopcock valve in the cassette switches between a <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> towards a waste collection vial installed on the cassette and a tube that can be plumbed to the input of the next cassette. Often, {{the first step is to}} trap the crude product onto the Sep-Pak and allow the residual solution to collect in the waste container. The stopcock position is switched, and elution of the desired product into the next reaction vessel is then performed by adding the elution solvent to the first reaction vessel and repeating the transfer unit operation to elute the product from the Sep-Pak.|$|R
