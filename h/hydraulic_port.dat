40|$|In many {{applications}} that require physical interaction with humans or other physical environments, passivity {{is a useful}} property to have {{in order to improve}} safety and ease of use. Many mechatronic applications (e. g. teleoperators, robots that interact with humans) fall into this category. In this paper, we develop an approach to design passifying control laws for mechatronic components from a bond graph perspective. Two new bond graph elements with power scaling properties are first introduced and the passivity property of bond graphs containing these elements are investigated. These elements are used to better model mechatronic systems that have embedded energy sources. A procedure for passifying mechatronic systems is then developed using the four way directional electrohydraulic flow control valve as an example. The passified valve is a two-port system that is passive with respect to the scaled power input at the command and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ports.</b> This is achieved by representing the control valve in a suitable augmented bond graph, and then by replacing the signal bonds with power scaling elements. The procedure generalizes a previous passifying control law resulting in improved performance. Similar procedure can be applied to other mechatronic systems...|$|R

The quality and effectivity of control systems is rising with help of simulation environments. We have decided to use products of The MathWorks, Matlab/Simulink and Matlab/SimScape for modeling of heating systems. Matlab/SimScape libraries contain special blocks for modeling hydraulic, thermal and mechanical components, which {{has been used to}} model this system. 1 Description of modeling environment Simulink- is a graphical user interface for modeling and simulation of block schematics. The core of the Matlab is used to compute the simulating results. Simulink is primarily used for modeling dynamic systems. Simulink’s libraries offer a plenty of blocks useful for modeling complex systems. With help of integrating methods, we can simulate the system and analyze it in time. Simscape – is a library of basic real world mechanics, hydraulics and electronics components. System, built from these blocks, is modeled from view of energy flow. Model works directly with physical parameters, so it approximates good real systems. Simscape generates differential equations from the modeled system that can communicate with other components from Matlab/Simulink after the simulation has been started. SimHydraulics – is a tool for modeling and simulation of hydraulic systems. It allows modeling of multi-domain systems, which contain connection of hydraulic and mechanical components. 2 Block description Model of heating system was built-up according to project of real heating system. Modeling of three-way mixing valve was ignored, because its main task is anti-corrosive protection. 2. 1 Pump model For modeling of pump, we’ve chosen fixed-displacement pump model, from Simscape/ SimHydraulics/Pumps and Motors library.

40|$|Waterborne {{transport}} infrastructures play {{a crucial}} role in global integration, and ports are key components to materialise this amalgamation. However they are constantly challenged to keep fulfilling their functions in a changing environment. Port of Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe and the Western hemisphere too, faces those challenges on a daily basis. In order to maintain and enhance the future efficiency of the Harbour Industrial Complex, strategic adaptations based on long-term planning are required. This is more relevant on those existing port areas such as Europoort, where basic infrastructure is approaching the end of their life cycle, and fragmentation of original plots led to inefficient use of the land and some waterfront areas. In order to meet these needs, this study presents the application of Adaptive Port Planning framework (Taneja, 2013) to the existing Europoort Masterplan for increasing its robustness while ensuring that the port has the license-to-operate and the license-to-grow in the long-term. The Adaptive Port Planning approach goes further than the traditional port planning approach throughout incorporating uncertainty and flexibility considerations.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{continuous}} cast steel is greatly {{affected by the}} turbulent flow in the mold region, especially for transient operation and transport of inclusion particles. During the continuous casting process, shown in Figure 1, the superheated molten steel flows into the mold region from the tundish through the nozzle ports. The molten steel freezes against the water-cooled mold walls to form solidified slab shells, which are continuously withdrawn from the bottom at the casting speed. The jets entering the mold region carry inclusion particles (e. g. alumina) and argon bubbles, which will either be safely transported to the top surface and removed by the slag layer or get entrapped in the final product, resulting in costly defects (e. g. internal cracks, blisters etc.). The flow in the mold is turbulent with Reynolds numbers in excess of 105 (based on the nozzle <b>port</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameter). Plant observations found that the transient nature of this turbulent flow greatly influences the transport of the inclusions and bubbles, causing intermittent defects.

40|$|Two-phase {{ejectors}} are devices {{capable of}} improving the performance of refrigeration and air conditioning cycles by means of expansion work recovery. Ejector studies often focus on the design and performance of the two-phase ejector and the effect it can have {{on the performance of}} the ejector cycle. However, the ejector is not the only component of the system that can have a significant influence on the performance of the ejector cycle. Recent experimental work has shown that the effect of evaporator design on ejector cycle performance can be quite significant, though there is very little research available on the relation between evaporator design and ejector cycle performance. In this paper, a numerical model of a microchannel air-to-refrigerant evaporator, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects, is developed and used to investigate the effect that different evaporator dimensions have on the performance of ejector cycles. The model is validated with experimental data from previous ejector cycle studies. There are two ejector cycles of interest: The standard ejector cycle, in which the ejector is used to directly lift the compressor suction pressure, and the ejector recirculation cycle, in which the ejector recirculates excess liquid through the evaporator but does not directly lift compressor suction pressure. The effects of microchannel <b>port</b> <b>hydraulic</b> diameter, number of evaporator passes, refrigerant outlet state, and air-side resistance are investigated.

40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from the workpieces thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the weld. The inventive apparatus is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an arbor supported by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are <b>ported</b> <b>hydraulic</b> passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a piston housed therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is moveably seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs the workpieces while the lower face of the shoulder housing compacts the workpieces. As the welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards the workpieces thus extending the pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in the workpieces regardless of their thicknesses. As the weld terminates this same operation {{can be used to}} incrementally withdraw the pin during the final part of the traverse, thus eliminating any keyhole or crater that would otherwise be created...|$|R
40|$|The Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor EHC was {{evaluated}} against DOE applications for compressing hydrogen at automobile filling stations, in future hydrogen pipelines {{and as a}} commercial replacement for conventional diaphragm hydrogen compressors. It was also evaluated as a modular replacement for the compressors used in petrochemical refineries. If the EHC can be made inexpensive, reliable and long lived then it can satisfy all these applications save pipelines where the requirements for platinum catalyst exceeds the annual world production. The research performed did not completely investigate Molybdenum as a hydrogen anode or cathode, it did show that photoetched 316 stainless steel is inadequate for an EHC. It also showed that: molybdenum bipolar plates, photochemical etching processes, and Gortex Teflon seals are too costly for a commercial EHC. The use of carbon paper in combination with a perforated thin metal electrode demonstrated adequate anode support strength, but is suspect in promoting galvanic corrosion. The nature of the corrosion mechanisms are not well understood, but locally high potentials within the unit cell package are probably involved. The program produced a design with an extraordinary high cell pitch, and a very low part count. This {{is one of the}} promising aspects of the redesigned EHC. The development and successful demonstration of the hydraulic cathode is also important. The problem of corrosion resistant metal bipolar plates is vital to the development of an inexpensive, commercial PEM fuel cell. Our research suggests that there is more to the corrosion process in fuel cells and electrochemical compressors than simple, steady state, galvanic stability. It is an important area for scientific investigation. The experiments and analysis conducted lead to several recommended future research directions. First, we need {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion mechanisms involved. The diagnosis of experimental cells with titration to determine the loss of membrane active sites is recommended. We suspect that the corrosion includes more than simple galvanic mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are poorly understood. Shunt currents at <b>hydraulic</b> cathode <b>ports</b> were problematic, but are not difficult to cure. In addition to corrosion there is evidence of high component resistivity. This may be due to the deposition of organic compounds, which may be produced electrochemically on the surface of the metal support screens that contact carbon gas diffusion layers (GDLs) or catalyst supports. An investigation of possible electro-organic sythesis mechanisms with emphasis on oxalates formation is warranted. The contaminated cell parts can be placed in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperature and the weight loss can be observed. This would reveal the existence of organic compounds. Investigation into the effects of conductivity enhancers such as carbon microlayers on supporting carbon paper is also needed. Corrosion solutions should be investigated such as surface passivation of 316 SS parts using nitric acid. Ultra thin silane/siloxane polymer coatings should be tried. These may be especially useful in conjunction with metal felt replacement of carbon paper. A simple cure for the very high, localized corrosion of the anode might be to diffusion bond the metal electrode support screen to bipolar plate. This will insure uniform resistance perpendicular to the plane of the cell and eliminate some of the dependence of the resistance on high stack compression. Alternative materials should be explored. Alternatives to carbon in the cell may be helpful in any context. In particular, alternatives to carbon paper GDLs such as metal felts and alternatives to carbon supports for Pt such as TiC and TiB 2 might also be worthwhile and would be helpful to fuel cells as well. Some alternative to the metals we used in the cell, Mo and 316 SS, are potentially useful. These include Al/Mg/Si alloys. Corrosion resistant materials such as Nb and Mo might prove useful as cladding materials that can be hot stamped. Several cost reduction areas should be explored. Such as the water pumps used in pressure washers. The power consumption of these pumps is a concern, but their cost is surprisingly low. Two components of unit cell construction proved to be extremely costly. The first of these is photoetching, where selective etching of alloys present a corrodible composition in the cell. An alternative to photoetching may be hot stamping. An investigation of materials for hot stamping and the dimension tolerance attainable with this process should be first on the agenda. Hot stamping of clad materials should also be studied. Photoetched electrode supports can be replaced with expanded metal screens (Dexmet). The other high cost area is the use of Gortex TFE seals. Analytic’s prior experience with Acrylic seals shows they can probably replace TFE...|$|R
40|$|The {{space in}} the Port of Rotterdam is getting scarce due {{to the growth of}} the port. This is the reason why the port {{authority}} shows the ambition to intensify the {{space in the}} port. The EMO-peninsula on the first Maasvlakte is one of the areas in the port where {{there is a lack of}} space. There are three companies who are based on the peninsula. These are: EMO (dry bulk terminal), Electrabel (new coal/biomass power plant) and Gasunie (small LNG-storage). The lack of space on the peninsula is caused by: enlargement of a port basin, the new coal/biomass power plant and the expected growth of EMO. A capacity analysis shows that the EMO-peninsula is indeed short of space. The focus, of the intensification of space, is laid on the dry bulk storage of EMO and the handling and storage of biomass on the peninsula. All the alternatives to increase space capacity are generated by a brainstorm. The alternative keerwand (see picture) is elected as the best solution for the dry bulk storage problem of EMO. For the handling and storage of biomass, the best alternatives are the same as the current ideas. That is why only the alternative keerwand is developed and looked at in this study. Alternative keerwand The alternative keerwand contains of a retaining wall on both sides of the storage to enlarge the volume of the storage. Moreover, the volume will also be increased by adjusting the machine that is used for stacking and reclaiming the dry bulk, this machine is called the kombi. This will lead to more storage volume on top of the storage. The alternative shows benefits on different levels. These are: gain in space, financial positive, technically feasible and environmental attractive. The keerwand alternative results in a gain of space of 15, 3 %. The investment and the operational costs are relatively low. The construction of the retaining wall and the transformation of the kombi are technically feasible. Because of the relation between the surface and the volume of the storage is small, dust will be reduced to a minimum. A disadvantage of the alternative is the freedom of movement of shovels and dumpers. They have to drive around the construction to reach their destination. In comparison to many other alternatives to increase storage capacity in the port, this study proves that space intensification (keerwand) is really interesting for a dry bulk terminal. It is even more attractive than expanding or move the terminal to a new location. Especially the financial benefits are very positive. The investment and operational cost are considerably low. The most important argument against this alternative is the limited freedom of movement. Space intensification EMO-schiereiland The main conclusion of this study is that space intensification on the EMO-peninsula is feasible and interesting. By the use of space intensification there is no necessity for companies to expand on another location outside of the peninsula on the first Maasvlakte.
