40|$|Cognitive <b>distortions</b> are an {{important}} focus in many investigations and treatments of externalizing problem behavior, such as antisocial, delinquent, and aggressive behavior. Yet the overall strength of the association between cognitive <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether interventions can effectively reduce cognitive <b>distortions</b> and subsequently externalizing behavior. To fill these gaps, we conducted a meta-analysis of 71 studies on 20, 685 participants. Results showed a medium to large effect size (d =. 70) for the association between cognitive <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior. Interventions had a small effect (d =. 27) on reducing cognitive <b>distortions.</b> In a subset of intervention studies that incorporated both cognitive <b>distortions</b> and externalizing behavior, however, neither cognitive <b>distortions</b> nor externalizing behavior were effectively reduced. Hence, although cognitive <b>distortions</b> are substantially linked to externalizing behavior and interventions can reduce cognitive <b>distortions,</b> a subsequent reduction in externalizing behavior remains to be demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (<b>distortion</b> of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (<b>distortion</b> of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (<b>distortion</b> of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce <b>distortion</b> and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of <b>distortion.</b> Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and <b>distortion,</b> both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

In order to avoid <b>distortions</b> by a proper control of the bonding process, {{a thorough understanding of}} the development of <b>distortions</b> is necessary. Finite element simulations can help to gain insight into this development. In this work, a simulation model is proposed and used to study the appearance of <b>distortions</b> in a steel sheet over different temperature cycles. The model takes chemical shrinkage and thermal deformation as well as gelation and stress relaxation into account. It was found that the heating rate can affect <b>distortions.</b> Lowering the cure temperature only lowers <b>distortions</b> for high temperature rates.

5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage <b>distortion,</b> owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic <b>distortion</b> below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic <b>distortion</b> can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E
5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current <b>distortion,</b> and hence voltage <b>distortion,</b> of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic <b>distortion</b> of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

Subsequently, the relationship was investigated of cognitive <b>distortions,</b> moral judgment and empathy with externalizing problem behaviour.
