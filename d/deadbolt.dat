500|$|In {{his review}} of The Simpsons - The Complete Eleventh Season, Brian Tallerico of The <b>Deadbolt</b> {{considered}} [...] "Brother's Little Helper" [...] {{to be one of}} the season's best episodes. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was favorable as well, calling the episode [...] "pretty good" [...] and that it [...] "provides some good laughs". He especially liked seeing Bart well-behaved. He also appreciated the episode's message, writing that [...] "the show offers a clever spotlight on [...] issue". He did, however, dislike the characterization of Bart. He wrote that Bart is normally [...] "not particularly overactive or distractible", and that the writers [...] "trie to make [...] seem more hyper than normal". He concluded by saying that [...] "Bart's a behavior problem but not ADHD." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large <b>deadbolt</b> on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deadbolts</b> â€” many {{manufacturers}} make <b>deadbolts</b> {{that are}} resistant to impact failure, picking and lock bumping. However, most <b>deadbolts</b> are not very secure.

Big John Bates was banned in one venue due to {{concerns}} about their overly risque stage antics. <b>Deadbolt</b> is known for its use of power tools during their live sets, and it is customary for the audience to be showered with sparks of red-hot metal during their live shows. King Kurt, a 1980s band, was known for its infamous [...] "food fight" [...] gigs, in which eggs and bags of flour were thrown around on and off stage and audience members were given free haircuts. [...] "King Kurt had a bad reputation for doing things that would make people question the band's stability. These included going on stage in dresses, dressed as Zulus, and playing drinking games on stage. Tabloids often accused them of mixing drugs ...into whatever they made people drink on stage, tossing dead animals into the crowds, and rampant sex occurring as they played." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of Indiana Jones 5 {{continued to be}} discussed through 2009 and 2010. Reports speculated in June 2009 that the next installment would start filming in 2011 with a plot involving the Bermuda Triangle, although these rumors were later described as [...] "completely false" [...] by Frank Marshall on his Twitter page. Speaking to BBC journalist Lizo Mzimba in June 2009, LaBeouf confirmed that [...] "Steven [...] just said that he cracked the story on it , I think they're gearing that up." [...] Lucas stated {{he was working on}} the film as of December 2009. In November 2010, Ford said that he and Spielberg were waiting for Lucas to present an idea to them. In March 2011, the <b>Deadbolt</b> website interviewed Karen Allen and asked her about the fifth film's status. [...] "What I know is that there's a story that they like", said Allen, [...] "which is a huge step forward. I heard this about six months ago, that they have a story that they like and they're working on it." [...] In July 2012, Frank Marshall indicated that the film was unlikely to be announced in the near future, saying: [...] "I don't know if it's definitely not happening, but it's not up and running... It's not on until there is a writer on the project. There is no writer on Indy." ...|$|E

50|$|A dead bolt, <b>deadbolt</b> or {{dead lock}} is a locking {{mechanism}} distinct from a spring bolt lock because a <b>deadbolt</b> cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A <b>deadbolt</b> can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the {{standard}} <b>deadbolt</b> is the vertical <b>deadbolt,</b> invented by Samuel Segal. Vertical deadbolts resist jimmying, in which an intruder inserts a pry bar between {{the door and the}} jamb and attempts to pry the bolt out of the door.|$|E
50|$|Apigy {{originally}} {{offered a}} full replacement door lock version of Lockitron in 2011 before announcing {{a version of}} Lockitron in 2012 which fit over preexisting <b>deadbolt</b> locks. The 2012 version of Lockitron incorporated a number of improvements over the 2011 Lockitron <b>deadbolt</b> including built-in WiFi, replacing a wired basestation, built-in auto-unlock technology through Bluetooth Low Energy, and a simplified installation by making Lockitron a device that fits over a preexisting <b>deadbolt</b> lock. The crowdfunded Lockitron was built around an ATMega microprocessor meaning that it is Arduino compatible for other custom behavior.|$|E

50|$|Builders' {{hardware}} or just builders hardware is a {{group of}} metal hardware specifically used for protection, decoration, and convenience in buildings. Building products do not make any part of a building, rather they support them and make them work. It usually supports fixtures like windows, doors, and cabinets. Common examples include door handles, door hinges, <b>deadbolts,</b> latches, numerals, letter plates, switch plates, and door knockers.|$|R
50|$|Sintered {{metal powder}} {{is used to}} make {{frangible}} shotgun shells called breaching rounds, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door <b>deadbolts,</b> locks and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.|$|R

50|$|A doorjamb, {{door jamb}} (also {{sometimes}} doorpost) is the vertical {{portion of the}} door frame onto which a door is secured. The jamb bears {{the weight of the}} door through its hinges, and most types of door latches and <b>deadbolts</b> extend into a recess in the doorjamb when engaged, making the accuracy of the plumb (i.e. true vertical) and strength of the doorjambs vitally important to the overall operational durability and security of the door.|$|R

50|$|FÃ©lix {{was shot}} {{following}} an altercation at his residence on Williams Street in Lamont, California {{on the night}} of 30 May 2006. According to the Kern County Sheriff's Department, he had been involved in an argument outside his apartment with a male described as being around 19-years old. During the confrontation, FÃ©lix was brandishing a large stick. Once the assailant pulled out a handgun, FÃ©lix ran into his apartment for protection and <b>deadbolted</b> the door, however the assailant was able to open the door enough to fire two shots inside. One of those shots hit FÃ©lix in the back. He died of his injuries an hour later at the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield.|$|R
50|$|Between June 14, 1962 and January 4, 1964, 13 {{single women}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 85 were murdered in the Boston area. Most were sexually {{assaulted}} and strangled in their apartments by what was assumed to be one man. With no sign of forced entry into their homes, the women were assumed to have let their assailant in, either because they knew him or because they believed him to be an apartment maintenance man, delivery man, or other service man. The attacks continued despite the enormous media publicity after the first few murders that presumably discouraged women from admitting strangers into their homes. Many residents purchased tear gas and new locks and <b>deadbolts</b> for their doors. Some women left the area altogether.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{pin tumbler}} locks {{are found in}} a {{cylinder}} {{that can be easily}} unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a cylinder lock, also known as a profile cylinder lock or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various lock manufacturers, cylinders in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, <b>deadbolts</b> and roller door locks.|$|R
5000|$|Door {{reinforcements}} â€” various {{products are}} made to prevent delamination and or splitting of the door. Sheet steel plate can be placed behind or under the <b>deadbolt</b> and wrap the door edge to prevent breaking the door around the <b>deadbolt.</b> Heavy duty products that place plates on either side the door tied together with screws or bolts {{can be used to}} prevent delamination.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deadbolt</b> : A <b>deadbolt</b> may be {{projected}} (thrown) {{only once}} {{the door is}} in the closed position; it will resist being forcibly retracted once it is in its projected position, hence {{is known as a}} deadlock.

50|$|Despite these problems, {{urban life}} is much {{safer and more}} {{convenient}} than in many other countries. In contrast to most industrialized nations, urban crime rates are declining. The streets of Tokyo are safe even at night, and a public campaign {{is more likely to}} urge residents to lock their doors than to suggest they install <b>deadbolts.</b> Public transportation is congested but convenient, clean, punctual, and relatively inexpensive. Complaints are heard, however, that railroad station parking lots are too small to accommodate all commuter bicycles. In urban areas, houses are close together; but at the same time, shops are close by, and housewives can easily purchase fresh vegetables and fish daily. Urban life is made more attractive for many by a wide variety of cultural and sports activities, including the symphony orchestra, theater, sumo, professional baseball, museums, and art galleries.|$|R
50|$|At her apartment, Laura is {{affected}} by one last vision of the killer, who has now come for her. The killer attempts to break in through her front door, but Laura <b>deadbolts</b> it before he/she can enter. Upon hearing her distress, Neville (who had been {{on his way to}} meet her) breaks through her balcony window. He proceeds to tell Laura they have caught the killer, a troubled colleague of hers named Tommy, and begins an elaborate explanation of Tommy's motivations and back story. Knowing Tommy well, Laura recognizes this as a lie and that Neville himself is the killer. As Neville details more of his own story, it is implied that he may have multiple personalities. Because of this, and his love for her, he cannot bring himself to murder her and instead asks that she end his life. She shoots him to death, calling the police as the camera view closes in on her eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Breaching rounds are {{designed}} to destroy door <b>deadbolts,</b> locks, and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door, as traditional buckshot can. These frangible rounds are made of a dense sintered material, often metal powder in a binder such as wax, which can destroy a lock or hinge and then immediately disperse. They are used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. Amongst police, these rounds are nicknamed [...] "master keys", and their use is known as [...] "Avon calling". Ideally, breaching rounds {{may be used in}} a standard combat shotgun or riot shotgun, or in a specialized shotgun, often attached to a rifle, such as the KAC Masterkey or M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System. The most effective use of this round is with a [...] "stand-off breacher" [...] attached to the muzzle of a specially converted shotgun. The stand-off is held {{on the surface of the}} door and vents gases to prevent overpressure.|$|R
