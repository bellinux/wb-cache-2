25|$|This {{plate is}} located {{behind the front}} right rear seat on Volkswagen Buses through 1976. In 1977, the {{location}} was moved to sit atop the air duct on the left side, just above the <b>fuse</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a hinged panel between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front wheel arch housed the battery, <b>fuse</b> <b>panel,</b> windscreen wiper motor and brake servos. [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car housed the spare wheel and jack.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 U.S. X1/9s also {{received}} both {{exterior and interior}} revisions including integrated bumpers front and rear, {{as well as new}} front grilles and airdams. The instrument panel and dash redesign moved the heating and ventilation controls from the center console up to the main dash, relocated the radio into the center dash area, moved the <b>fuse</b> <b>panel</b> from the area above the driver's left knee to the area above the passenger's footwell where the glovebox was, and moved the glovebox atop the dash.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse some {{mechanical}} properties and parameters of drapability using different methods from two different points of research area: knowledge bases and numerical modelling using the finite element method. The approach consists of analysing some mechanical properties and parameters of drapability using different methods from two different points of research areaÄŒ knowledge bases and numerical modelling using the finite element method. The knowledge bases, named FP_B- 1 and FPO_B- 2, were used to analyse the bending rigidity of <b>fused</b> <b>panels.</b> The numerical model of <b>fused</b> <b>panel</b> NMFP is used to analyse parameters of drapability. Findings - Based on the analyses of bending rigidity and draping of <b>fused</b> <b>panels</b> the conclusions indicate the significance of interaction between mechanical properties and parameters of drapability of thefused panel to garment appearance. Furthermore, the methods used present a computer approach to the study of the <b>fused</b> <b>panel</b> properties important for thecomputer-based engineering and the presentation of real behaviour of all aspects of clothes. This numerical model of a <b>fused</b> <b>panel</b> enables a 3 D observation of this aspect of clothes which is a behaviour, very important contribution to the computer planning of the behaviour of produced clothes. Originality is in a better understanding of how to construct <b>fused</b> <b>panels</b> in clothing...|$|R

Opposite the telephone, an alarm device is also {{mounted on the}} wall. The man is wearing a dark colored uniform with a chevron on his right sleeve. Beside him, are {{what appear to be}} two <b>fuse</b> <b>panels</b> - the larger one is on top, while the smaller one is visible on the bottom. At center, a small table stands with a telephone resting on it...|$|R
50|$|There is a 25 ft. {{stained glass}} above the altar, <b>fusing</b> 15 <b>panels</b> into one, created by Scottish artist Alex Ballantine and his {{assistant}} Gardiner, in order to commemorate the diamond jubilee {{of the reign of}} Queen Victoria in 1897. At the base, the Old Testament characters of Abraham, Moses, King David and Prophet Isaiah are painted. The top the apostles of Christ - St.Andrew, St Peter, St Paul and St John are painted. Above this, there is the burning bush which is the symbol of the Church of kirk, alpha symbol on the right and omega symbol on the right (signifying beginning and the end). On the very top is painted Jesus Christ.|$|R
5000|$|The {{school was}} {{constructed}} {{on a site}} acquired from Charles H. [...] "Charley" [...] Baker, {{who lived in the}} two story farmhouse on the corner. The original building burned to the ground in 1952, and the students were again bussed to Plainview while a new building was constructed. The cause of the fire may have been overloaded electrical circuits, because large bulbs were seen screwed into the <b>fuse</b> <b>panel</b> in the hallway. The current campus includes the land once occupied by the farmhouse and the student body is much larger.|$|E
50|$|Externally, {{a notable}} {{feature of the}} 404 and 405 was the {{abandonment}} of the BMW-style radiator grille for one much more like an aero-engine. The 405, although the only four-door car ever built by Bristol, had styling {{that the company was}} later to refine for many years on their later Chrysler V8-engined cars during the 1960s. It was also the model that introduced the Bristol feature of sizable lockers in the front wings accessed externally by gullwing doors. The locker on the nearside held the spare wheel and jack, whilst that on the offside housed the battery and <b>fuse</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The GLE's {{enhancements}} {{included a}} digital head-up display (1993 and 1994 only), which displayed speed in MPH or KM/H, turn signals, and various warning lights on a unique mirrored patch made into the windshield. The 1989 to 1994 Maxima and 240SX had similar technology but only showed speed. Other features included a coin holder {{built into the}} <b>fuse</b> <b>panel</b> cover (1993 and 1994 only), adjustable lumbar support on the front seats, automatic digital climate control, keyless entry with alarm (optional), floor mats, color matched side mirrors, cornering lights, sunroof, and a higher-powered six-speaker cassette/CD stereo which included 6X9 rear speakers with black metal [...] "active speaker" [...] grilles, metal color matched [...] "active speaker" [...] grilles {{for the front door}} speakers (1993 and 1994 only), and a pair of A pillar tweeters all powered by two factory amps mounted underneath the rear deck. For 1997 it gave up all of the above in exchange for standard leather (previously optional). All SE and GLE models had alloy wheels and variable intermittent wipers.|$|E

50|$|The model {{received}} a minor facelift in 2002. The plastic rear window {{was replaced by}} a smaller glass window. The interior {{received a}} glove compartment, new electro-mechanical hood and trunk release mechanism (with an electronic emergency release in the <b>fuse</b> box <b>panel)</b> and an updated steering wheel. Porsche installed a reworked exhaust pipe and air intake. In addition, the front headlight's amber indicators were replaced with clear indicators. The rear light cluster was also changed with translucent grey turn signals replacing the amber ones. The side marker lights on the front wings were changed as well from amber to clear, except on American market cars where they remained amber. The bumpers were also changed slightly for a more defined, chiselled appearance, and new wheel designs were made available.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the <b>fused</b> plywood <b>panels</b> behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|R
5000|$|This however, {{turns out}} to be part of Michael's plan, as he assumed that T-Bag would {{double-cross}} them. With the alarms off, he burns through a locked door with a blowtorch. However, the electronic lock on the next door does not open with the device Michael brought. He needs to cause a power surge from a <b>fuse</b> <b>panel</b> to unlock the door, so he instructs Sara to leave him behind. Sara refuses to leave if Michael cannot go with her, but he emphasizes that there is no other way, touching her stomach and saying that he will be going with her. In one final act of sacrifice, Michael causes the surge, and sparks are shown coming from the fuse box. Sara runs, meeting Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone just outside the fence. Stunned, Sara is unable to describe to Lincoln what just happened. Mahone revealed that he knew of Michael's plan from a previous discussion and tells Lincoln, [...] "He's gone." [...] They get into the van and drive away, still shocked over Michael's fate.|$|E
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or <b>fuse</b> <b>panel</b> could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|E
5000|$|Phoebe and Piper {{are seen}} {{playing with the}} spirit board. As Piper goes into the kitchen, the pointer on the spirit board starts to spell a word. Phoebe freaks out and calls in Piper and then Prue {{to see what the}} pointer is doing but it doesn't move while all three are watching. She tries to {{convince}} both sisters that the pointer is moving and making out a word, but they do not believe her since Phoebe is known to have moved the pointer in the past. Piper then sees the pointer move briefly and then the spirit board finally spells out the word [...] "attic" [...] as Phoebe writes it down on paper. As the storm continues, the power goes out. Piper and Prue head off to the <b>fuse</b> <b>panel,</b> but Phoebe follows the spirit board's prompt and heads to the attic. The door is locked but suddenly opens and Phoebe is guided to a wooden chest. Opening the chest, she discovers a large, ancient book called the Book of Shadows. Unaware of the powers involved, but overcome with curiosity, she reads a page aloud, which mentions three sisters and the power of three having the active powers of an ancestor named Melinda Warren. The spell bestows Phoebe with premonitions, Piper with molecular immobilization, and Prue with telekinesis. Prue tells Phoebe that the book is of witchcraft but they believe that nothing has changed. In fact, the photo of the three sisters has changed, as they have magically moved closer to each other, but the sisters don't see it. In the morning Prue is confronted by her ex Roger, who is also her boss. He removes her from the project that she had been looking after. Prue quits her job but her anger unwittingly causes her to make his pen explode and his necktie to nearly strangle him. Piper runs out of time and can't complete her dish until she accidentally freezes the chef of the restaurant which allows her to finish the sauce off and get the job. Whilst Phoebe is riding her bike, she gets a premonition of two boys on roller skates being involved in a car accident and she prevents the accident by causing herself to have an accident.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} new inference {{methods for}} counterfactual and synthetic control methods for evaluating policy effects. Our inference methods work {{in conjunction with}} many modern and classical methods for estimating the counterfactual mean outcome {{in the absence of}} a policy intervention. Specifically, our methods work together with the difference-in-difference, canonical synthetic control, constrained and penalized regression methods for synthetic control, factor/matrix completion models for panel data, interactive fixed effects panel models, time series models, as well as <b>fused</b> time series <b>panel</b> data models. The proposed method has a double justification. (i) If the residuals from estimating the counterfactuals are exchangeable as implied, for example, by i. i. d. data, our procedure achieves exact finite sample size control without any assumption on the specific approach used to estimate the counterfactuals. (ii) If the data exhibit dynamics and serial dependence, our inference procedure achieves approximate uniform size control under weak and easy-to-verify conditions on the method used to estimate the counterfactual. We verify these condition for representative methods from each group listed above. Simulation experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in finite samples. We apply our method to re-evaluate the causal effect of election day registration (EDR) laws on voter turnout in the United States...|$|R
40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs), {{a class of}} amorphous metals defined as having a thickness greater than 1 mm, are being broadly investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft hardware. Their unique properties, attained from their non-crystalline structure, motivate several game-changing aerospace applications. BMGs have low melting temperatures {{so they can be}} cheaply and repeatedly cast into complex net shapes, such as mirrors or electronic casings. They are extremely strong and wear-resistant, which motivates their use in gears and bearings. Amorphous metal coatings are hard, corrosion-resistant, and have high reflectivity. BMG composites, reinforced with soft second phases, can be fabricated into energy-absorbing cellular panels for orbital debris shielding. One limitation of BMG materials is their inability to be welded, bonded, brazed, or fastened in a convenient method to form larger structures. Cellular structures (which can be classified as trusses, foams, honeycombs, egg boxes, etc.) are useful for many NASA, commercial, and military aerospace applications, including low-density paneling and shields. Although conventional cellular structures exhibit high specific strength, their porous structures make them challenging to fabricate. In particular, metal cellular structures are extremely difficult to fabricate due to their high processing temperatures. Aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, for example, are used widely as spacecraft shields due to their low density and ease of fabrication, but suffer from low strength. A desirable metal cellular structure is one with high strength, combined with low density and simple fabrication. The thermoplastic joining process described here allows for the fabrication of monolithic BMG truss-like structures that are 90 % porous and have no heat-affected zone, weld, bond, or braze. This is accomplished by welding the nodes of stacked BMG composite panels using a localized capacitor discharge, forming a single monolithic structure. This removes many complicated and costly fabrication steps. Moreover, the cellular structures detailed in this work are among the highest- strength and most energy-absorbent materials known. This implies that a fabricated structure made from these materials would have unequaled mechanical properties compared to other metal foams or trusses. The process works by taking advantage of the electrical properties of the matrix material in the metal-matrix composite, which in this case is a metallic glass. Due to the random nanoscale arrangement of atoms (without any grain boundaries), the matrix glass exhibits a near-constant electrical resistivity as a function of temperature. By placing the composite panels between two copper electrode plates and discharging a capacitor, the entire matrix of the panel can be heated to approximately 700 C in 10 milliseconds, which is above the alloy s solidus but below the liquidus. By designing the geometry of the panels into the shape of an egg box, the electrical discharge localizes only in the tips of each pyramidal cell. By applying a forging load during discharge, the nodes of the <b>panels</b> can be <b>fused</b> together into a single piece, which then dissipates heat through radiation back into a glassy state. This means that two panels can be metallurgically <b>fused</b> into one <b>panel</b> with no heat-affected zone, creating a seamless connection between panels. During the process, the soft metal particles (dendrites) that are uniformly distributed in the glassy matrix to increase the toughness are completely unaffected by the thermoplastic joining. The novelty is that a truss (or foam-like) structure can be formed with excellent energy- absorbing capabilities without the need for machining. The technique allows for large-scale fabrication of panels, well-suited for spacecraft shields or military vehicle door panels. Crystalline metal cellular structures cannot be fabricated using the thermoplastic joining technique described here. If metal panels were te assembled into a cellular structure, they would either have to be welded, brazed, bonded, or fastened together, creating a weak spot in the structure at each connection. Welded parts require a welding material {{to be added to the}} joint and exhibit a soft and weak heat-affected zone. Brazing and bonding do not form a metallurgical joint and thus exhibit low strengths, especially when the panels are pulled apart and fasteners require high-stress-concentration holes to be drilled. No equivalent rapid heating method exists for assembling metal panels together into cellular structures, and thus, those parts must be foamed, machined, or investment cast if they are to form a monolithic structure. If the crystalline panels were to be joined using capacitive discharge, as with a spot welder, their bond would be very weak, and the panels would have to be extremely thin. In contrast, the strength of joined BMG parts has been demonstrated to have strength comparable to the parent material. This technique opens up the possibility of using large-scale BMG hardware in spacecraft, military, or commercial applications...|$|R
