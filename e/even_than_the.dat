By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected. Pluto's mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller <b>even</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Earth's Moon, although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate.

500|$|According to Taraborrelli, the {{defining}} moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely {{death of her}} beloved mother. Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna {{at a time when}} her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that [...] "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them." [...] Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important <b>even</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> death of her mother: [...] "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected.

500|$|The Moon's axial tilt {{with respect}} to the {{ecliptic}} is only 1.5424°, much less than the 23.44° of Earth. Because of this, the Moon's solar illumination varies much less with season, and topographical details {{play a crucial role in}} seasonal effects. From images taken by Clementine in 1994, it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary Crater at the Moon's north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day, creating peaks of eternal light. No such regions exist at the south pole. Similarly, there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters, and these dark craters are extremely cold: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at [...] and just [...] close to the winter solstice in north polar Hermite Crater. This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder <b>even</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> surface of Pluto. Average temperatures of the Moon's surface are reported, but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow.|$|E
