5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{particularly}} high, these mountains are rugged {{and should not}} be underestimated. Severe weather conditions in the North Shore Mountains often contrast dramatically with mild conditions in nearby Vancouver. This is especially true in winter, but even in summer, large precipices are hidden very close to popular hiking trails and it is very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost,</b> despite being in sight of the city. Those who venture into the North Shore Mountains for whatever reason should be well prepared at any time of year.|$|E
500|$|The area is {{exceptionally}} flat by Norwegian standards. It {{consists of}} large rolling hills with forest, shallow lakes and numerous tarns. The land {{is covered in}} an old-growth forest of Scots Pine, intertwined with bog. The park rises slightly towards the west. The climate is dry, with an average [...] precipitation per year. The winters are cold, [...] having been measured. There are 60 days of midnight sun per year. Because of the flat terrain, which is only broken by a few hills, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in the park; lakes and creeks are the easiest means of orientation.

It was miles in extent, and was a tangled wilderness of narrow and lofty clefts and passages. It was an <b>easy</b> place <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in; anybody could do it--including the bats.

500|$|The {{series was}} met with many {{positive}} reviews. Reviewers praised the series' vibrant graphics, high-quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect {{despite the fact that}} the original two games were limited to the 32-bit cartridge. GamePro raved that Golden Sun was [...] "A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't seem to care that it's 'just' on a GBA," [...] while they praised that The Lost Ages eye-popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards. IGN, meanwhile, praised the plot's intricate structure, saying that it [...] "has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of the adventure... such a rich and deep plot that it's almost <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> if you're not paying attention." [...] 1UP praised Dark Dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to the previous games.|$|E
500|$|Touch Arcade {{called the}} {{graphics}} [...] "good, but not great", though reasonable given the game's age, but that some demon designs were [...] "spectacular works of art". RPGFan found {{the majority of}} the game's graphics to be [...] "functional, but not too appealing", and said that it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> due to the bland textures of the walls and the floors. They did however like the graphics used in battles and story sections, which they found well-drawn and detailed. They praised the designs of the game's female characters, especially Nekomata, Lamia, and Yuriko, but felt that the designs of the male characters were bland. Touch Arcade found the music to be fantastic. RPGFan said that every piece fits into the scene where it is played, but that few were memorable. They did note [...] "Ginza" [...] as an exception, which they felt was so well-composed that it would sound good in any format.|$|E

[...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E

5000|$|Overgrown {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 82, based on 40 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Martyn Young of musicOMH stated that [...] "Overgrown is more diverse and dynamic than before. Blake {{seems to have}} found an ideal middle ground between restrained and measured balladry and disorientating electronic soul". This sentiment was echoed by The Guardians Paul MacInnes, who wrote that [...] "Blake's palette is unique, his abilities as a composer are great and quite obviously growing." [...] In a review for AllMusic, Fred Thomas described the album as existing [...] "somewhere between the vacant echoes of dub and trip-hop, dubstep's sample-slicing production, and the contained heartbreak of a singer/songwriter playing piano to himself in an empty room," [...] and noted that [...] "while it might take listeners a few spins {{to find the right}} head space for the album, once they get there, it's an <b>easy</b> place <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in." [...] Clash said the album is [...] "paradoxically less fragmented than its illustrious predecessor, ideas rotating core values guided by an affirmatively unseen hand. Which ultimately makes this an even better record." ...|$|R
500|$|Lars Brandle (Billboard) {{reviewed}} the {{concert at the}} BBEC Great Hall in Brisbane. Brandle predominantly noted the band's popularity: [...] "To say [...] is the hottest boy-band on the scene, doesn't quite grasp the situation. [...] "On fire" [...] {{is closer to the}} mark." [...] Brandle commended the show for being [...] "all slick, clean fun". Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal." [...] Futterman highlighted their acoustic performances, which [...] "showed off Horan's ability to play guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals".Futterman concluded that there [...] "was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show". Jane Stevenson (Canoe.ca) maintained that the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto had [...] "none of that choreographed dance move nonsense", and complimented the [...] "naturally, classy, low-key" [...] production. Melody Lau (National Post) {{reviewed the}} same concert. Lau opined, [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Lau additionally noted One Direction's lack of original material to perform, [...] "the group falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' [...] "Stereo Hearts" [...] and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's [...] "Torn". Not straying too far away from the originals, the mid-show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn't mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{capture of}} the redoubt was {{considered}} by some German officers to be a worse blow to morale than the fall of Thiepval. The 28th Reserve Division positions in the Ancre valley were exposed to British ground observation and made Grandcourt a deathtrap. The trenches were demolished and movement had to be from shell-hole to shell-hole; it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> and blunder into British positions. Ludendorff and Rupprecht considered a retirement from the salient that had formed around St Pierre Division and Beaumont Hamel as the Germans had been pushed off {{the west end of}} Bazentin Ridge. Below objected because there were no better positions to retire to and preferred to counter-attack to regain Feste Staufen and the positions nearby. In 2005, Prior and Wilson wrote that the attack on the Mounds succeeded because of detailed preparation, the attacking units being fresh, despite the bad weather and resting battalions being used for digging and carrying. The artillery preparation was considered excellent and the assembly for the attack was so well covered by the bombardment, that the attack was a tactical surprise. The infantry were more experienced, keeping close to the creeping barrage and the German artillery-fire was judged to have been feeble. In 2009, Philpott wrote that it had taken the Reserve Army/5th Army more than a month to capture {{the north end of the}} Thiepval Ridge against a reinvigorated German defence. The advance was costly and the front line had been moved barely [...] forward.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to The Man from London generally praised its formalist aesthetic and painstakingly composed scenes, while criticizing its slow pace {{and lack of}} a compelling plot. Most argued the film fell short of Tarr's previous efforts. Varietys Derek Elley rated the film {{on a par with}} his Damnation (1988) but as inferior to Sátántangó (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000), remarking it was improbable that The Man From London would {{put an end to the}} polarization of Tarr's audiences into those who hail him as a director of [...] "visionary genius" [...] and those for whom he is a [...] "crashing bore". Martin Tsai of The New York Sun allowed that Tarr [...] "makes it <b>easy</b> for viewers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> in his beautifully bleak world and lose track of time" [...] but complained that in comparison with its predecessors, the film's central theme of guilt seemed insubstantial and the film itself felt [...] "slight and incomplete".|$|R
500|$|In its review, Famitsu {{compared}} the 3D dungeon {{exploration of the}} Atlus version to the Deep Dungeon series, with the critics giving praise to its gameplay and unusual setting. In {{an article about the}} game in 1991, Family Computer Magazine called it a [...] "revolutionary RPG", praising its gameplay and atmosphere despite the design making it <b>easy</b> for players <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost.</b> Ohta Publishing magazine Continue cited its dark atmosphere and mechanics as both impressive given the limited hardware and innovative among role-playing games of the time. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 stated that it was [...] "surprising how in depth the monster catching and fusing elements are given the game's age", praising its mechanics despite the age and high difficult curve. In contrast to their praise for the Famicom version, they referred to Telenet Japan's version as a poor clone of Gauntlet with low-quality graphics. While no specific sales figures are available, Okada said that the game was a commercial success, allowing Atlus breathing room to consider where to next take the series.|$|R
500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing it for themselves can actually make more money than the massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't know we have a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's <b>easy</b> for music <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|R

In this research, the design of the system to identify or recognize a person using biometrics, especially the hand using Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection and Contour Extraction was carried out. The identification system with biometrics has many advantages because it is always attached to the body and can not be separated with humans. Stages performed in image processing in the form of RGB image conversion into binary using threshodling, edge detection using Laplacian of Gaussian as well as contour extraction using chain code representation. The result of contour extraction is the number of pixels calculated on each segment of the finger divided into 8 sections. The matching process on the system is done by using euclidean distance, ie calculate the smallest distance of similarity between the test image and the database. The result of identification conducted in this research using the feature extraction method, obtained accuracy of 93. 33...|$|R
