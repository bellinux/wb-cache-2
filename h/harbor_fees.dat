In this he sent a cargo of sandal-wood to [...] Canton, having discovered that the foreign merchants trading [...] with him made large profits on this wood, shipped by them [...] from the islands to the Chinese markets. The ship was manned [...] by natives, but the officers were Englishmen. She [...] accomplished her voyage, and returned in safety to the [...] islands, with the Hawaiian flag floating gloriously in the [...] breeze. The king hastened on board, expecting to find his [...] sandal-wood converted into crapes and damasks, and other [...] rich stuffs of China, but found, to his astonishment, by the [...] legerdemain of traffic, his cargo had all disappeared, and, [...] in place of it, remained a bill of charges amounting to [...] three thousand dollars. It was some time before he could be [...] made to comprehend certain {{of the most important}} items of [...] the bill, such as pilotage, anchorage, and custom-house [...] fees; but when he discovered that maritime states in other [...] countries derived large revenues in this manner, to the [...] great cost of the merchant, [...] "Well," [...] cried he, [...] "then I will [...] have <b>harbor</b> <b>fees</b> also." [...] He established them accordingly. [...] Pilotage a dollar a foot on the draft of each vessel. [...] Anchorage from sixty to seventy dollars. In this way he [...] greatly increased the royal revenue, and turned his China [...] speculation to account.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the earthquake, Rhodes was an Aegean port city which was famous for the large bronze statue that stood near its harbor. It was one of the major trading cities of the Mediterranean Sea, along with the city of Alexandria in Egypt. As {{evidenced}} by the taxes the city received in <b>harbor</b> <b>fees,</b> the amount of trade that passed through it was tremendous. Having survived threats from larger neighbors, the city had gained the respect of the Mediterranean world. The statue, known as the Colossus, had been built before 250 BC to give thanks to the gods for delivering the city safely from a Macedonian siege. Some historical images have shown the Colossus as actually straddling the harbor entrance, a feat which would have been impossible given the bronze-casting technology of the time.|$|E

S. foreign trade and a bulwark for national security. One way the federal government funds port-related programs is to levy user fees. GAO was asked to examine (1) {{what is known about}} the way selected fees assessed on air and sea port users are set, collected, used, and reviewed and (2) the effects of these attributes on program operations. GAO examined the <b>Harbor</b> Maintenance <b>Fee</b> (HMF), the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF), and the Customs, Immigration, and Agricultural Quarantine Inspection (AQI) user fees assessed on air and cruise passengers and commercial vessels using criteria that have often been used to assess user fees and taxes [...] equity, efficiency, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden. ...|$|R
40|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 {{required}} the DOE to develop recommendations and implement government programs {{to assist the}} domestic uranium industry in increasing export opportunities. In 1993, {{as part of that}} effort, the Office of Nuclear Energy identified several key factors that could (or have) significantly impact(ed) export opportunities for domestic uranium. This report addresses one of these factors: regulatory and policy impediments to the flow of uranium products between the US and other countries. It speaks primarily to the uranium market for civil nuclear power. Changes in the world political and economic order have changed US national security requirements, and the US uranium industry has found itself without the protected market it once enjoyed. An unlevel playing field for US uranium producers has resulted from a combination of geology, history, and a general US political philosophy of nonintervention that precludes the type of industrial policy practiced in other uranium-exporting countries. The US has also been hampered in its efforts to support the domestic uranium-producing industry by its own commitment to free and open global markets and by international agreements such as GATT and NAFTA. Several US policies, including the imposition of NRC fees and licensing costs and <b>Harbor</b> Maintenance <b>fees,</b> directly harm the competitiveness of the domestic uranium industry. Finally, requirements under US law, such as those in the 1979 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, place very strict limits on the use of US-origin uranium, limitations not imposed by other uranium-producing countries. Export promotion and coordination are two areas in which the US can help the domestic uranium industry without violating existing trade agreements or other legal or policy constraints...|$|R
