40|$|In this M. Sc. thesis {{organisational}} {{and technical}} aspects {{related to the}} implementation of an Opportunity Based Maintenance (OBM) scheme for Oil and Gas facilities have been discussed. Organisational aspects of importance include agility and resilience. Agility can be understood as the ability of organisation to benefit from unexpected events. Resilience can be understood as damage control. Logistics support elements from the space industry can also be beneficial to implement in the logistics support of Oil and Gas facilities. Elements from the space industry include the implementation of Onshore Support Centre (OSC), prepositioning of spares and tools and standard procedures for critical equipment. A simplified oil and gas production system {{has been used as a}} basis for a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), identifying critical components that should be considered for Condition Monitoring (CM). The results of the FMECA were that centrifugal compressors and shell and tube heat exchangers were ranked as critical equipment. Gate valves were also ranked as critical but have been neglected in the further analysis due to heat exchangers and compressors being more critical. Several different CM methods have been described, emphasis have been put on detection method, application and words of warning when implementing the method. CM methods relevant to the critical equipment have also been discussed. For compressors the most relevant CM methods includes Vibration monitoring, Power and Load monitoring. In addition to these general methods special software applications are also available through different distributors. For monitoring heat exchangers internal inspection is most commonly used. The inspection interval can be determined by a Risk Based Inspection (RBI) scheme. When an inspection is due Eddy Current Testing (ECT) or gas leak tests can be used to determine diminishing pipe thickness in the tube section of the heat exchanger. HXAM supplied by ABB is also an interesting solution offering real time measurement of the performance of the heat exchangers. Lastly how logistics planning is related to maintenance of oil and gas facilities today have been discussed. How a shift to OBM will impact the logistics planning have also been discussed. Means that can reduce any negative impact that a shift to OBM may have has also been discussed. One such measure is the investment in a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Also lessons that can be learnt from the logistics support in the space industry have been emphasised again. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{emerging}} automation technologies for pallet handling in multi pallet-deep rack storage systems. In particular, this study investigates opportunities {{resulting from the}} adoption of pallet shuttles (PSs) for material handling within the rack structure, i. e. for put-away and retrieval operations from the rack face to the specific pallet location and viceversa. PSs {{may be used in}} combination with both manually-driven forklift trucks and Laser Guided Vehicles (LGVs) providing material transport from the end-of-line area to the rack storage and from the rack storage to the loading area. The focus of this study is on the combined use of PSs and LGVs so as to discuss the design of a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>warehouse.</b> PSs help to overcome the disadvantages related {{to one of the most}} commonly used and space efficient type of racks storage, i. e. drive-in racks or similar solutions. Pallets stored in drive-in racks are not independently accessible so that all the levels of a certain lane must be devoted to the same item type and the amount of time to access the pallet locations increases as the lane depth and the number of levels increase. This may lead to efficiency losses. On the contrary, PSs allow different item types to be stored in independent levels of the same lane, so that an higher storage efficiency can be obtained even in long racks. It should be pointed out that methods to support the design of a full automated logistics system are still in an early stage of development. In particular, to the authors' knowledge, studies about the joint design of LGV and PS fleets are not proposed in literature. Thus, this study aims to develop an analytical model for the integrated dimensioning of the fleet of PSs and the fleet of LGVs in a storage system. Given a fleet of PSs acting as the server of the system, the proposed model provides the pallet shuttle utilization rate as a function of the number of LGVs, by taking into consideration the storage area layout and the production and delivery flows. The model identifies sets of feasible solutions, expressed in terms of number of LGVs and PSs, with the same PS utilization rate, i. e. that can be represented by iso-utilization contour lines. Finally, through the application of queuing theory results, the PS utilization rate of a certain set of solutions can be related to the expected cycle time (order release to shipment). The validity of the model is proved by discussing a real case study...|$|E
40|$|Despite several {{developments}} in logistics that strive to decrease costs, tendencies {{can be found}} for increased logistical costs (Pewe, 2011, p. 17). Some factors causing increased system complexity are increased selection and faster market movements. The Warehouse Department at Carlsberg Sverige in Falkenberg has been chosen to be studied regarding continuous quality improvements. Carlsberg Sverige implemented an automated inventory system and automated order-picking system in 2012 - 2013, which has had about 40 % increase of stock keeping units (SKUs) since the investments. Since {{the implementation of the}} automation Carlsberg Sverige has encountered challenges with other quality of goods. The system has become more sensitive and it has become more important to eliminate deviation. The study aimed to develop a way for long-term reduction or elimination of quality errors that result in negative effects to the system. A specific area investigated was regarding both effect of the organization in a holistic perspective and on a level of detail of the analyzed area. The study did not include quality of beverages, but only external quality problems of goods, such as faulty stacking of packages or plastic wrapping hanging outside of the goods. An exploratory study was conducted with predominantly quantitative data collection methods. Initially a current state mapping was made, a flow chart was created through interviews and observations of employees. Critical activities / situations were identified in the flow chart and three areas were determined for further investigation regarding quality errors. Observations were carried out where all occurred abnormalities were registered. The results were analyzed and a focus area determined for continued deeper examination. A final model was created with the influence of theories and collected data from the case study. The examined focus area was part of the <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Adaptation to the new automation was still under investigation and a need for more clarity in the continuous quality improvements. From the observations, it was revealed that in approximately 70 % of the observing time in the focus area, there was an error in the area affected system. Registered errors were categorized into ten groups, seven groups were included in the research scope. Out of the seven categories there were two significance regarding amount of repetitions of registered errors; unreadable label was measured 30 times, and plastic wrapping outside goods was discovered 12 times during 7 hours of measurement. Significance regarding average duration was discovered for; system errors of labels and wood detected by sensors on conveyors. Detected errors with significance were further analyzed with fishbone diagrams to find root-causes. Several common causes were discovered in the fishbone diagrams, for instance regarding inadequate methods and measurements. The discoveries functioned as basis for the final model that consists of: Key Performance Indexes (KPI's), a flow chart of affecting processes, daily whiteboard meetings, improved communication channels and a process for implementation of routines. The model developed was to fit this case study, which represents; a complex system with lots of shift work, both manual and automated processes and handling of beverage goods. Despite this, the model is considered to function as a basis to work on continuous quality improvements for organizations outside the mentioned scope, but with modifications of the model...|$|E
