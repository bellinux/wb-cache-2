5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

500|$|Between {{seasons of}} Richard, in 1934 Gielgud {{returned}} to Hamlet in London and on tour, directing {{and playing the}} title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In The New York Times, Charles Morgan wrote, [...] "I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined.... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> a better performance of this play than this before I die, {{it will be a}} miracle." [...] Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night [...] "to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time." ...|$|E

500|$|Tamara Coniff of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the verses of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] resemble those of Aretha Franklin's songs. Tom Breihan commented that Knowles [...] " [...] with force and purpose on the verses". As the song opens, she tells her lover, [...] "I can't let you go", and that she will not allow another woman to take everything she owns, including the chinchilla coats and {{the house on the}} coast. Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll be damned <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E

2500|$|Because of Fitzpatrick's {{desire for}} the {{photograph}} to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed [...] "F" [...] on the shoulder. It {{was not until the}} 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating [...] "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone." [...] At this time Fitzpatrick said that [...] "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine." [...] In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that [...] "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." [...] Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.|$|E
2500|$|Marriage {{played a}} large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, [...] "To My Dear And Loving Husband," [...] she reveals that she is one with her husband. [...] "If ever two were one, then surely we." [...] The Puritans {{believed}} that since marriage is ordained by God, then it is a gift from God. [...] She loves her gift so much that through the use of her poetry, she is able to express her love for God's gift to her husband. In another of Bradstreet's works, [...] "Before the Birth of One of Her Children", Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage. In the lines, [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> not half my days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you;" [...] Bradstreet is saying that if she was to die soon, what would God give her husband. She could be referring to him possibly remarrying after she dies. [...] Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, [...] "These O protect from stepdame's injury", Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future step mother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband with a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage and how God provided them with this gift.|$|E
2500|$|Fang Xuanling {{had served}} Your Imperial Majesty {{for a long}} time. [...] He is careful, {{and all of his}} {{wonderful}} strategies and secret plans were not revealed to anyone. [...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting. [...] Even as I go into the underworld, if these things happen, I will have no regrets. [...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> them mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
