25|$|This {{is because}} one can always {{reduce the number}} of {{variables}} by substituting zero for some variables, and one can increase the number of variables by applying the homomorphisms n; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that n(P(X1,,X'n))=P(X1,,X'n+1) (and similarly for Q) whenever n'd.

The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings.

25|$|Because of the Internet's {{ability to}} rapidly convey {{large amounts of}} {{information}} throughout the world, the use of collective intelligence to predict stock prices and stock price direction has become increasingly viable.

The opinion of all investor can be weighed equally so that a pivotal premise of the <b>effective</b> <b>application</b> of collective intelligence can be applied: the masses, including {{a broad spectrum of}} stock market expertise, can be utilized to more accurately predict the behavior of financial markets.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} {{humanitarian}} intervention {{in international affairs}} is varied. As discussed above, humanitarian intervention is a contentious issue. Examples of humanitarian intervention illustrate, {{that in some cases}} intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in Srebrenica and Somalia. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the Rwandan genocide. One example is of a successful humanitarian intervention and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian intervention but also an <b>effective</b> <b>application</b> of human security principles.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} hypothesized the PRC {{backed down}} {{in the face of}} American nuclear brinksmanship and in light of the lack of willingness by the Soviet Union to threaten nuclear retaliation for an attack on the PRC. Others see the case as an example of <b>effective</b> <b>application</b> of extended deterrence by the United States. In any case, the Red Chinese government stated on April 23, 1955, that it was willing to negotiate. On May 1 the PLA temporarily ceased shelling Kinmen and Matsu. The fundamental issues of the conflict remained unresolved, however, and both sides subsequently built up their military forces on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait leading to a new crisis three years later. There are strong indications that Mao used the crisis in order to provoke the United States into making nuclear threats. Other scholars have argued that Mao and the Soviet leadership carefully pursued a limited aims strategy to boost morale and for domestic political gain by seizing the Dachens and had no intention to escalate the conflict with the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The IMCB {{publicly}} condemned Union Carbide and {{reiterated the}} company's full liability {{not only for}} responsibility in causing the deadly gas leak, {{but also for the}} confounding role of its behaviour with respect to pre-accident preventive and exposure mitigating efforts, and the timely and <b>effective</b> <b>application</b> of the appropriate medical measures {{at the time of the}} accident. This included the lack of transparency about the composition of the gases released, resulting in the absence of rational methods of care and planning resulting in loss of sight and in some cases life, and creation of suspicion and conflict among professionals and the population. [...] There was also a lack of emergency preparation which would have made the public and professionals aware of the potential toxins inside the plant and how to respond to an accident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{recovery}} system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was incorporated into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an electrical device known as a heat motor generator unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic motor generator unit. This device was connected directly to the drive train to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way. In combination with the ERS-K it gave drivers an additional [...] for thirty-three seconds per lap, compared to the KERS units used prior to 2014, which gave drivers [...] for six seconds per lap. This energy was released into the powertrain by the electronic control unit (ECU) to promote the most efficient and <b>effective</b> <b>application</b> of the power, but the driver had the ability to manually override the ECU and use the remaining available power instantly.|$|E
