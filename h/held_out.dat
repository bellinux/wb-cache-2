5|$|At Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Buckner {{had become}} the first Confederate general of the war to {{surrender}} an army; at New Orleans, he became the last. The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2, (Only Brigadier General Stand Watie <b>held</b> <b>out</b> longer; he surrendered the last Confederate land forces on June 23, 1865).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, {{as he had}} free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still <b>held</b> <b>out</b> under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.|$|E
5|$|Before spring {{training}} in 2009, there was speculation that if Garko {{did not perform}} well, he might lose his starting first base job. Garko began practicing the outfield position for the upcoming season. Eric Wedge stated that Garko would in fact be playing the outfield in {{spring training}}. On June 21, Garko was <b>held</b> <b>out</b> of the game because of a sprained left wrist.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are <b>held</b> <b>out</b> and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Ellis <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{from the}} Pirates in February 1968; {{he came to}} terms with the team in March. The Pirates optioned Ellis to Columbus, who moved Ellis from the {{starting}} rotation to the bullpen. At Columbus, Ellis credited his work with manager Johnny Pesky and pitching coach Harvey Haddix for improving his performance.|$|E
5|$|Hostilities did not {{end with}} the {{publication}} of the Dictum. The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given, and <b>held</b> <b>out</b> until 14 December, when deprivation forced them to surrender. In April 1267, the earl of Gloucesterwho had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to the drafting of the Dictumturned against the king. He occupied the city of London, and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited. After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono, Gloucester relented, and by June a settlement was reached. Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum, whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after; an arrangement that made repayment much easier. In the summer of that year, Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely, where the last of the rebels still <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> and forced them into submission under terms favourable to the rebels.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, Millett was {{involved}} in a dispute with the New York City authorities, who wanted to evict her from her home at 295 Bowery as part of a massive redevelopment plan. Millett and other tenants <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> but ultimately lost their battle. Their building was demolished, and the residents were relocated.|$|E
5|$|Khe Sanh {{received}} 18,000 tons of aerial resupplies {{during the}} 77-day battle, whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at Điện Biên Phủ <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> they received only 4,000 tons. Also, the US Air Force dropped 114,810 tons of bombs upon the Vietnamese at Khe Sanh – roughly {{as many as}} on Japan during 1945 during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gythium {{was fought}} in 195 BC between Sparta and the {{coalition}} of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{but one of the}} joint commanders, Dexagoridas, decided to surrender the city to the Roman legate. When Gorgopas, the other commander, found out, he killed Dexagoridas and took solo command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder the Spartans <b>held</b> <b>out</b> more vigorously. However, Titus Quinctius Flamininus of the allied forces arrived with 4,000 more men and the Spartans decided to surrender the city on the condition that the garrison could leave unharmed. The result of this battle forced Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, to abandon the surrounding land and withdraw to the city of Sparta. Later that year, Sparta capitulated to the allies.|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans met stiff {{resistance}} at Kőszeg. Suleiman {{had hoped}} that the imperial army would come to relieve Kőszeg, affording him {{an opportunity for a}} larger engagement. However, during the Ottoman attacks on Kőszeg, the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg. The Ottomans continued with one attack after another; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls, but brought no surrender. The Ottomans' mines were sapped by countermines. The layout of Kőszeg's walls made mining a feasible strategy, but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications, the defenders <b>held</b> <b>out.</b> For more than twenty-five days, without any artillery, Captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 700 local Hungarian peasants and a few Croat soldier <b>held</b> <b>out</b> against nineteen full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The understrength Turkish {{battalion}} {{entrusted with}} its defence doggedly <b>held</b> <b>out</b> with great courage {{and in so}} doing fulfilled its obligation. They held up two English cavalry divisions for six hours and had prevented them from expanding their outflanking manoeuvres around the Beersheba-Hebron road.|$|E
5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi <b>held</b> <b>out</b> longer. They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

5|$|Alston's Dodgers {{teams of}} the 1960s {{benefited from the}} strong {{pitching}} by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players <b>held</b> <b>out</b> of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season {{on the advice of}} doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor <b>held</b> <b>out</b> of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, the day {{had been}} quiet. When the {{commander}} of the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpić sent a truck-mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. The platoon was ambushed en route, with 14 Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of 26 June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, but <b>held</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty <b>held</b> <b>out</b> of {{renewing}} {{their contracts}} with the team. Other {{members of the team}} had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, Flick and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick's help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still <b>held</b> <b>out</b> against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was {{generally considered to be}} both just and fair.|$|E
