As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative level of information asymmetry, {{defined as the}} differing ability of insiders and outsiders to accurately value a firm, for property-liability firms compared to non-insurance firms. Although the literature often argues that the propertyliability insurance industry exhibits relatively high levels of information asymmetry, no previous empirical work directly tests this assertion. Using a measure of information asymmetry derived from the market microstructure literature, we find evidence consistent with property-liability insurers exhibiting greater levels of <b>information</b> asymmetry <b>than</b> noninsurance firms in general. Further, we find evidence that property-liability insurers exhibit greater levels of <b>information</b> asymmetry <b>than</b> several other specific industries, with no industry category exhibiting greater levels of <b>information</b> asymmetry <b>than</b> the propertyliability insurance industry. * Corresponding author...|$|R

5|$|At Foulois' recommendation, Saville {{entered the}} Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in August 1933. Saville {{graduated}} in May 1934, {{at the top}} of his class, and remained at the school as an instructor in the Maps and Photographs Section. At ACTS, Saville joined Claire L. Chennault in favoring an air defense strategy hinging on a strong fighter force. Saville argued against the so-called Bomber Mafia; he did not believe that fleets of bombers were unstoppable, and he considered close coordination between ground units and tactical air power a key part of Army doctrine. In July 1935, at the temporary rank of captain, he was named recorder of the Air Corps Board at Maxwell Field, in addition to his duties as fighter aviation instructor. Saville removed a degree of independent command from fighter squadron leaders who previously could ignore instructions radioed from the ground. Backed by Brigadier General Henry Conger Pratt, Saville's unpopular control methods proved their worth, as ground controllers were often in possession of better <b>information</b> <b>than</b> squadron leaders in flight. From 1935 to 1937, as Chennault was eased out by the bomber advocates, Saville took his place as the top fighter proponent. Saville avoided Chennault's fate by refraining from disputing the bomber's important role in offensive operations. He felt that the fighter aircraft was undervalued in its defensive role.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more <b>information</b> <b>than</b> the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
