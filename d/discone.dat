50|$|The <b>discone's</b> {{wideband}} coverage {{makes it}} attractive in commercial, military, amateur radio and radio scanner applications.|$|R
50|$|The <b>discone's</b> {{inherently}} wideband nature permits it {{to broadcast}} undesirable spurious emissions from faulty or improperly filtered transmitters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>discone</b> antenna has {{a useful}} {{frequency}} range {{of at least}} 10 to 1. When employed as a transmitting antenna, it is often less efficient than an antenna designed for a more limited frequency range. SWR (standing wave ratio) is typically 1.5:1 or less over several octaves of frequency. A <b>discone</b> antenna consists of three main parts: the disc, the cone, and the insulator.|$|E
50|$|Various antenna were {{employed}} to obtain maximum range from ship-to-shore. The UHF transceiver used a <b>discone,</b> while the VHF transceivers used ground plane antennas. The 1 kW HF transmitter used a remotely tuned 35 ft whip antenna, while the 3 kW HF transmitter used a vertical cage antenna., and the 10 kW transmitter employed a <b>discone</b> antenna. The vessel contained numerous state-of-the-art receivers, which were fed from an antenna distribution system from three 18 ft whips.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Discone</b> antenna - Omnidirectional, {{vertically}} polarized {{and with}} gain {{similar to a}} dipole, it is exceptionally wideband, offering a frequency range ratio of up to approximately 10:1.|$|E
50|$|A <b>discone</b> antenna is {{a version}} of a {{biconical}} antenna in {{which one of the}} cones is replaced by a disc. It is usually mounted vertically, with the disc at the top and the cone beneath.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{types of}} low-gain {{omnidirectional}} antennas are the whip antenna, [...] "Rubber Ducky" [...] antenna, ground plane antenna, vertically oriented dipole antenna, <b>discone</b> antenna, mast radiator, horizontal loop antenna (sometimes known colloquially as a 'circular aerial' {{because of the}} shape) and the halo antenna.|$|E
50|$|A {{vertical}} whip may be {{affixed to}} the center of the disc in order to extend the low frequency response, but this may compromise efficiency at higher frequencies. In this configuration, at lower frequencies the <b>discone</b> may more closely resemble a ground plane antenna or a coaxial dipole.|$|E
40|$|An Ultra-Wideband (UWB) antenna is {{required}} for UWB communications systems, such as the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). In this case, the desired antenna must cover a bandwidth of 20 MHz to 4 GHz, be omnidirectional, be convenient to transport and deploy, {{and be able to}} transmit 200 Watts of power. Conventional <b>discone</b> antennas are candidates for such systems, but they have insufficient bandwidth for the required application. To improve their bandwidth, we added resistive loading to the conical elements and to the ground plane, and we increased the size of the ground plane. We built several models of the resistively loaded <b>discone,</b> and we observed a dramatic reduction in VSWR when compared to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) <b>discone.</b> We also simulated the antenna pattern using the NEC computer code, and we used the antenna with an amateur radio. The resistively loaded <b>discone</b> has clear advantages for UWB communications when compared to the COTS <b>discone.</b> Table of Content...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Anovel double <b>discone</b> antenna is {{composed}} of the asymmetric biconical antenna and upside-down <b>discone</b> antenna. The asymmetric biconical antenna has all-wire structure like octopus legs for covering at lower operating frequency, and the upside-down <b>discone</b> antenna has conical shape playing a role as covering at higher operating frequency. An elaborate assembly of two antenna exhibits a 1 : 100 impedance band-width (180 MHz– 18 GHz) with VSWR below 2. 5 while maintaining an acceptable omnidirectional radiation pattern except at about 12 GHz region. The simulated performances of the proposed antenna are verified by the measured results of the fabricated antenna. There seems to be good agreement with each other. These features make such antennas highly suitable for application to UWB system. Index Terms—Asymmetric biconical antenna, double <b>discone</b> antenna. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to design a {{dielectric}} covered <b>discone</b> WLAN antenna working under the protocols of IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g/n. It has the wideband operation of <b>discone</b> antennas and the compact dimensions of dielectric resonator antennas which {{is compatible with the}} latest main protocol WLAN applications. This antenna has an ultra-wide bandwidth (2. 25 GHz- 6. 0 GHz), which is sufficient for the data communication protocols of IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g/n (2401 MHz- 2484 MHz and 5150 MHz- 5825 MHz). Its directivity is 3. 1 dBi at the lower frequency band and 5. 3 dBi at the higher frequency band, which is enough to cover conventional indoor usages. In order to use similar radiation patterns at both operational bands the quad slot is added to the disk. The antenna is quite competitive compared to other commercially used antennas because of its wideband potential: it can be is used not only in WLAN applications, but also for other ultra-wideband applications.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports on}} a survey of radio frequency interference (RFI) below 270 MHz. The survey was conducted during business hours {{from the roof of}} the Ohio State University ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL) using a commercially avail-able wideband <b>discone</b> antenna. The resolution of the survey is 30 kHz. Because the RFI at the observing site in this band is very strong, the sensitivity of this survey was sacrificed to ensure that the measurements were reasonably linear and free of self-generated harmonics intermodulation products. Thus, this survey is useful only for identifying strong RFI. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traditional design {{guidelines}} for broadband antennas {{do not always}} produce satisfactory performance for the desired frequency range of interest. In addition, the accurate prediction of the freespace antenna performance {{is not sufficient to}} determine if the antenna will meet a larger system requirement because the performance of the antenna can change significantly when it is installed on a platform. Antenna design software, such as WIPL-D, addresses the difficulties of designing antennas with broadband performance by providing optimization software that can automatically resize the various antenna dimensions until a desired performance criterion is met. At high-frequencies, the electrically large size of the platform makes it computationally difficult, or impossible, to directly consider the interactions between the antenna and the platform when designing the antenna in a full-wave solver. This paper describes an approach for the design and optimization of a <b>discone</b> antenna and then the subsequent installation on a large commercial aircraft. The antenna design will be optimized across a wide frequency range using WIPL-D Optimizer. The resulting <b>discone</b> antenna design is then imported into Savant-Hybrid, a hybrid asymptotic and full-wave solver, and the installed antenna performance is simulated using GPU acceleration at multiple potential antenna locations to determine the location that provides the least-degraded installed antenna performance.

The radiation pattern has been observed for various values of ka signifying all the ranges of operation of the antenna.

A uniformly spaced linearly array of 11 <b>discone</b> antennas was used for the passive radar.

In order to suppress the direct reference signal and clutters, the beamforming and MUSIC algorithms have been applied to the range-Doppler processed data; however, challenges remain due to very low SNR.

A better approach would be to use a dual polarized antenna. In this thesis a dual polarized omnidirectional antenna, with a resonance frequency of 1800 MHz, is presented. It consist of a special kind of loop antenna, the Alford loop, and a <b>discone</b> antenna.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the design of}} two ultra-wideband antennas {{for the application of}} transient field measurements that are characterized by frequency spectra that typically range from a few MHz to several GHz. The motivation for their design is the excitation of high power transient pulses, such as double exponential or damped sinusoidal pulses, within highly resonant metallic enclosures. The antenna design is based on two independent numerical full-wave solvers and it is aimed to achieve a low return loss over a wide range of frequencies together with a high pulse fidelity. It turns out that antennas of the conical and <b>discone</b> type do achieve satisfactory broadband characteristics while limitations towards low frequencies persist. Also the concept of fidelity factor turns out as advantageous to determine whether the proposed antennas allow transmitting certain broadband pulse forms...|$|E

40|$|Multi-static {{transmitter}} {{networks are}} found in the digital broadcast service nets for radio (DAB) and television (DVB-T) with bandwidths ranging from 1. 5 to 7 MHz and transmit powers between 1 and 10 kW. Taking advantage of these transmitter networks for radar purposes combines the covertness of a hardly locatable receiver with the advantageous anti-stealth detection capabilities of the VHF/UHF frequency range and the simultaneous multi-static illumination under different aspect angles. Increased multi-static coverage at low elevations and diffraction propagation add to the detection of low flying objects. Passive, multi-static, low frequency radars are thus expected to have decisive potentials to detect stealth and low flying targets.

We herein report on a series of radioglaciological measurements performed approximately 10 km north of Taylor Dome Station, Antarctica from Dec. 6, 2006 - Dec. 16, 2006. Using RF signals broadcast from: a) an englacial <b>discone,</b> submerged to a depth of 100 meters and broadcasting to a surface dual polarization horn receiver, and b) a dual-polarization horn antenna on the surface transmitting signals which reflect off the underlying bed and back up to the surface receiver, we have made time-domain estimates of both the real (index-of-refraction) and imaginary (attenuation length) components of the complex ice dielectric constant. We have also measured the uniformity of ice response along two orthogonal axes in the horizontal plane. We observe a wavespeed asymmetry of order 0. 1 %, projected onto the vertical propagation axis, consistent with some previous measurements, but somewhat lower than others.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{was developed to}} estimate uncertainties in full two-port Vector Network Analyzer measurements, using total differentials of S-parameters. System error uncertainties were also estimated from total differentials involving two triples of standards, in the Direct Through connection case. Standard load uncertainties and measurement inaccuracies were represented by independent differentials. Complex uncertainty in any quantity, differentiably dependent on S-parameters, is estimated by the corresponding Differential Error Region. Real uncertainties, rectangular and polar, are estimated by the orthogonal parallelogram and annular sector circumscribed about the Differential Error Region, respectively. From the user's point of view, manufactures' data {{may be used to}} set the independent differentials and apply the method. Demonstration results include: (1) System error differentials for Short, matching Load and Open pairs of opposite sex standards; (2) System error uncertainties for VNA extended by two lengthy transmission lines of opposite sex end-connectors; (3) High uncertainties in Z-parameters against frequency of an appropriately designed, DC resistive, T-Network; (4) Moderate uncertainties in amplitude and phase patterns of a designed UHF radial <b>discone</b> antenna (azimuthally rotated by a built positioner, under developed software control of a built hardware controller) polarization coupled with a constructed gain standard antenna (stationary) into an anechoic chamber...|$|E
