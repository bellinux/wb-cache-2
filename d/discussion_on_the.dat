5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} not contesting the election because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals decided {{to do so in}} order to generate a <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous elections for the Liberal Party, was in favour of devolution of powers to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but {{if they did not}} begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possibility of developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted {{it could not be}} done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to the elevated option.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Livestock Conservancy {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Slow Food USA, Chefs Collaborative, and four other organizations to found the Renewing America's Food Traditions collaboration. The effort resulted in a book, Renewing America's Food Traditions, describing more than 1000varieties and species of food that are disappearing from the United States. The organization has written or published over a dozen books on heritage livestock breeds, including several on heritage poultry and waterfowl and more on general livestock conservation. Its conservation criteria and literature on livestock biodiversity are also widely used in independent publications on breeds. The Conservancy organizes an annual conference {{that focuses on the}} preservation and promotion of rare livestock breeds. For this conference, it partners with other organizations to teach members and other attendees about various aspects of rare breed livestock. For instance, in 2005, the organization partnered with the NAGP and the American Grassfed Association for a <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cryogenic preservation of rare breed genetic material, which included a tour of the USDA Livestock and Poultry Gene Bank. In 2009, the Conservancy set up an online classified advertisement system to help users find and purchase rare breeds.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical <b>discussion</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
