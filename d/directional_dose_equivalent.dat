40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{for assessing the}} pre-mission exposure of space crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) {{in terms of an}} effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent.</b> In this approach, the PHITS Monte Carlo code was used to assess the particle transport of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and trapped radiation for solar maximum and minimum conditions through an aluminum shield thickness. From these predicted spectra, and using fluence-to-dose conversion factors, a scaling ratio of the effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rate to the ICRU ambient <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> rate at a 10 mm depth was determined. Only contributions from secondary neutrons, protons, and alpha particles were considered in this analysis.

The <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> at the surface of the anthropomorphic phantom decreases from 3. 9 to 0. 18 mSv/Gy when the lateral distance from the proton field edge increases from 2. 5 to 60 cm. Measurements along the proton depth dose distribution at a constant distance of 5 cm from the primary field edge indicate a decrease in <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> as a function of depth, with a 38 % decrease relative to the surface dose at a depth of 5 cm in polystyrene.
