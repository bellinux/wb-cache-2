40|$|Employment {{protection}} affects aggregate productivity via several {{channels in}} potentially contradicting ways, {{which makes it}} difficult to establish the relationship between the two. This study focuses on the misallocation of production factors across plants, which has been shown in past studies to substantially reduce aggregate productivity. The study provides new evidence on the effect of employment protection on resource misallocation using a large dataset of manufacturing plants covering more than 90 countries. For measuring misallocation, I use the within‐industry dispersion of the marginal product of labor and total factor productivity. The results show that higher cost of dismissing redundant workers is positively associated with misallocation. The effect of dismissal cost is especially larger in <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> greater demand for adjusting labor. More specifically, the effect is larger in <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> intrinsically <b>have</b> higher layoff rate, and in <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> large positive or negative sales growth rates. ...|$|R
