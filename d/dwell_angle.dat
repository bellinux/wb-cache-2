40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the diesel engine has made {{dramatic}} progress in its performance and market penetration. However, {{in order to}} meet future emissions legislations, Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions will need to be reduced simultaneously.

40|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} principles to perform shedding motion which are; cam mechanism, dobby controlled mechanism and jacquard controlled mechanism. A dobby mechanism {{consists of three}} main parts; drive mechanism, selection mechanism and mechanism for transferring motion to the frames. Rotary dobby mechanisms are being used in shedding process of high-speed weaving machines. In this paper, design and synthesis of a novel drive mechanism had been explained. The drive mechanism, which is used in this research, is an eight component lever-gear mechanism. The most important innovation is in the motion transmission mechanism on the main shaft of rotational dobby. It is known that main shaft in rotary dobby has dwell period in only one direction. The novel drive mechanism is designed to make equally timed, double stand-by positioned oscilational motion. After designing of the rotary dobby, the mechanisms are produced and montaged. It was confirmed that dobby run well and durably with all mechanism and shedding process is precisely carried out.

50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of using}} a mechanical switch {{as part of the}} ignition timing {{is that it is not}} very precise, needs regular adjustment of the <b>dwell</b> (contact) <b>angle,</b> and at higher revolutions, its mass becomes significant, leading to poor operation at higher engine speeds. These effects can largely be overcome using electronic ignition systems, where the contact breakers are retrofitted by a magnetic (Hall effect) or optical sensor device. However, because of their simplicity, and since contact breaker points gradually degrade instead of catastrophically failing, they are still used on aircraft engines.|$|R

5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a roller follower (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle. In designing the cam, the lift and the <b>dwell</b> <b>angle</b> [...] are given.

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial distribution of fuel in cylinders is a key factor affecting the combustion characteristics and emission generation of a DI diesel engine. The airfuel mixing quality is critical for controlling ignition timing and combustion duration. Avoiding fuel-rich areas within the cylinder can significantly reduce soot formation as well as high local temperatures resulting in low NOx formation. The present investigation {{is focused on the}} effects of advanced fuel injections and air path strategies as well as the effects of piston geometry and fuel spray angle on air-fuel homogeneity, combustion process and their impacts on the performance and emission of the engine. A Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder engine in combination with AVL Fire CFD software was used in this investigation. An experimental analysis was conducted to assess the combustion characteristics and emissions formation of the engine under various injection strategies such as different injection timing, quantity, ratio, <b>dwell</b> <b>angles</b> between injections with various exhaust valve opening times and exhaust back pressures. A quan- titative factor named Homogeneity Factor (HF) was employed in the CFD code in order to quantify the air-fuel mixing and understand how the air-fuel homogeneity within the cylinder can influence the combustion and emissions of the engine. The investigation concludes that multiple injection strategies have the potential to reduce diesel emissions while maintaining meaningful fuel economy. Split injection can be used to improve the air-fuel mixture locally and control temperature generation during the start of combustion. Increased air-fuel homogeneity results in fewer fuel-rich areas within the cylinder and contributes to the reduction of soot emission. Extending the pre-mixed combustion phase has a direct effect on the reduction of soot formation while NOx generation is highly dependent on the scale of the primary fuel injection event...|$|R

There are many control variables which affect the power generated such as: firing angles, reference current, speed and voltage.

Hence, to minimize time, cost and aid in the manufacturing industry, a simulation model of the overall SRG drive is developed. The objective of the work is to identify the optimal parameters and characterize them under closed loop control.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of torque ripple {{is the main}} target in research for designing a variable drive system with switched reluctance motors (SRM) for higher torque density and better efficiency. This ripple {{is due to the}} transition of excitation current between the adjacent phases. Precise control of turn-on and turn off angle is required to smooth the torque. In this paper, the effects of selecting the turn-on and turn-off angles are simulated in detail. It is observed that with the extended turn-on and turn off angles, the precise selection of turn-on and turn off angle can alter the shape of the excitation current in the stator coil and its point of overlapping with the adjacent coil. Therefore the transition between different phases can be smoothed out. The impact of this alteration on the excitation current and torque ripple as a function of different parameters of <b>dwell</b> <b>angle</b> is studied in detail in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel idea of developing an absolute, general choice multilevel asymmetric power converter for {{switched reluctance motor}} (SRM) drive suitable specifically in electric vehicle applications. For SRM drives, the suitability of a particular inverter circuit changes with the motor geometry.

The results indicated that two-stage injection has the potential for simultaneous reduction of NO and soot emissions. Nevertheless, the studied two-stage strategies resulted in higher soot emission, mainly due to the interaction between two consecutive fuel injection events, whereby the fuel sprays during the second injection were injected into burning regions, generating fuel-rich combustion. In addition, the variable two-stage strategies produced high levels of uHC emission in comparison to single and twin split injection cases. This was mainly attributed to firstly greater fuel quantity injected during the second injection and secondly poor mixing and air utilisation during the second fuel injection event. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The crystal structures of F 1, which provide the structural {{basis for the}} catalysis mechanism, have shown essentially 1 stable conformational state.

To address this issue, we introduced cysteine residues at βE 391 and γR 84 of F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS 3. In the crystal structures of the mitochondrial F 1, the corresponding residues in the ADP-bound β (βDP) and γ were in direct contact.
