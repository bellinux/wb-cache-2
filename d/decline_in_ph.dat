Acid deposition is believed to be a serious threat to many aquatic ecosystems (Haines 198 1). However, because reliable, long term records documenting decreases of pH in streams and lakes are relatively rare, par-ticular examples of acidification based on such records are especially important in the ongoing political and scientific debate over the extent of the problem. One such ex-ample was reported by Johnson (1979 a,b) for headwater streams in the environmen-tally sensitive New Jersey Pinelands. This study is particularly important because the Pinelands have been recently designated as this country’s first National Reserve, with a mandate to protect the natural terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal communities. The Pinelands are underlain by sandy soils, which are naturally characterized by low pH (3. 4 - 4. 6), poor cation exchange ca-pacity, and few exchangeable bases (Tedrow 1979).

As a control, uninoculated fermentors were also used. In all inoculated fermentors, the paired starter rapidly colonized the brines to dominate the natural microbiota and persisted throughout fermentation. A <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> to reach about 5. 0 was achieved in the first 15 - 20 days, reaching about 4. 0 {{at the end of the}} process. The lactic acid concentration in brines increased rapidly in the first 20 days of fermentation (0. 3 - 0. 4 g/ 100 ml) to give values higher than 0. 8 g/ 100 ml at the end of the process. In contrast, increasing lactic acid concentration was slower in uninoculated than in the inoculated brines, and the final concentrations were lower. Although reaching similar values at the end of the process, the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> in uninoculated fermentors was slower than in the inoculated ones.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arterial blood gases (ABGs) {{are often}} sampled incorrectly, {{leading to a}} 'mixed' or venous sample. Delays in {{analysis}} and air contamination are common. OBJECTIVES: We measured {{the effects of these}} errors in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and controls. METHODS: Arterial and venous samples were analyzed from 30 patients with COPD exacerbation and 30 controls. Venous samples were analysed immediately and arterial samples separated into non-air-contaminated and air-contaminated specimens and analysed at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 180 min. RESULTS: Mean venous pH was 7. 371 and arterial pH was 7. 407 (p < 0. 0001). There was a correlation between venous and arterial pH (r = 0. 5347, p < 0. 0001). The regression equation to predict arterial pH was: arterial pH = 4. 2289 + 0. 43113. venous pH. There were no clinically significant differences in arterial PO associated with analysis delay. A statistically significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> was detected at 30 min in patients with COPD exacerbation (p = 0. 0042) and 90 min in controls (p < 0. 0001). A clinically significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> emerged at 73 min in patients with COPD exacerbation and 87 min in controls. Air contamination was associated with a clinically significant increase in PO in all samples, including those that were immediately analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial and venous pH differ significantly. Venous pH cannot accurately replace arterial pH. Temporal delays in ABG analysis result in a significant decline in measured pH. ABGs should be analysed within 30 min. Air contamination leads to an immediate increase in measured PO, indicating that air-contaminated ABGs should be discarded...|$|E
