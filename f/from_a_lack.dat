5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo – {{a bedroom}} community of Caracas – are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, Nos.1, 18 and 31 Squadrons {{attacked}} Japanese {{positions in}} Timor, while No.2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No.79 Wing's light and medium bombers suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of suitable targets {{as they had}} few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No.2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.|$|E
5|$|The Darkside, which derives {{its name}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of street lights when {{students}} {{first began to}} move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north. Traditionally, the Darkside has served as housing for juniors. This is not due to any university policy, but rather the preference of seniors, who select houses first in the student housing lottery due to their larger number of credit hours.|$|E

5000|$|Pernicious anemia {{is caused}} by <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{intrinsic}} factor, which is required to absorb vitamin B12 <b>from</b> food. <b>A</b> <b>lack</b> of intrinsic factor may arise <b>from</b> <b>an</b> autoimmune condition targeting the parietal cells (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself. These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12.|$|R
5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the communist regime. After the revolution, the units suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of funds {{which resulted in the}} temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled {{in the past few years}} and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E

50|$|Brizola shunned the class-based, corporatist {{character}} {{of his early}} populism and adopted a Christian rhetoric of friendship {{to the people in}} general—akin to the Russian narodniks than to classical Latin American populism. This new radical populism was seen as a threat to more orderly, liberal-democratic politics. It suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> mastery of less personal mass politics techniques and required Brizola's charismatic and personal leadership of Brizola to function effectively. In Brizola's absence—or that of his persona— the PDT could not become a contender to power, hampering its development on the national level.|$|R
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{struggled}} {{in the following}} two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock as they destroyed Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street to go top of the table. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since {{the formation of the}} Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, they went into a deep slump {{during the middle of the}} season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E

5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention {{long enough for the}} Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the effects}} of Hudah, the cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike the Antalaha region in 20years. The towns of Maroantsetra and Andapa were also hit hard, with 60–70percent of homes in the latter destroyed. Maroantsetra, a coastal town, was flooded by the storm surge, and as a result seven people died. The commune of Mananara Nord was completely flooded by the storm. Other isolated villages could not be reached via road or telecommunications due to the storm. One of these cities was Sambava, which suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of available telephone links since late on April2. One person died in Sambava. A resort in the town of Cap Est was flattened. Initial estimates indicated that Hudah caused at least 100,000people to become homeless.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of logistical support.|$|E

25|$|Sexual desire {{disorders}} or decreased libido {{are characterized}} by <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> or absence for {{some period of time}} of sexual desire or libido for sexual activity or of sexual fantasies. The condition ranges <b>from</b> <b>a</b> general <b>lack</b> of sexual desire to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of sexual desire for the current partner.

5|$|Originally under Colonel J. V. B. Jervis-Read, the {{department}} suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> {{of authority and}} resources. In December 1943, Jervis-Read was replaced by Colonel Noel Wild, {{a member of the}} middle eastern 'A' Force deception department, and expanded dramatically. Wild split {{the department}} into Operations and Intelligence sections. Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh retained charge of the latter, and Wild placed Jervis-Read in command of the former. Fleetwood-Hesketh immediately expanded his staff, bringing in his brother, an MI5 liaison officer and a secretary. The operations section was not expanded until May, with three American officers and Major S. B. D. (Sam) Hood (another 'A' Force alumnus) joining the department.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built {{a few blocks away}} from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E
5|$|The Specialized Training Program was {{dissolved}} in early 1944, as {{the progress of}} the war tipped in favor of the Allies; many of the CCNY classmates were transferred to the infantry, while Koval and a dozen others were selected for the Special Engineer Detachment. The Detachment was part of the covert project to design, engineer, and fabricate an atomic bomb—an American, Canadian and British initiative known as the Manhattan Project. Koval was assigned to Oak Ridge, Tennessee; at the time, Project scientists were researching enriched uranium and plutonium-based bombs, with the Oak Ridge laboratories central to the development of both. The Project suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of human resources, and asked the Army for technically qualified men.|$|E

40|$|The Stolen Myth: Contemporary Reflections of Antiquity. Proceeding from Roland Barthes’ debunking of ”Romans on film” {{in the now}} {{classical}} collection Mythologies from 1956, {{this paper}} attempts to scrutinize certain popular notions about Greek Antiquity as resulting from so-called hypercorrections of the past. A recent exhibition of reconstructed polychrome statues and reliefs from Classical Antiquity (White Lies), and the Hollywood blockbuster movie Troy, are seen as indicative of this hypercorrecting urge. The arguments goes that such versions of the past – while still being symptomatic of an emergent historical consciousness  – suffer <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> appreciation of the categories ‘myth’ and ‘history’ in their pre-modern relationship of dynamic complementarity...|$|R
50|$|But the Adams era was short-lived. Complaints came <b>from</b> stockholders: <b>A</b> <b>lack</b> of {{communication}} <b>from</b> management, <b>a</b> failure to hold any Board of Directors meetings {{for more than}} a year, a loss of focus on local issues. This led the previous leaders of the company including Lacey and Larkin to devise a plan to take the newspaper back.|$|R
5|$|The linen {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of air cover and the inexperience {{in some of}} its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E
