5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> for the Giants.

5000|$|In mid-1964, the {{manufacturing}} of the 94 was changed {{in order to}} make the firearm less expensive to produce. Generally referred to as [...] "pre-64" [...] models, the earlier versions command a premium price over post-change rifles. The limited number of early-1964 production models produced prior to the changeover are considered quite desirable, as they are considered by many to represent the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era.</b>|$|R
5|$|Spiritual Machines {{has been}} noted as being the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> for Our Lady Peace, {{as it was the}} last album {{produced}} by the band's longtime producer Arnold Lanni, the last to feature original guitarist Mike Turner in full, and the last studio album to feature art model Saul Fox on its cover. It was also the last album to feature Maida's high-falsetto singing voice prominently. The album peaked at number five in Canada, where it is certified double platinum.|$|E
5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era.</b> The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Lekapenoi signalled the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> {{in terms}} of personalities, but Kourkouas's expansionist policy continued: he was succeeded as Domestic of the Schools by Bardas Phokas the Elder, {{followed}} by Nikephoros Phokas, who reigned as emperor in 963–969, and finally, by Kourkouas's own great-nephew, John Tzimiskes, who reigned as emperor in 969–976. All of them expanded the Byzantine frontier in the East, recovering Cilicia and northern Syria with Antioch, and converting the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo into a Byzantine protectorate.|$|E

Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day.

5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would occur at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E

In addition, there was an ownership change in what {{had been one of the}} most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, Tim Mara was diagnosed with cancer, and he sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. This marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{appropriated}} {{funding for}} the Interstate Highway System, to construct a vast network of freeways across the country. By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the west) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates. Major decommissioning of former routes began with California's highway renumbering in 1964. The 1985 removal of US66 is often seen as the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> of US highways.|$|E
5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era</b> for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of}} its release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw {{many of the}} old {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into darkness. A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the darkness. After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into darkness symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how deans make successful {{transitions to}} leadership positions. It focuses on six areas: the typical stages of adult development; the {{rites of passage}} of new deans; how academics are socialized into administration; the keys for successful entry {{into the role of}} dean; what beginning academic leaders need to know; and what strategies new deans employ in order to begin establishing their professional identities. The paper discusses stages of transition into the new deanship; (1) engagement (the professorial plateau); (2) separation (the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era),</b> which includes disengagement, disidentification, disenchantment and disorientation; (3) transition (the valley of despair); (4) incorporation (the new beginning); and re-engagement/renewal (the stage of success). Factors influencing dean transition include the new dean's origin, experience, gender, ethnicity, and family. The paper concludes with eight tips on transitions. (Contains 70 references.) (SM...|$|R

In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. The sale was actually worked out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwards, so as to avoid distracting the team. It marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
