40|$|Kinetics and {{efficacy}} of deferoxamine in iron-overloaded hemodialysis patients. We evaluated the kinetics {{and efficacy}} of deferoxamine (DFO) therapy in iron-overloaded hemodialysis patients. Concentrations of DFO and its chelated product, feroxamine (Fx), were assessed following single-dose DFO administration in twelve patients, and during chronic therapy over one year's time in eight, similarly iron-overloaded dialysis patients. A functional assay which relies on measurements of iron and iron binding capacity for the determination of Fx and DFO, respectively, was corroborated with liquid chromatographic techniques. Half-life measurements were also corroborated with tracer doses of 14 C-DFO and 59 Fe-feroxamine. Intradialytic DFO half-life (2. 3 ± 1. 1 h) was considerably less than interdialytic half-life (26 ± 1 <b>hr).</b> <b>Unbound</b> DFO was found to persist throughout the interdialytic period. Calculation of the percent saturation of the DFO dose indicated that only 30 % of a given dose is chelated. The amount of iron removed dialytically was approximately 13. 1 ± 2. 7 mg per dialysis session. Chronic DFO administration was also shown to enhance gastrointestinal iron excretion threefold. However, ferritin levels decreased by only 25 % after one year of thrice-weekly DFO therapy. We conclude that DFO therapy for iron-overloaded hemodialysis patients is optimized by its administration interdialytically, and results in slow removal of iron, via both dialytic and gastrointestinal routes...|$|E
