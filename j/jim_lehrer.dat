5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources.

The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|R

George Neumayr, the executive editor of The American Spectator, a conservative magazine, told the NewsHour with <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer</b> that [...] "PBS looks like a liberal monopoly to me, and Bill Moyers is Exhibit A of that very strident, left-wing bias... uses his show as a platform from which to attack conservatives and Republicans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} reform movement was founded as {{a non-profit organization}} by several political figures: Democrats Hamilton Jordan, Gerald Rafshoon, and Republican consultants Doug Bailey [...] and Jim Jonas and the former two-term independent Maine Governor Angus King. Unity08 is attempting to leverage online technology, such as secure voting, to allow American voters to determine the most crucial issues facing the country, discuss them with potential nominees, and participate in an online convention to nominate a bipartisan presidential ticket. [...] In an interview that aired on The NewsHour with <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer</b> in May 2006, Unity08's founders said that the group was formed {{in response to the}} polarization between the Republican and Democratic political parties.

2500|$|The {{popularity}} {{of his books}} and his natural on-camera demeanor have resulted in many media appearances, including Charlie Rose, The Colbert Report, The NewsHour with <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer,</b> The Century with Peter Jennings, CNN, TIME, Nightline in Primetime, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and the Late Show with David Letterman.

2500|$|On July 27, 2007, both White House Press Secretary Tony Snow and White House {{spokeswoman}} Dana Perino defended Gonzales's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony {{regarding the}} events of March 10, 2004, saying {{that it did not}} contradict the sworn House Judiciary Committee account of FBI director Robert S. Mueller III, because Gonzales had been constrained in what he could say because there was a danger he would divulge classified material. Lee Casey, a former Justice Department lawyer during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, told The NewsHour with <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer</b> that {{it is likely that the}} apparent discrepancy can be traced to the fact that there are two separate Domestic Surveillance programs. [...] "The program that was leaked in December 2005 is the Comey program. It is not the program that was discussed in the evening when they went to Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital room. That program we know almost nothing about. We can speculate about it. …The program about which he said there was no dispute is a program that was created after the original program died, when Mr. Comey refused to reauthorize it, in March 2004. Mr. Comey then essentially redid the program to suit his legal concerns. And about that program, there was no dispute. There was clearly a dispute about the earlier form or version of the program. The attorney general has not talked about that program. He refers to it as [...] "other intelligence activities" [...] because it is, in fact, still classified." ...|$|E
