40|$|Summary- Two {{methods of}} making kneaded plastic cheeses from ewe's milk were compared. The {{first one was}} the slow acidified curd {{procedure}} by biological means, as used in traditional <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese,</b> and the second was the rapid acidified curd procedure, by using additional citric acid. Tradi-tional cheese had an 8 % higher yield than the chemically acidified one, due to the higher recoveries of milk constituents in cheese (fat, protein, total solids). Differences in pH, ash, Ca, P and NaCI con-tents of mature cheeses were also observed. In contrast, {{no significant differences in}} moisture, fat, pro-tein, soluble-N and quality between the two types of cheese were noted. So, both technologies of kneaded plastic cheese production can be used, but higher yield and minerai retention (Ca and P) were obtained for traditional cheese. The rapid acidified cheese was superior for controlling the acidification process, permeability to NaCI and involved a shorter acidification time of the curd, resulting in poten-tially better mechanization of the cheesemaking procedure. kneaded plastic cheese 1 <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese</b> 1 acidified cheese 1 ripening Résumé- Étude comparative de 2 méthodes de préparation de fromage à pâte filée de lait de brebis.

40|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ACA-DC 178, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from Greek <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese,</b> produces a cell-wall-bound proteinase. The proteinase {{was removed from}} the cell envelope by washing the cells with a Ca 2 +-free buffer. The crude proteinase extract shows its highest activity at pH 6. 0 and 40 °C. It is inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, showing that the enzyme is a serine-type proteinase. Considering the substrate specificity, the enzyme is similar to the lactococcal PI-type proteinases, since it hydrolyzes β-casein mainly and α- and κ-caseins to a much lesser extent. The cell-wall-bound proteinase from L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ACA-DC 178 liberates four main peptides from β-casein, which have been identified...|$|E

40|$|The species Streptococcus macedonicus is {{associated}} with the food environment, especially with fermented dairy products. Here we present the complete 2. 1 -Mb genome sequence of strain ACA-DC 198, which was isolated from naturally fermented Greek <b>kasseri</b> <b>cheese.</b> Streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species,since its most frequent source of isolation to date is fermented foods, mainly of dairy origin (5). Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is considered nonpathogenic, due to its adaptation to the milk environment (3, 8). Even though S. macedonicus has been shown to possess important (bio) techno-logical features similar to those of S. thermophilus (5), it belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex (13). It has been proposed that S. macedonicus is a subspecies of S. gallolyticus, along with S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis biotype I) and Streptococcus pasteurianus (formerly S. bovis biotype II. 2) (13). This classification scheme is not universally accepted (15); how-ever, {{there is no doubt that}} S. macedonicus is phylogeneticall...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, {{a strain}} {{isolated}} from Greek <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese,</b> produces a food-grade lantibiotic named macedocin. Macedocin has a molecular mass of 2, 794. 76 ± 0. 42 Da, {{as determined by}} electrospray mass spectrometry. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 22 amino acid residues that correspond with the amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics SA-FF 22 and SA-M 49, {{both of which were}} isolated from the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Macedocin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, as well as several food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium tyrobutyricum. It displays a bactericidal effect towards the most sensitive indicator strain, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei LMG 13558 T, while the producer strain itself displays autoinhibition when it is grown under conditions that do not favor bacteriocin production. Macedocin is active at pHs between 4. 0 and 9. 0, and it retains activity even after incubation for 20 min at 121 °C with 1 atm of overpressure. Inhibition of macedocin by proteolytic enzymes is variable...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus delbreuckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus delbreuckii subsp. bulgaricus are {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} commonly exploited by the dairy industry as starter cultures, mainly {{for the production of}} cheese and yogurt. In this work, we present the comparative genomic analysis between the recently sequenced genomes of L. lactis ACA-DC 178 and L. bulgaricus ACA DC 87, isolated from <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese</b> and yogurt, respectively. The genome of L. lactis ACA-DC 178 is larger than that of L. bulgaricus ACA-DC 87, containing 2, 048 and 1, 928 protein coding genes, respectively. Full chromosome alignments revealed strain specific differences, although a high degree of synteny between the two strains was also observed. The core genome of the two stains contained about 1, 300 genes while the unique genes of the two strains were als oidentified. The two genomes contained several genomic islands, indicating that a number of genes have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. We also predicted one confirmed CRISPR system in each genome, three potential antimicrobial peptides in total and also prophage sequences integrated into the genomes of the two strains. Overall,our analysis provides useful insights into the technological potential of the ACA-DC 178 and ACA-DC 87 strains...|$|E
40|$|Growth of and {{bacteriocin}} {{production by}} Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 were assessed and modeled under conditions simulating <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese</b> production. Controlled fermentations were performed in milk supplemented with yeast extract at {{different combinations of}} temperature (25, 40, and 55 °C), constant pH (pHs 5 and 6), and added NaCl (at concentrations of 0, 2, and 4 %, wt/vol). The data obtained were used to construct two types of predictive models, namely, a modeling approach based on the gamma concept, {{as well as a}} model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The latter computational methods were used on 36 control fermentations to quantify the complex relationships between the conditions applied (temperature, pH, and NaCl) and population behavior and to calculate the associated biokinetic parameters, i. e., maximum specific growth and cell count decrease rates and specific bacteriocin production. The functions obtained were able to estimate these biokinetic parameters for four validation fermentation experiments and obtained good agree-ment between modeled and experimental values. Overall, these experiments show that both methods can be successfully used to unravel complex kinetic patterns within biological data of this kind and to predict population kinetics. Whereas ANNs yield a better correlation between experimental and predicted results, th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStreptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a {{bacteriocin}} producer {{isolated from}} Greek <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese,</b> {{was used in}} a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to evaluate its pathogenic potential. The strain was examined in vitro for haemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance and presence of pathogenicity genes encountered in Streptococcus pyogenes. Subsequently, the strain was orally administered to mice (8. 9 log cfu daily), continuously over a period of 12 weeks, in order to ascertain the effects of its long term consumption on animal health and gastric inflammation. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to be non-haemolytic and sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin, with the only resistance observed against kanamycin. PCR amplification and DNA-DNA hybridization did not reveal the presence of any of the S. pyogenes pathogenicity genes examined, namely emm, scpA, hasA, speB, smez 2, speJ, sagAB, hylA, ska, speF, speG, slo, hylP 2 and mga. In the mouse study, no detrimental effects were observed in the behaviour, general well being, weight gain and water consumption of the animals receiving S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Histologic analysis showed no evidence of inflammation in the stomach of the animals receiving S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198, while faecal microbiological analysis revealed that the strain retained its viability passing through the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Finally, no evidence of translocation to the liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes was observed. In conclusion, none of the examined virulence determinants were detected in S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 and its long term, high dosage oral administration did not appear to induce any pathogenic effect in mice...|$|E
40|$|The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) {{consists}} of species {{commonly found in}} the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of herbivores. Certain members of the complex like Streptococcus macedonicus and Streptococcus infantarius are frequently isolated from traditional fermented foods, mostly of dairy origin. However, some species of this complex, like Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus pasteurianus are known pathogens of humans involved {{in a range of}} diseases including endocarditis, menengitis, bacteremia, colon cancer etc. Analysis of the genome of S. macedonicus strain ACA-DC 198 isolated from traditional Greek <b>Kasseri</b> <b>cheese</b> revealed important traits of adaptation to the dairy environment. The strain contains a significant percentage of potential pseudogenes indicating that it may have evolved through genome decay processes. Streptococcus macedonicus has an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism unique among the SBSEC members and a typical proteolytic system required for casein hydrolysis. Furthermore, we found evidence in the genome of S. macedonicus suggesting HGT (horizontal gene transfer) events with potential donors Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. Perhaps the most pronounced among these HGT events is the presence in S. macedonicus of pSMA 198 which belongs to the lactococcal pCI 305 /pWV 02 family of plasmids. Our analysis suggests that pSMA 198 may have been acquired by S. macedonicus from L. lactis. Analogous traits have been reported for S. infantarius suggesting that at least these two strains present adaptations to the dairy environment among SBSEC. Finally, we were able to identify a number of potential virulence factors (VFs) within the SBSEC members whose presence varied among species of the complex. Streptococcus macedonicus and S. infantarius miss some of the VFs present in S. gallolyticus suggesting a diminished pathogenic potential for the two species...|$|E
