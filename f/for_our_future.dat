2500|$|While {{science fiction}} and magical realism both bend {{the notion of}} what is real, toy with human imagination, and are forms of (often fantastical) fiction, they differ greatly.

Huxley portrays {{a world where the}} population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs, which are controlled by the government. In this world, there is no link between copulation and reproduction. Humans are produced in giant test tubes, where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates. Bowers argues that, [...] "The science fiction narrative's distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>future.</b> Unlike magical realism, it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality." ...|$|E

Upon discovering that the girl was using her sister's ID because she {{was too young to}} work, Manson abandoned her, shortly after which he ran into two clubbers from South Florida.

2500|$|Some {{writers on}} Heidegger's work see {{possibilities}} within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly [...] "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer", does show {{an interest in}} initiating such a dialogue. Heidegger himself had contact {{with a number of}} leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe and Kuki Shūzō. [...] It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger's thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Reinhard May records Chang Chung-Yuan saying that [...] "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought." [...] May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts: [...] "The investigation concludes that Heidegger’s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>future</b> interpretation of Heidegger’s work." ...|$|E

Professor Clive Greated wrote that [...] "thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: [...] "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK {{as it has in}} the US. Science and engineering are important <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>future,</b> and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing." [...] Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion [...] "that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics" [...] was [...] "ridiculous balderdash". According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a [...] "pseudoscientific docudrama", saying [...] "Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought." ...|$|E

Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them.
