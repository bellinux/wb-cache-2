40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>tar</b> {{burns and}} removal of tar are unusual {{emergencies}} {{seen in the}} emergency departments. Because of the dense structure, cleaning difficulties and high temperature of the tar, tar burns requires a different management than the other burns. We present a 32 year old man who presents to our emergency department with <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> burn...|$|R
60|$|The old {{whitewash}} brush was handed to the leader. Si dipped it {{deeply into the}} pot of <b>hot</b> <b>tar,</b> and approached the young oarsman.|$|R
60|$|In a rage, Si Peters {{started to}} plaster Jerry's {{mouth with the}} <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> But ere the brush could descend, Mr. Upton and Towser burst upon the scene.|$|R

5000|$|On one occasion, {{the item}} at stake was an autographed baseball; they {{brought out a}} paint can full of <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> in which to {{submerge}} it. However, Mark decided that the baseball was too expensive and instead threw it into the audience.|$|R
5000|$|In the American {{television}} series from the 1970s, All in the Family, the character Edith Bunker reminisced about a weekend she {{spent at the}} lake with a boy she was dating, and his parents. The boy {{grew up to be}} a <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> watcher.|$|R
60|$|The {{vessel was}} {{on the eve of}} departure. Her deck {{presented}} that scene of bustle and alacrity dear to the sailor's heart. Men were busy nailing up the masts, hanging the bowsprit over the side, varnishing the lee-scuppers and pouring <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> down the companion-way.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>tar</b> burns, {{although}} rare, usually {{occur in}} {{workers in the}} paving and roofing industries. When tar is heated to high temperatures it can cause deep burns, and its removal often causes further damage. However, the use {{of one of the}} polysorbates (surface-active agents) makes removal easy and painless...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you don't!" [...] cried Sam, {{and knocked}} the weapon {{from his hand}} with the brush. This action caused the <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> to leave a heavy streak over Baxter's face and neck, and {{he let out a}} yell that would have done credit to an Indian on the warpath.|$|R
5000|$|The victim {{would be}} {{stripped}} naked, or stripped to the waist. <b>Hot</b> <b>tar</b> was then either poured or painted onto the person {{while he was}} immobilized. Then the victim either had feathers thrown on him or was rolled around {{on a pile of}} feathers so that they stuck to the tar.|$|R

50|$|Control joints (often {{confused}} with expansion joints) are {{cut into the}} concrete or asphalt, and are different from expansion joints. Control joints are cut into the pavement at regular intervals to allow cracking to occur in a controlled fashion.

50|$|The quarry {{produced}} limestone {{for use in}} construction, {{industry and}} agriculture, starting when the Furness Line railway opened nearby in 1857, providing a means of moving the output. A new method to produce Tarmacadam was developed, using <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> from the gasworks at nearby Carnforth to mix with crushed limestone. The quarry closed in 1959, having employed 20 to 30 men {{for most of its}} active life.|$|R
50|$|The film follows Papashvily {{from his}} arrival and initial {{immigrant}} inspection on Ellis Island, through his early jobs on New York's bustling Lower East Side. His friend, Nuri (Kurt Kasznar), {{who had arrived}} in New York earlier and speaks English, leads the way, telling Giorgi that he'll help him get an outdoor job with plenty of fresh air. Instead, they find themselves carrying buckets and pouring <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> on rooftops.|$|R
5000|$|After {{an initial}} scene {{featuring}} a Ford which is extremely reluctant to start, {{most of the}} action takes place on an excursion ferry. Gags revolve around seasickness, which Charlie, an fat couple, and even the boat's all-black ragtime band succumb to, deckchairs, and Charlie's comic pugnacity. This {{is followed by a}} scene of the family returning home, and encountering trouble at an intersection, which involves a traffic cop, and <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b>|$|R
25|$|In October 1993, The Straits Times, Singapore's main English-language newspaper, {{reported}} that car vandalism in Singapore {{was on the}} rise. Cars parked at apartment blocks were being damaged with <b>hot</b> <b>tar,</b> paint remover, red spray paint, and hatchets. Taxi drivers complained that their tires were slashed. In the city center, cars were found with deep scratches and dents. One man complained {{that he had to}} refinish his car six times in six months.|$|R
50|$|On 26 May, Prime Minister Bandaranaike {{said the}} riots had {{started with the}} death of Nuwara Eliya mayor D.A. Seneviratne the {{previous}} day (actually the riots had begun three days before). This gave people the impression that Tamils were behind the riots. Soon gangs began beating Tamils in Colombo and several of its suburbs. Shops were burned and looted. Tamil women were subjected to rape and their babies were murdered by dumping them in <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} it was only in a {{partially}} sheltered state. The joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with a quantity of tarpaulin, which the seamen had laid over with successive coats of <b>hot</b> <b>tar,</b> and the sides of the erection had been painted with three coats of white lead. Between the timber framing of the habitable part, the interstices were stuffed with moss, but the green baize cloth with which it was afterwards lined had not been put on when Bremner took possession.|$|R

60|$|Spokane, {{being the}} only center of iron, steel, brick, and masonry in this area, resembled a city of furnaces. Business was slack. The asphalt of the streets left clean {{imprints}} of a pedestrian's feet; bits of newspaper stuck fast to the <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> Down by the gorge, where the great green river made its magnificent plunges over the falls, people congregated, tarried, and were loath to leave, for here the blowing mist and the air set into motion by the falling water created a temperature that was relief.|$|R
50|$|Harryhausen {{originally}} planned for an Arsinoitherium {{to make an}} appearance in the film. The massive, two-horned prehistoric rhinoceros-like creature was intended to fight the troglodyte in the ancient shrine of the Arimaspi in the arctic. Harryhausen did preproduction designs showing the beast defeating the troglodyte, then getting caught and dying {{in a pool of}} <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> Harryhausen also said he planned to have Sinbad and his crew fight a yeti in the arctic, but that idea was ultimately rejected in favor of a giant walrus. Harryhausen's stop-motion animation work lasted from October 1975 up to March 1977.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 PBS {{animated}} series Liberty's Kids showed characters James and Sarah {{witnessing a}} British sailor being tarred and feathered by a Philadelphia mob. Sarah is shocked, but James finds {{the sight of}} it funny, thinking the sailor is only being humiliated. Later James's mentor Moses takes James to interview the sailor, only to find him in an 18th-Century doctor's care. There he finds out the mob used boiling <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> and the sailor suffered severe skin burns, made even worse by a looming infection. Seeing the victim moaning in bed and bandaged all over, James is horrified.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of funding in recent years, {{sections}} of important routes have fallen into disrepair causing damage to vehicles and has also led, to a lesser extent, to minor accidents. The repair of roads in Scotland is slow, sporadic and by European standards it uses somewhat antiquated techniques.For example, clusters of small potholes on main roads are filled up locally with <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> or low quality asphalt instead of repaving the entire road section. In many instances this method is used as a permanent repair. Another method is repaving either small areas or short stretches of carriageway where damage is most severe making for treacherous, uneven surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Two of Levant's selectmen asked Higgins {{to leave}} town, which {{he refused to}} do. A mob of about 150, {{some of whom were}} masked, dragged Higgins from the house of disciple Ruel Clement one night in 1899, {{stripped}} him naked, covered him with <b>hot</b> <b>tar,</b> and applied a coat of chicken feathers. He was then ridden to the edge of town on a wooden rail, and left there with the warning not to return. He did return to Clement's house, however, and Clement's complaint to the Sheriff of Penobscot County led to the arrest and trial in Bangor of 29 people, many of them 'solid citizens' of Levant.|$|R
25|$|The {{operation}} did {{not bring}} about the desired success; for instance, on occasions when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. Rarely would anyone be sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two main responses in dealing with a tunnel opening were to flush the entrance with gas, water or <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open, or to toss a few grenades down the hole and “crimp” off the opening. This approach proved ineffective due {{to the design of}} the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.|$|R
50|$|Professor Farnsworth is chasing his escaped gargoyle, Pazuzu. After a short time, {{he forgets}} {{the search and}} goes to Florida to have a {{discounted}} dinner. Annoyed with the Professor's crankiness, the Planet Express employees take the 161-year-old to an age-reducing spa, where he is given a massage, then bathed in blistering <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> An accident causes the entire crew {{to fall into the}} tar pit, reverting them to a younger age. Leela decides to live with her parents so that she can have a new chance at the normal teenage life she never had. A teenage Fry and Leela begin dating while Amy is the subject of jokes back on Mars due to her childhood obesity. The Professor searches for a way to undo the de-aging effects. It seems that time-altering chronitons have become stuck to their DNA.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{has become}} {{suspicious}} about the body which Trench supplied to him, after his friend Kemp (Rupert Davies) finds it {{washed up on}} a riverbank. Julian confronts Trench, who tells him the truth about Sir Edward's [...] "death". Soon after, Trench is dispatched by Sir Edward, but not before he tells him the whereabouts of N'Galo. Hoping he will cure him of his disfigurement, Sir Edward asks N'Galo for his help. Here Sir Edward learns the truth about his time in Africa: {{in a case of}} mistaken identity he was punished for his brother's crime of killing an African child. N'Galo fails to cure Sir Edward, and they fight; N'Galo stabs Sir Edward and is rewarded with a face full of <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> Sir Edward returns to Newhartt's home, where Newhartt tends to his wound. Mistrusting Newhartt's medical treatment, Sir Edward fatally wounds him and sets off to confront his brother.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the last}} tarring and {{feathering}} episodes in Maine took place in Levant in 1899, the victim being an evangelical minister named George W. Higgins of the Disciples of the Holy Ghost, whose headquarters was the Shiloh Temple in Durham, Maine, and whose spiritual leader was Frank Sandford. Higgins had made about 15 converts in Levant, and encouraged them to turn over all their property to Sandford and go {{to live in the}} Durham temple. After one member had committed suicide and Higgins had told another to whip a small child because he was possessed by a demon, two selectmen ordered him to leave town. When he refused, a mob seized him, covered him with <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> and feathers, and rode him on a rail a number of miles to the town line, some following behind in carriages. [...] An area in town where many [...] "Higginsites" [...] lived was known as [...] "Higginsville" [...] as late as the 1930s.|$|R
60|$|Besides laying, boring, trenailing, wedging, and {{grouting}} thirty-two stones, {{several other}} operations were proceeded {{with on the}} rock at low-water, {{when some of the}} artificers were employed at the railways and at high-water at the beacon-house. The seamen having prepared a quantity of tarpaulin or cloth laid over with successive coats of <b>hot</b> <b>tar,</b> the joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with it. This sort of covering was lighter and more easily managed than sheet-lead in such a situation. As a further defence against the weather the whole exterior of this temporary residence was painted with three coats of white-lead paint. Between the timber framing of the habitable part of the beacon the interstices were to be stuffed with moss as a light substance that would resist dampness and check sifting winds; the whole interior was then to be lined with green baize cloth, so that both without and within the cabins were to have a very comfortable appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The tar and feather scene also {{improperly}} uses a black, modern tar. In reality, {{the liquid}} known as tar in the 18th century was pine tar, a liquid {{which is more}} often light-brown in color. The tar that we know today is actually called petroleum tar or bitumen. Pine tar also has a low melting point, and would not burn the skin the way that <b>hot</b> petroleum <b>tar</b> would.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{effectiveness}} of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs in a low gear to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls {{in much the same way}} as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as 'chip chasers' which followed behind the <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{walls of}} the Astrakhan Kremlin were {{equipped}} with prongs the slots of which allowed to fire from handguns against enemies. At the same place at the top tier were formed [...] "Varnitsa" [...] - holes through which boiled water or <b>hot</b> <b>tar</b> was poured on attackers. During those times the system of organization of “fire fighting” of the fortress was invoked {{as one of the}} most modern systems in whole Russia. Construction of Assumption Cathedral, which began in 1699 on the first of October, was probably the most significant event that was held on the territory of the Astrakhan Kremlin. Thirty professional stonemasons were invited led by bondman architect Dorotheos Myakisheva. Building of the Cathedral lasted almost 12 years. During this time, the architects created the temple with proper cubic form with five heads. The external of the Cathedral was decorated with molded brick and carved with white stone. Windows and dome heads were framed by columns in the style of Corinthian décor and semicircular arches were filled with paintings with biblical plot. Three of such arches were arranged on each side of the temple.|$|R
2500|$|The senior Rivers, {{also called}} William, was the master gunner aboard the Victory {{and it is}} thanks to his commonplace book (now kept in the Royal Naval Museum library in Portsmouth) {{that many of the}} {{thoughts}} of the sailors aboard Nelson's flagship are preserved.

50|$|On November 30, 1935, {{six members}} of The Modern Democratic Party, a socialist organization, were arrested by Tampa Police in a warrant-less raid {{on one of their}} {{meetings}} and taken to the station. None of them were charged with any crime, however, three of them, Joseph Shoemaker, Eugene Poulnot, and Sam Rogers, were kidnapped by masked Klansmen as they left the police station. They were taken to a wooded area near the Tampa suburb of Brandon where they were flogged and burned with <b>hot</b> <b>tar.</b> Shoemaker died nine days later {{as a result of his}} injuries. The Hillsborough county Sheriff in cooperation with the state attorney mounted an investigation, eventually concluding that the attack was orchestrated by city employees and the Tampa Police. Five of the seven officers who raided the Modern Democrats meeting, and one other officer, were charged with the murder of Joseph Shoemaker, kidnapping, assault, and the attempted murder of Eugene Poulnot and Sam Rogers. As the investigation continued, evidence surfaced indicating the involvement of the Ku Klux Klan. Shoemaker’s brother had received threats from the Klan by phone, and known Klan leader had been seen at police headquarters shortly before the kidnappings. Three more people, reputed Klansmen, were arrested and charged in the incident, and a former Tampa Police Chief, R.G. Tittsworth, as well as a police department stenographer, were charged as accessories after the fact. 11 people, all connected with either Tampa Police Department or the KKK, were charged in connection to the kidnappings and murder.|$|R
