Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The more you learn, the more you know that you don't know anything at all." [...] Writing in his study of Harrison's musical career, Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song [...] "It's All Too Much", where Harrison sings: [...] "The more <b>I</b> <b>learn,</b> the less I know." ...|$|E
500|$|Until the 13th century, the Japanese {{preferred}} Bai Juyi {{above all}} poets {{and there were}} few references to Du Fu, although his influence {{can be seen in}} some kanshi ("Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets") anthologies such as Bunka Shūreishū in the 9th century. The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu's poetry was Kokan Shiren (1278–1346), a Rinzai Zen patriarch {{and one of the most}} prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol. 11 of Saihokushū. His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated [...] "influenced by Du Fu" [...] in their prefaces. Chūgan's student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu's poetry in the mundane world; one day Nijō Yoshimoto, the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry, asked Gidō, [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai?" [...] Gidō dared to reply, [...] "Yes if you do have enough capability. No if do not." [...] Since then, there had been many seminars on Du Fu's poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society, and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period, e.g., Taiheiki, a historical epic in the late 14th century, and some noh plays such as Hyakuman, Bashō, and Shunkan.|$|E

2500|$|Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: [...] "Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally {{and liked}} personally, played my brother, {{but he was}} {{extremely}} cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I sensed a bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> why." [...] Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, [...] "Gadg" [...] (Kazan) had told Quinn—who {{had taken over the}} role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.|$|E

I'm ready to shout about it.

Was this really possible? Whether they used condoms or not, people who took Truvada, as prescribed, were protected from the virus?" ...|$|E

In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on 'What are the people in Mission Control really like?' One of their questions was 'Weren't there times when everybody, {{or at least a}} few people, just panicked?' My answer was 'No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.' I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, 'That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.' Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladys Hunt, in Read for Your Life, gives two themes for the book. The first {{speaks of}} the {{possibility}} of magical happenings in the real world. Though Jenny at first refuses to imagine that Peter's talk of visions could be true, other characters are not so certain. Mr. Evans the farmer maintains that there are [...] "things as can't be explained", despite the skepticism of his family. Later in the story Jenny visits Professor Rhys and tells him about Peter's visions, hoping he will give her a reasonable explanation for them. Instead he shocks her by admitting he believes magical occurrences are possible and superstitions may be rooted in facts, saying [...] "the more <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> the less I know... Why should there not be forces we do not understand?" [...] The second theme Hunt mentions is that people's lives form patterns, sometimes woven together so that the actions of one may affect another's, even centuries apart, as Peter returning Taliesin's key brings peace to both of them.|$|E
