5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), {{then it will}} be called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane, which has winds of between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further {{then it will be}} rated as a Category 2 hurricane, if it has winds of between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be a}} major hurricane by the warning centers. A Category 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136kn (130–156mph, 209–251km/h), while a Category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn (157mph, 252km/h). A post tropical cyclone <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> has weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property. They may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.|$|E

Multiple infractions will result in higher penalties under the AMPS system.|$|E

25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential quantifier, ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E
25|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} the neural process that allows humans to {{perceive}} their surroundings as a seamless, unified image despite rapid changes in fixation points. The human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly, {{focusing on a}} single point for only {{a short period of}} time before moving to the next point. These rapid eye movements are called saccades. If a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points, the image on screen would be a blurry, nauseating mess. Despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system, the normal experience is of a stable visual world; an example of perceptual constancy. Transsaccadic memory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> contributes to this stability.|$|E

For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, {{with the exception of}} the UK, where if a game contains certain material, it must be rated by BBFC. The PEGI ratings are legally binding in Vienna and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age.|$|E

25|$|Intelligent agent paradigm: An {{intelligent}} agent <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest {{intelligent agent}}s are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include {{human beings and}} organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works – some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.|$|E

However, in case of entrepreneurship research, these notions are employed by academics too, but vaguely. According to Cattell, personality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> is related to the environment. He further adds that the system seeks explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both - traits and attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced with a given situation. A person's response is triggered by his/her personality and the situation that is faced.|$|E
