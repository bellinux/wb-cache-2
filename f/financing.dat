5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in <b>financing</b> the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and <b>financing.</b> Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was <b>financing.</b> The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E

5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast <b>financing</b> gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast <b>financing</b> gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra <b>financing</b> gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast <b>financing</b> gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private <b>financing</b> would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt <b>financing</b> would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private <b>financing</b> would not allow more lines to be built. The cost was estimated at NOK 100 million.|$|E

Moreover, a link exists between ROSCA participation and house (or shack) ownership.
