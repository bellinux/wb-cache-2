40|$|La Maddalena {{exploratory}} tunnel, {{located in}} the Italy Western Alps (Susa Valley), {{is one of the}} four exploratory adits, three in France, completed in 2010, and one in Italy, whose realization is related to Turin-Lyon high-speed rail project. Concerning tectonical setting ‘‘Pennidic Domain''is involved in the excavation, and more in details the contact between Piemontese Zone (mainly Calceshits and green stones Unit) and Brianzonese Zone (Ambin Massif Unit and related coverage). However from pk 0 + 200 m the <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> crosses the Ambin Massif represented by gneiss and micascists. Several monitoring data have been recorded during the excavation, in order to asses geological parameters important for the future Base Tunnel realization. This <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> is now still under completion. The main aim of this work is to compare the experimental hydrogeological monitoring data with the project hypothesises (Italferr Spa, 2009) in order to check the correctness of inflow forecast in term of discharge, temperature and chemical facies of groundwater. The analysed monitoring data cover the period {{since the beginning of the}} excavation of "La Maddalena" <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> to the pk 5 + 548 m (July 2016). During the excavation phase, the hydrogeological monitoring has then concerned: • daily measure of the total inflow rate; • bimonthly measure of conductivity, temperature and pH of each punctual water inflow; • sampling and chemical analysis of some of the main inflows. The comparison between expected and measured hydrogeological elements have given important information: water inflow began only after the Ambin Massif Unit was reached by excavation and therefore intercepted water flows were less than expected in design. At ch. 5 + 548 (27 - 07 - 2016) a total inflow of 55. 4 l/s is reported. This value is below the minimum stable expected inflow rate. The temperature of inflows varies between 13. 7 °C at ch. 0 + 246 and 39. 5 °C at ch. 5 + 289 (20 - 22 - 07 - 2016). The trend of the total inflow rate analysed considering rainfall patterns registered in four rainfall stations, seems to show a generalised lack of direct correlation with precipitation. Temperature and chemical composition of punctual water inflow have also given the possibility to find out some characteristics concerning the hydrogeological water supply circuits: i. e. the values of temperature registered along the excavation and the temperature water trend increasing with the excavation, indicate a quite slow hydrogeological circuit interesting the excavation area, even if the water temperature is generally lower than the temperature of the rock measured over time along the excavation. La Maddalena <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> experience confirms the importance to realize exploratory tunnels previously the excavation of a main tunnel. Having regard to the rate and temperature of water inflows registered during the excavation, a possible geothermal use of this intercepted water resource could be evaluated more in details.

Although both the models with optimised parameter sets give comparable predictions of settlements due to the adit, predictions of the behaviour of the whole tunnel differ substantially. Predictions by the hypoplastic model {{appear to be more}} reasonable, but detailed conclusions cannot be drawn yet. They will be available after excavation of the whole tunnel in 2009. 1...|$|E

In reality the cave is in fact a charcoal burners' cave and no tunnel has been discovered however, it makes for a romantic smuggling story. An alternative explanation is that it was an <b>exploratory</b> mine <b>adit.</b> Ethy House is a Georgian house of two storeys and seven bays.|$|R
40|$|Back-analysis from {{displacements}} {{has been}} attracting {{the interest of}} the rock engineering profession in recent years. It has been applied since its inception in the 1970 's because of its instinctive practical value to the designer. In this paper we discuss the principles and application of one feasible method, that of Three-dimensional displacement Back-Analysis (TBA), which is used to back analyze the modulus of elasticity (E) of the rock mass and the horizontal component (P) of rock stress mainly by means of displacements measured during the the excavation of an <b>exploratory</b> geological <b>adit.</b> An attempt is also being made {{to solve the problem of}} unique resolution of TBA. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a hypoplastic model in class A predictions of a NATM tunnel in an urban environment. The Kralovo Pole tunnel is a main construction of a northern part of a Large City Ring Road construction in Brno. The tunnel was excavated in a stiff clay, is 14 m wide with 6 m to 21 m of overburden thickness. The constitutive model was calibrated using laboratory data and the parameters were optimised using monitoring data from an exploratory drift. Based on the optimised data set, the future tunnel was simulated. After the tunnel excavation the model predictive capabilities could be evaluated. In addition, a Mohr - Coulomb constitutive model was used in simulations of the <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> and plain strain model of the tunnel. The 2 D stress relief method for simulating NATM tunnels using plane strain finite elements was in the thesis evaluated by comparison with fully 3 D simulations. Three real shallow tunnels in urban environment in different stiff clays were simulated...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{determine}} the original stress state of a clay massif in the town Brno. Stress state of rock mass is generally expressed by an empirical relationship of coefficient of earth pressure at rest K 0. This coefficient can be determined by numerical methods, laboratory tests and also using inverse numerical analysis. This diploma thesis deals with the determination of the original stress state in rock mass by means of numerical modeling. Excavation of an <b>exploratory</b> <b>adit</b> R 2 has been selected as a case study for the backanalysis. It was excavated for the purpose of engineering geological survey within the construction of Královopole tunnels. The numerical model was developed using geotechnical software Plaxis 2 D and 3 D using two advanced hypoplastic models. These models did not consider stiffness anisotropy. The results of the presented diploma thesis are the values of the coefficient of earth pressure at rest K 0, obtained using four different types of numerical analyses. In addition, overconsolidation preassure of a natural clay was determined using empirical relationship by Mayne and Kulhawy (1982) and using oedometric compression tests on undisturbed samples of brno clay...|$|E
