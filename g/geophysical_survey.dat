5|$|The north-west corner {{tower is}} 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an {{entrance}} {{door on the}} east side, and originally had a loft floor. It remains uncertain {{if there was a}} second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|While Colbung {{was in the}} United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates {{were engaged}} to {{undertake}} a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> of the grave site.

5|$|A Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb {{was found}} {{at the foot of}} the citadel mound during {{construction}} activities in 2009. It was subsequently excavated by the local Antiquities Service and archaeologists from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). The tomb was plundered in antiquity but still contained pottery dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. The cooperation between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was continued later that year with a further investigation of the tomb and with a small excavation nearby and <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> of the surrounding area, in which also students from Salahaddin University participated. These investigations revealed the presence of architecture probably dating to the Neo-Assyrian period, as well as more burials belonging to subsequent centuries.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{precarious}} condition {{meant that}} the structure was not fully recorded until 2015, when the Morecambe Bay Partnership with funding from the Castle Studies Trust commissioned Greenlane Archaeology to carry out an aerial survey of the site. As well as producing a visual record of the castle from which elevations and plans could be derived, it identified features within the castle which could be buildings which no longer survive. In 2016 the University of Central Lancashire undertook a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey,</b> using it as training for archaeology students and volunteers. The survey indicated there was formerly a garden {{to the north of}} the castle, and timber structures within the castle.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
40|$|For decades, the oil {{industry}} has employed a working model for hydrocarbon exploration in which large-scale <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> are undertaken prior to a second phase of intensive, targeted drilling. This latter phase may be conducted in conjunction with further focused geophysical studies. The <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> provide lateral coverage and continuity {{that are used to}} drive placement of drilling locations. The reason for this approach is simple: wells are expensive relative to <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys.</b> Also, practical limits on lateral coverage preclude optimization of exploration targets based on well information alone...|$|R

5|$|In 1985–86 Cleveland County Archaeology Section {{carried out}} a major {{excavation}} of {{the west end of}} the nave to consolidate an area of subsidence. Its cause was the collapse of an unrecorded burial vault. The excavations found more evidence of the fire of 1289 including scorched masonry, a shattered bell and broken grave-slabs. The remains of 47 people – 21 men, 17 women, 6 children and 3 of undetermined gender – were discovered, some of whom had been buried with grave goods including a gold finger ring and jet crosses. Two chalices and patens were found alongside the remains of two priests. The skeletons were cremated and the ashes scattered in the Monks' Walk in the Priory Gardens. A <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> carried out to the west and east of the west range indicated the existence of the remains of other monastic buildings which have yet to be excavated.|$|E
5|$|One {{of those}} {{involved}} in the 1979–81 dig, archaeologist Steve Sherlock, decided to return to the site after aerial photographs revealed the presence of a rectangular Iron Age enclosure {{in the vicinity of the}} Bronze Age monuments. Initial excavations were carried out during ten days in September 2004. It was thought initially that the site was purely Iron Age or perhaps Romano-British. A more in-depth excavation was carried out in July 2005 after a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> revealed the existence of a large roundhouse, dating from the Iron Age, in the centre of the enclosure. The work revealed three roundhouses, several Iron Age ditches and a series of pits that were evidently graves. The latter came as a complete surprise and were found to date from the Anglo-Saxon period. Various artefacts dating to between 650 and 700AD were excavated but no bones were recovered, as the acidic soil had destroyed any organic material long ago. Thirty graves were found during the initial excavation.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{spent the}} summer after college in the San Juan {{volcanic}} field of Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman {{in his study of}} two extinct calderas. This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On St Andrew's Hill, to the north-west of Cullompton town centre, two Roman forts were {{discovered}} in 1984 by aerial photography carried out for Devon County Council. The earlier, smaller fort (the boundary ditches of which showed up in cropmarks) was later replaced by a second, larger fort. The ramparts of this second fort are preserved on two sides as modern field boundaries with substantial earthen banks with hedges on top. The banks on the other two sides were removed shortly before the site was recognised as Roman. The site was made a scheduled monument in 1986. The aerial photography also revealed two subsidiary military enclosures or annexes to each fort. In 1992 a <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> {{was made of the}} fort and areas to the east and west and this was followed by a trial excavation {{to the west of the}} site. These confirmed the existence of two forts, and the ditch of the second fort was excavated. Pottery from the site was dated from around 50–70 AD, which is consistent with a previous date of before 75 AD based on finds from fieldwalking. A Roman settlement near Shortlands Lane was excavated in 2009. A large quantity of Roman pottery, burial remains and fragments of hypocaust tile from the second and third century was found.|$|E

Evidence of settlement activity, however, was inconclusive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> can be {{used for}} various purposes. One is to study the {{bathymetry}} in the location of interest and to produce an image of the seafloor (irregularities, objects on the seabed, lateral variability, ice gouges, …). Seismic refraction surveys can be done to obtain information on shallow seabed stratigraphy - it {{can also be used to}} locate material such as sand and gravel for use in the construction of artificial islands. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> are conducted from a research vessel equipped with sonar devices and related equipment, such as single-beam and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, ‘towfish’ and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). For the sub-bottom stratigraphy, the tools used include boomers, sparkers, pingers and chirp. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> are normally required before conducting the geotechnical surveys; in larger projects, these phases may be interwoven.|$|R
