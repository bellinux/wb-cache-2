5|$|Angel is a {{proposed}} {{station on the}} Crossrail 2 (Chelsea-Hackney line) project, providing an interchange between Crossrail 2 and the Northern Line. Depending on the route constructed, it would be between King's Cross St. Pancras and Dalston Junction or Hackney Central. It was officially safeguarded {{as part of the}} route in 2007, although there had been proposals for a route for some time previously and safeguarding had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1991.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the start of the 2014–15 season, Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to {{assistant}} general manager, thus formalizing the de facto arrangement that had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 2013. Despite the front office changes, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39–31–12, resulting in a seventh-place finish in the Central Division.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for a route {{avoiding}} Central London {{had been}} <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. In 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade {{had built up}} schemes for new roads, including what became the North Circular Road, {{which was designed to}} skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support {{than their counterparts in}} England do.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the newly minted Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh War. Despite a cease-fire <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1994, Armenia has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Armenia became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E

5|$|In Granville, NY22 was {{originally}} routed on Quaker, Main, and North streets. It was rerouted {{in the mid-1960s}} to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village. NY149 was then extended northward along NY22's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville. From there, it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line, where it connected to VT30B, a spur route of VT30 that had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1935. Vermont renumbered VT30B to VT149 {{at this time to}} match the highway it now connected to in New York.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to {{maintain}} an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Amity Point boasts some of {{the largest}} shark numbers in the world, though shark attacks are rare, with only two {{recorded}} attacks. Despite the presence of shark drumlines, <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>since</b> 1997, a Brisbane woman was mauled to death by sharks while swimming in Rainbow Channel. The species of shark remains unknown, with bull sharks suspected by an expert and tiger sharks suggested by locals.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For {{most of the time}} since modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system has been changed several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over time, from the 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format has largely been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1968 as only small changes have been made since then, the last of which was in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{also saw the}} {{complete}} reconstruction of three important interchanges: The Rainbow Bridge Approach (later Highway420) in Niagara Falls, Highway20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton and Highway27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the QEW was opened in 1940. The third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with Highway27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway–freeway traffic movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|The station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, {{involving}} {{repair and}} {{restoration of the}} original glazed roof, so that platforms 9 to 12 inclusive can once more enjoy daylight. A false ceiling or crash deck had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an office block over {{that part of the}} station; Save Britain's Heritage successfully campaigned against this.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel {{as they had}} in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|Before Alma struck Florida, {{officials}} issued hurricane {{warnings from}} the Florida Keys through Apalachicola. A hurricane watch and gale warning were issued for the state's eastern coastline, extending to Savannah, Georgia. In Key West, residents boarded up houses, and about 1,000people {{fled to the}} region's 11shelters. The MIM-23 Hawk antiaircraft missiles in the city were moved to higher ground, having been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Further north, officials ordered the evacuation of Captiva Island and Sanibel Island. The causeways to Sanibel Island were closed, isolating residents who had not evacuated. Ten emergency shelters were opened in Fort Myers and two in Naples. Overall, about 100,000people were advised to seek shelter, though many of them chose {{to stay in their}} homes. All Phantom jet fighters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa were transported to Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, while aircraft were also evacuated from Homestead Air Reserve Base. Because Alma was initially forecast to cross the central portion of the state, residents along the Florida panhandle were not adequately prepared for the hurricane. Just hours before the storm moved ashore, officials ordered evacuations for residents in low-lying areas around Apalachicola.|$|E

5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army {{emerged from}} the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians {{emerged from the}} woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Cambodian {{conflict}} {{also brought}} an end the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, {{and the rest of}} Indochina, to gain admission into ASEAN. In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam. Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the post-Cold War era, when Soviet aid was no longer available. Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994. Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam’s isolation from the United States.|$|E
5|$|Turkey is {{a charter}} {{member of the}} UN, an early member of NATO, the IMF and the World Bank, and a {{founding}} member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's economy and diplomatic initiatives led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Turkey's current administration headed by president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has reversed many of the country's earlier reforms which had been <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>since</b> the founding of the modern republic of Turkey, such as Freedom of the Press, and a Legislative System of Checks and Balances. A set of standards for secularism in government, as first enacted by Atatürk have also diminished in favour of conservative religionist governance, to the grievance of much of the Turkish public.|$|E
