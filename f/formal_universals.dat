40|$|Human {{language}} is both highly diverse—different languages have {{different ways of}} achieving the same functional goals—and easily learnable. Any language allows its users to express virtually any thought they can conceptualize. These traits render human language unique in the biological world. Understanding the biological basis of {{language is}} thus both extremely challenging and fundamentally interesting. I review the literature on linguistic diversity and language universals, suggesting that an adequate notion of ‘formal universals’ provides a promising way to understand the facts of language acquisition, offering order {{in the face of}} the diversity of human languages. <b>Formal</b> <b>universals</b> are cross-linguistic generalizations, often of an abstract or implicational nature. They derive from cognitive capacities to perceive and process particular types of structures and biological constraints upon integration of the multiple systems involved in language. Such <b>formal</b> <b>universals</b> can be understood on the model of a general solution to a set of differential equations; each language is one particular solution. An explicit formal conception of human language that embraces both considerable diversity and underlying biological unity is possible, and fully compatible with modern evolutionary theory...|$|E

Based on Chomsky's derivation of a "universal grammar " (the set of essential, formal, and substantive traits of any hvman language), a number of hypothesized <b>formal</b> <b>universals</b> of clinically-relevant symbolic play were developed. In applying these hypothesized universals to dato representing the play activities of a five-year-old boy, a componential analysis (on which the dimensions underlying a set of individual meanings were extracted by pairwise comparisons of these meanings and their contextual attributes) was performed and then interpreted accordingly. It was noted that if different therapists performed a componential analysis on the raw data and organized the results of this analysis in the manner dictated by the hypothesized universals outlined in this paper, their interpretations would in all probability be both similar across interpreters and relatively valid.

All {{tests in}} psychometrics, {{comparative}} psychology and cognition {{which have been}} put into practice lack a mathematical (computational) foundation or lack the capability {{to be applied to}} any kind of system (humans, non-human animals, machines, hybrids, collectives, etc.).

40|$|AbstractSolomonoff unified Occam's razor and Epicurus’ {{principle}} of multiple explanations to one elegant, <b>formal,</b> <b>universal</b> theory of inductive inference, which initiated {{the field of}} algorithmic information theory. His central {{result is that the}} posterior of the universal semimeasure M converges rapidly to the true sequence generating posterior μ, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown μ. The first part of the paper investigates the existence and convergence of computable universal (semi) measures for a hierarchy of computability classes: recursive, estimable, enumerable, and approximable. For instance, M is known to be enumerable, but not estimable, and to dominate all enumerable semimeasures. We present proofs for discrete and continuous semimeasures. The second part investigates more closely the types of convergence, possibly implied by universality: in difference and in ratio, with probability 1, in mean sum, and for Martin-Löf random sequences. We introduce a generalized concept of randomness for individual sequences and use it to exhibit difficulties regarding these issues. In particular, we show that convergence fails (holds) on generalized-random sequences in gappy (dense) Bernoulli classes...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} a {{particular}} notion of rationality, more exactly a specific notion of legitimate inference, is presupposed by much work in the social sci-ences to their detriment. The author describes the notion of rationality he has in mind, explains why it is misguided, identifies where and how it affects social research, and illustrates why that research is weaker as a result. The notion of legitimate inference the author has in mind is one that believes inferences are guided by principles that are <b>formal,</b> <b>universal</b> and a priori—that is, that make no substantive, domain-specific empirical assumptions about the world. The author briefly provides {{a variety of reasons}} to be skeptical about such principles. Those reasons extend from broad philosophical considerations to quasi-empirical evidence. The author then argues that this notion of inference is involved with both the practice and the content of the social sciences in various ways. In terms of practice, this notion of inference lies behind the way statistical testing is generally done in the social sciences. In terms of content, the author argues that this notion of rationality is invoked, for example, in game theory an...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This thesis {{sets out}} to cover the matter of {{leadership}} as it is informed by science, art, and philosophy. The research involved entails a corresponding consideration of the sensibility and intelligibility, morality and ethics of leadership along with accounts of {{their relationship to the}} notion of the mature human intellect as well as to that of the idea of a university. Scope: The work proposes that the transcendental intellect is the ground for notions and principles of leadership. Opting for a schema of the universe of the intellect over a Kantian model of the faculties of the intellect, the notion of leadership can be clearly seen to belong not in the general intellect of science, made up of understanding and reason, but in a transcendental intellect comprised of comprehension and judgement. A science of leadership is a contested idea because it does not and cannot take into account values and ends, {{regardless of whether or not}} those values are based on <b>formal</b> <b>universal</b> principles or on particular substantive judgments. The human understanding is the only intellectual grounds for a science of leadership and a critique of those grounds could be reinforced by a similar treatment of human reason being the grounds for the art of leadership.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a cross-linguistic {{investigation into}} the structure and interpretation of imperatives and related constructions. We identify universal morphosyntactic principles of imperatives and explain variations in the syntax of imperatives {{as a consequence of}} the interaction between the universal principles and the morphosyntactic system of a particular language. Based on these conclusions, we develop a model for the interpretation of imperatives. We show that the syntax of imperatives across languages includes an imperative operator, which is a set of morphosyntactic features. The interaction between a <b>formal</b> <b>universal</b> for the imperative operator and the syntax of a language correctly predicts the cross-linguistic variation in the availability of negative imperatives. We also account for the apparent peculiarity in the syntactic evolution of imperatives in the history of English. The results of our analysis confirm the postulated presence of an imperative operator and provide support for the presence of particular functional projections in the clausal phrase structure in English. We also propose that the morphosyntactic features of the imperative operator have interpretational consequences. We argue that the imperative operator includes a feature that encodes directive force, and another feature that encodes modality of unrealized interpretation. We also argue that subjunctives and infinitivals have an operator whose feature content is in a proper subset relation with that o...|$|R
