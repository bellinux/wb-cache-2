500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with {{a tone of}} incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> should {{be some sort of}} national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E

2500|$|Van Vliet's {{arrival in}} Salt Lake City was welcomed {{cautiously}} by the Mormon leadership. Van Vliet {{had been previously}} known by the Latter-day Saints in Iowa, and they trusted and respected him. However, he found the residents of Utah determined to defend themselves. He interviewed leaders and townspeople and [...] "...attended Sunday services, heard emotional speeches, and saw the Saints raise their hands in a unanimous resolution to guard against any 'invader.'" [...] Van Vliet {{found it impossible to}} persuade resentful Mormon leaders that the Army had peaceful intentions. He quickly recognized that supplies or accommodations for the Army would not be forthcoming. But Young told Van Vliet that the Mormons did not desire war, and [...] "if we can keep the peace for this winter I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be something turned up that may save the shedding of blood." [...] However, marking a change from earlier pronouncements, Young declared that under threat from an approaching army he would not allow the new governor and federal officers to enter Utah. Nevertheless, Van Vliet told Young that he believed that the Mormons [...] "have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw." [...] He promised to stop the Utah Expedition on his own authority, and on September 14 he returned east through the Mormon fortifications then being built in Echo Canyon (see below).|$|E

60|$|Life in Moscow, as {{compared}} to life in London, is drab, monotonous, and depressed. I am not, of course, comparing life there {{with that of the}} rich here, but with that of the average working-class family. When it is realized that the highest wages are about fifteen shillings a month, this is not surprising. I do not think that life could, under any system, be very cheerful in a country so exhausted by war as Russia, so I am not saying this as a criticism of the Bolsheviks. But I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> might be less police interference, less vexatious regulation, and more freedom for spontaneous impulses towards harmless enjoyments.|$|E

I am no stranger, to that which men call justice, and know how to honor and respect its decrees as they deserve. Justice, Signori, is the weak man's scourge and the strong man's sword: it is a breast-plate and back-plate to the one and a weapon to be parried by the other. In short, it is a word of fair import, on the tongue, but of most unequal application in the deed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{confess that}} I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a disparity, {{too great a}} disparity, and in a point no less {{essential}} than mind. I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more. He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise. Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, {{it would have been}} another thing. But I have no reason to suppose it so. It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me. A man like him, in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment. A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman. He ought not; he does not." ...|$|E

However, to return to the countess: I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> ought to be more mixture of classes in England, and somebody told me'--this was a violent effort to be literary on Hilda's part, by way of rising to the height of the occasion--'somebody told me that Mr. Matthew Arnold, who's so dreadfully satirical, and cultivated, and so forth, thinks exactly the same thing, you know. Why shouldn't the Countess of Coalbrookdale have really married the foreman of the colliers? I daresay she'd have been a great deal happier with a kind-hearted sensible man like him than with that lumbering, hunting, pheasant-shooting, horse-racing lout of a Lord Coalbrookdale, who would go to Norway on a fishing tour without her--now wouldn't she?' ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--They tell me {{your health}} is not strong. Man, {{come out here and}} try the Prophet's chamber. There's only one bad point to us--we do rise early. The Amanuensis states that you are a lover of silence--and that ours is a noisy house--and she is a chatterbox--I am not {{answerable}} for these statements, though I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is a touch of garrulity about my premises. We have so little to talk about, you see. The house is three miles from town, in the midst of great silent forests. There is a burn close by, and when we are not talking you can hear the burn, and the birds, and the sea breaking on the coast three miles away and six hundred feet below us, and about three times a month a bell--I don't know where the bell is, nor who rings it; it may be the bell in Hans Andersen's story for all I know. It is never hot here--86 in the shade is about our hottest--and it is never cold except just in the early mornings. Take it for all in all, I suppose this island climate to be by far the healthiest in the world--even the influenza entirely lost its sting. Only two patients died, and one was a man nearly eighty, and the other a child below four months. I won't tell you if it is beautiful, for I want you to come here and see for yourself. Everybody on the premises except my wife has some Scotch blood in their veins--I beg your pardon--except the natives--and then my wife is a Dutchwoman--and the natives are the next thing conceivable to Highlanders before the forty-five. We would have some grand cracks! ...|$|E
60|$|Bun. Sir, said I, let {{me answer}} you in a similitude: Set the case that, at such a wood corner, there did usually come forth thieves, to do mischief; must there {{therefore}} a law be made that every one that cometh out there shall be killed? May there not come out true men as well as thieves out from thence? Just thus {{it is in this}} case; I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> may be many that may design the destruction of the commonwealth; but it does not follow therefore that all private meetings are unlawful; those that transgress, let them be punished. And if at any time I myself should do any act in my conversation as doth not become a man and Christian, let me bear the punishment. And as for your saying I may meet in public, if I may be suffered, I would gladly do it. Let me have but meeting enough in public, and I shall care the less to have them in private. I do not meet in private because I am afraid to have meetings in public. I bless the Lord that my heart is at that point, that if any man can lay anything to my charge, either in doctrine or practice, in this particular, that can be proved error or heresy, I am willing to disown it, even in the very market place; but if it be truth, then to stand to it to the last drop of my blood. And, Sir, said I, you ought to commend me for so doing. To err and to be a heretic are two things; I am no heretic, because I will not stand refractorily to defend any one thing that is contrary to the Word. Prove anything which I hold to be an error, and I will recant it.|$|E
