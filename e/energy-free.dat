In this paper, the problems addressed are speed, size, and error rate. The speed problem simply vanishes, as it was an inference from the implicit assumption that the logic would be electronic. But the other two problems are real and must be addressed if <b>energy-free</b> logic is to have any significant applications.

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} {{of living}} cells contains {{many types of}} crosslinkers. Some crosslinkers allow <b>energy-free</b> rotations between filaments and others do not. The mechanical interplay between these different crosslinkers is an open issue in cytoskeletal mechanics. Therefore, we develop a theoretical framework based on rigidity percolation to study a generic filamentous system containing both stretching and bond-bending forces to address this issue. The framework involves both analytical calculations via effective medium theory and numerical simulations on a percolating triangular lattice with very good agreement between both. We find that the introduction of angle-constraining crosslinkers to a semiflexible filamentous network with freely rotating crosslinks can cooperatively lower the onset of rigidity to the connectivity percolation threshold-a result argued for years but never before obtained via effective medium theory. This allows the system to ultimately attain rigidity at the lowest concentration of material possible. We further demonstrate that introducing angle-constraining crosslinks results in mechanical behaviour similar to just freely rotating crosslinked semflexible filaments, indicating redundancy and universality. Our results also impact upon collagen and fibrin networks in biological and bio-engineered tissues...|$|E

The relay {{is assumed to}} be <b>energy-free</b> and needs to harvest energy from the source node. By embedding power splitting (PS) at each relay antenna to coordinate the received energy and information, joint problem of determining PS ratios and power allocation at the multi-antenna relay node is formulated to maximize the end-to-end achievable rate. We show that the multi-antenna relay is equivalent to a virtual single-antenna relay in such a SWIPT system, and the problem is optimally solved with closed-form. To reduce the hardware cost of the PS scheme, we further propose the antenna clustering scheme, where the multiple antennas at the relay are partitioned into two disjoint groups which are exclusively used for information decoding and energy harvesting, respectively. Optimal clustering algorithm is first proposed but with exponential complexity. Then a greedy clustering algorithms is introduced with linear complexity and approaching to the optimal performance.

The anatomy of the pelvic fossae is presented, including the recto-vesical pouch (pouch of Douglas) created by the reflections of the peritoneum. The actual technique of the trans-Douglas, intrafascial nerve-sparing robotic radical prostatectomy is described. The technique allows the prostate gland to be shelled out from under the overlying detrusor apron and dorsal vascular complex (DVC-Santorini plexus), entirely avoiding the pubovesical ligaments. There is no need to control the DVC, since the line of dissection passes beneath the plexus. Three key points to ensure enhanced nerve preservation should be respected: (1) the tips of the seminal vesicles, enclosed in a "cage" of neuronal tissue; a seminal vesicle-sparing technique is therefore advised when oncologically safe; (2) the external prostate-vesicular angle; (3) the lateral surface of the prostate gland and the apex. The principles of tension and <b>energy-free</b> dissection should guide all the maneuvers in order to minimize neuropathy.

Retrospective analysis of cross-sectional dietary intake data using a representative sample of LMD adults (n= 1, 689). Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index- 2005 (HEI- 2005) scores that were computed using the population ratio method. The effects of substituting SSBs with water on diet quality were simulated by replacing the targeted items&#x 2019; nutrient profile with tap water&#x 0027;s profile. Simulating the replacement of SSBs with tap water at 25, 50, and 100 % levels resulted in 1 -, 2. 3 -, and 3. 8 -point increases, respectively, in the HEI- 2005 total score. Based on a mean daily intake of 2, 011 kcal, 100 % substitution of SSBs with tap water would result in 11 % reduction in energy intake.

In addition, mTOR co-localised with Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (eIF 3 F) at the cell membrane post-exercise in both groups, with the response significantly greater at 1 h of recovery in the FED compared to CON.

40|$|Stress-induced {{martensitic}} {{transformation in}} single crystals and polycrystals are examined {{on the basis}} of micromechanics. A simple method to find a stress- and elastic <b>energy-free</b> martensite plate (combined variant), which consists of two variants, is presented. External and internal stresses preferentially produce a combined variant, to which the stresses supply the largest work upon its formation. Using the chemical energy change with temperature, the phase boundary between the parent and martensitic phases is determined in stress-temperature diagrams. The method is extended to a polycrystal, modeled as an aggregate of spherical grains. The grains constitute axisymmetric multiple fiber textures and a uniaxial load is applied to the fiber axis. The occurrence and progress of transformation are followed by examining a stress state in the grains. The stress is the sum of the external stress and internal stress. The difference in the fraction of transformation and, thus, in transformation strains between the grains causes the internal stress, which is calculated with the average field method. After a short transition stage, all the grains start to transform, and the external uniaxial stress to continue the transformation increases linearly thereafter. The external stress {{at the end of the}} transition is defined as the macroscopic yield stress due to the transformation in polycrystals. The yield stress tends to saturate, as the number of the textures increases...|$|E
40|$|We utilize neutron {{diffraction}} techniques to study dynamical correlation of protons in the ionic crystal of {{potassium hydrogen carbonate}} (KHCO 3). Protons are found in small planar centrosymmetric dimer entities, (HCO− 3) 2, linked by moderately strong hydrogen bonds and well separated by the stacking of potassium atoms. There is no disordering at low temperature and rods of diffuse scattering in (a∗, c∗) planes, not observed for KDCO 3, reveal macroscopic entanglement. We propose a theoretical framework for the degenerate lattice of indistinguishable protons, treated as fermions. Entangled centrosymmetric pairs are superpositions of singlet-like and triplet-like pseudoproton states and the sublattice is a superposition of nonlocal macroscopic single-pseudoproton states, adiabatically separated from the lattice of heavy atoms. The sublattice has no internal dynamics (super-rigidity) and is decoherence free. The <b>energy-free</b> quantum entanglement {{is a consequence of}} the crystal structure, irrespective of proton–proton interaction. The differential cross-section calculated for the super-rigid lattice accounts for the observed rods of intensity. Between 150 and 300 K, protons are progressively transferred to secondary sites at ≈ 0. 6 A ̊ from the main position, via tunnelling along hydrogen bonds. Quantum entanglement, still observed at 300 K, indicates that proton transfer is a thermally activated coherent superposition of macroscopic tunnelling states.

Their particulate (as opposed to molecular) nature allows designing multifunctional platforms via the binding of molecular determinants, including targeting molecules and chemotherapy drugs, thereby facilitating their localization at the desired site. The intrinsic activity of nanomaterials with pharmacological potential include peculiar trans-excitation reactions that render them able to transform radiofrequency, UV, visible or infrared radiations into cytocidal reactive oxygen species or heat, thereby inducing local cytotoxity in selected areas. The use of such devices has been shown to improve the efficacy of antitumor chemo- and radio-therapies, increasing the selectivity of the cytocidal effects, and reducing systemic side effects.

The proposed system consists of a PV panel, storage system, LED lamp, power conditioning system (PCS) and the controller which can manage the power direction and system operation. Using LED in lighting applications has many advantages compared to other lamp. It is very efficient (very high efficiency lighting source) and cost effective (the life time is very long compare to other lamps). In additions to, it needs low dc voltage source to be operated. The storage system will be charged during the day time using the available sunlight. On the other hand, during the night time the controller will give a signal to the system to connect the LED lamp to be ready for use. Since the LED needs a low dc voltage to be operated, so a simple dc-dc converter will be enough for this system resulting in decreasing the cost of the overall system.

This study addresses the following questions: 1) how much extra metabolic energy is associated with traveling a unit distance by adopting acceleration/deceleration cycles in walking and running, with respect to constant speed, and 2) how can biomechanics explain those metabolic findings. Ten males and ten females walked and ran at fluctuating speeds (5 ± 0, ± 1, ± 1. 5, ± 2, ± 2. 5 km/h for treadmill walking, 11 ± 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ± 4 km/h for treadmill and field running) in cycles lasting 6 s. Field experiments, consisting of subjects following a laser spot projected from a computer-controlled astronomic telescope, were necessary to check the noninertial bias of the oscillating-speed treadmill. Metabolic cost of transport was found to be almost constant at all speed oscillations for running and up to ± 2 km/h for walking, with no remarkable differences between laboratory and field results. The substantial constancy of the metabolic cost is not explained by the predicted cost of pure acceleration/deceleration. As for walking, results from speed-oscillation running suggest that the inherent within-stride, elastic <b>energy-free</b> accelerations/decelerations when moving at constant speed work as a mechanical buffer for among-stride speed fluctuations, with no extra metabolic cost. Also, a recent theory about the analogy between sprint (level) running and constant-speed running on gradients, together with the mechanical determinants of gradient locomotion, helps to interpret the present findings...|$|E
40|$|The face {{of physics}} is a {{function}} of scale. This widespread phrase is considered as a universal truth because it reflects the experience of generations of physicists. Starting from primary school we know that the physics of macroscopic solid state systems rests on the notion that these systems consist of a great number of spatially periodic microscopic building blocks. Thus, it seems to be quite logic to expect the same properties from geometrically identical macroscopic regions of the same macroscopic system. The above statement is quite general and it is also known to be valid for the systems of a reduced dimensionality in the direction, along which they are macroscopic. However, in this work we report on a macroscopic system, which does not obey the above postulates and demonstrates specific quantum behaviour on a macroscopic length. It is conventional quantum Hall system possessing an asymmetric confining potential in presence of a tilted quantizing magnetic field. In the direction, along which the system is macroscopic, it demonstrates the following unusual properties: (i) a spatially-dependent response on a spatially-homogeneous photo-excitation that implies spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry (ii) high sensitivity of a local photo-response to the conditions of macroscopically remote local regions (iii) excitation of whole system through the excitation of its local region without an appropriate energy transfer within the system. All these properties imply the electron coherent length to be as high as the macroscopic sample length.

The analysis {{is carried out}} using a detailed model of a biomass gasification CHP plant developed with Aspen Plus. The model describes: wood drying and gasification in a dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactor, syngas cleaning, as well as combustion in a gas engine for electricity production. Heat is recovered from the CHP system for internal needs and for district and domestic water heating. An accurate prediction of tar and inorganic contaminants is developed for proper modeling of syngas cleaning efficiency. The influence of wood moisture content, drying conditions, flow rate of the sand circulating in the DFB reactor, catalyst and scrubbing agent efficiencies, as well as additional electricity production through steam turbine on the overall process performances is studied. On the basis of the comparative analysis of nine case studies, it is found that the highest energetic efficiencies are obtained when forced drying is not implemented in the CHP system. Lowering the inlet wood moisture content with natural drying (<b>energy-free)</b> prior to the CHP plant improves the electrical efficiency. An overall energeticefficiency of 74 % (23 % electric, 51 % thermal; based on the lower heating value of wood on anhydrous basis) is then reached with wood fed at 30 % moisture content. The best exergetic efficiency is reached when wood (naturally dried to 30 %) is dried further to 15 % by forced drying in the CHP plant and when some of the high-temperature heat is recovered for electricity production via steam turbine instead of district heating. In this case, the overall energetic efficiency is 63 % (32 % electric, 31 % thermal). This model is a useful tool to assess process design improvements and life cycle inventory...|$|E

Potential applications include roving or hovering surveillance and communication utilities for both military and commercial use, {{and a variety}} of remotesensing instruments for the scientific community. In particular, the Missile Defense Agency plans to utilize unmanned airships at high-altitudes to provide a long-duration missile defense presence around the coast-line of the United States. Operated at 70 kft, each of these “high altitude airships ” will fly above all regulated air-traffic for several months to years, will reside in a steady atmospheric regime, and will utilize solar energy to provide all required power. Two key objectives for this type of mission are that the unmanned airship have exceptionally long endurance, and that it operate with a sufficiently high-level of autonomy. In order to achieve these objectives, a robust guidance and control system is required, capable of auto-piloting and controlling the airship under an extremely wide range of atmospheric and wind conditions. The successful design of such a system first requires an accurate model of airship dynamics across its expansive flight envelope, and a representative model of the expected disturbances. The dynamics of an airship are markedly different from traditional aircraft, with significant effects from added mass and inertia, and a much higher sensitivity to wind. In this paper, a typical airship configuration is first sized to meet energy balance and mass constraints. The geometry of this configuration is then used to develop a general aerodynamic model for the airship. The equations of motion with added mass and inertia are developed, and the open-loop dynamics are analyzed across a range of flight conditions.

In 1983, Richter and Knoche proposed reversible combustion, which utilized both the oxidation and reduction of metal. Metal associated with its oxidized form as an oxygen carrier was circulated between two reactors [...] oxidizer and reducer. In the reducer, the solid oxygen carrier reacts with the fuel to produce CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }O and elemental metal only. Pure CO{sub 2 } will be obtained in the exit gas stream from the reducer after H{sub 2 }O is condensed. The pure CO{sub 2 } is ready for subsequent sequestration. In the oxidizer, the elemental metal reacts with air to form metal oxide and separate oxygen from nitrogen. Only nitrogen and some unused oxygen are emitted from the oxidizer. The advantage of CLC compared to normal combustion is that CO{sub 2 } is not diluted with nitrogen but obtained in a relatively pure form without any energy needed for separation. In addition to the <b>energy-free</b> purification of CO{sub 2 }, the CLC process also provides two other benefits. First, NO{sub x} formation can be largely eliminated. Secondly, the thermal efficiency of a CLC system is very high. Presently, the CLC process has only been used with natural gas. An oxygen carrier based on an energy balance analysis and thermodynamics analysis was selected. Copper (Cu) {{seems to be the}} best choice for the CLC system for solid fuels. From this project, the mechanisms of CuO reduction by solid fuels may be as follows: (1) If pyrolysis products of solid fuels are available, reduction of CuO could start at about 400 C or less. (2) If pyrolysis products of solid fuels are unavailable and the reduction temperature is lower, reduction of CuO could occur at an onset temperature of about 500 C, char gasification reactivity in CO{sub 2 } was lower at lower temperatures. (3) If pyrolysis products of solid fuels are unavailable and the reduction temperature is higher than 750 C, all reaction reactivities were improved, especially the CO{sub 2 } gasification reactivity of char. Thus, the reduction of CuO by the gasification product CO could proceed quickly. Based on the results obtained, the following coal characteristics would be desirable for the Chemical Looping Combustion process: high volatile matter with a high reactivity of the char produced. PRB coal meets these criteria while being comparatively less expensive and also very abundant. The high moisture content present in PRB coal might also increase the reactivity for char gasification through the development of pore structure and specific surface area in the char during pyrolysis. Biomass materials are also suitable, considering the reaction mechanism of CLC system of solid fuels. The feasibility of the chemical looping combustion process of solid fuels was verified by focusing on PRB coal and biomass. Based on PRB coal as the preferred solid fuel {{in the development of the}} CLC system, the mass, energy and system in a dual reactor recirculation system has been determined. In the Cu oxidation tests, it was confirmed that the heating rate is the most important effect on the Cu oxidation process. Lower heating rates and lower operational temperatures would result in incomplete conversion of Cu to CuO. Cu{sub 2 }O may be the intermediate product. The operating temperature did not affect the reaction rate of the oxidation process. Under any operating conditions, the exothermic properties are clearly shown...|$|E
