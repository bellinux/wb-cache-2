5|$|Prior to Debra's {{arrival in}} Texas, {{numerous}} hurricane warnings were issued {{and at least}} 8,600individuals evacuated. Torrential rains were produced in southeastern Texas, which led to widespread flooding on highways. Sea vessels took {{the brunt of the}} storm, with many having become stranded or damaged. Forms of transportation such as air, rail, and road were significantly interrupted or even shut down. High winds from the storm caused expansive damage to buildings, windows, signs, and roofs. The hurricane resulted in 11injuries but no deaths, and approximately 90cattle drowned. Damage in Texas' Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties surmounted $6.685million, and total damage from the storm reached $7million. In the aftermath, the Weather Bureau was criticized for the lack of warning; the bureau's chief, Stephen Lichtblau, maintained that it was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> any warnings were issued, and those that were had been delivered in a timely manner.|$|E
5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which many thought unacceptable {{for a woman to}} bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.|$|E

25|$|A {{development}} {{that had not}} been foreseen was the emergence of the Monklands iron industry, which generated a huge demand for good quality iron ore and coal, and the Caledonian was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> considerable reserves lay in areas served by it, or otherwise accessible over it.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the choice of {{high-end}} dresses {{turning out to be}} a correct decision, Sir Alan and Nick expressed the view that Raef had been <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> it had turned out that way, since his choice had not taken into account any business justification outside of the high price.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> the urea {{conversion}} {{reaction is}} slow—because {{if it were}} not it would go into reverse in the stripper. As it is, succeeding stages of the process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the temperature reduces {{to the point where the}} reversion reaction is very slow.|$|E

25|$|According to Kristine Layfield, the CBC {{executive}} director of network programming, it was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> the show had aired on January 7, 2008, whilst the Writers Guild of America-led strikes continued in the United States, as it would give the audience something different from watch, especially if CBC Television benefited from the strikes to gain more viewers.|$|E
25|$|With {{its back}} to the Negev Desert {{following}} their defeat at the Second Battle of Gaza, the EEF had been <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman forces did not launch a large-scale counter-attack, as such an attack would likely succeeded in pushing the EEF back a considerable distance. Regardless, the EEF faced the urgent problems of securing the positions it held {{at the end of}} the battle, and reorganising and reinforcing its severely depleted infantry divisions.|$|E
25|$|At 06:45 on 6 November, LCAs landing Nos. 40 and 42 Commando {{touched down}} at Port Said. The water here was {{particularly}} shallow as the beach shelved gently and the Commandos, having {{to wade through}} such a wide water gap, were perhaps <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> LVT amphibians also participated in the landing. Still, the LCA crews had done exactly what was required of them - landing the assault force on target and on time. The weather and sea conditions had cooperated; north-easterly winds blew up over the next eight hours {{that would have made}} the landing less accurate (and by the next morning impossible).|$|E

25|$|The National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution {{contains}} (among other things) the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) certified proofs and the Treasury Department {{collection of}} United States currency. Using {{a combination of}} proofs and issued notes, a nearly complete type set of high-denomination currency was compiled. Notably missing are several types of Compound and Interest Bearing Notes. Printed during the early to mid-1860s on very thin paper, these high-denomination notes are virtually non-existent. Their issuance (1861–65) pre-dates the BEP's responsibility for U.S. Currency (1870s), so it is <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> any proofs exist in the current archives.|$|E
25|$|It {{proved to}} be tremendously <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> these events had taken place, as during the 4th quarter of that game in Cincinnati Lloyd Barker {{attempted}} a bicycle kick and landed awkwardly, breaking his neck. The story of the insurance gaffe and Barkers injury became national news overnight. After surgery and several days in traction, Barker did recover from his injuries, and {{with the aid of}} a neck brace he made a tearful appearance at a game later in the season. After significant rehab Barker did eventually make a comeback, and suited up for the Detroit Rockers, though he never recaptured his earlier form.|$|E
25|$|It {{turned out}} however that Siam {{was not his}} {{greatest}} adversary. It was the remote mountainous states like Lan Xang, Mohnyin and Mogaung whose guerrilla warfare gave him constant trouble. Many of his men died from starvation and disease while fruitlessly searching for elusive bands of rebels, year after year. (The death toll must have been significant since it {{made it to the}} chronicles.) He was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> a charismatic guerrilla leader like Setthathirath died. In the end, his military might alone could not bring lasting peace. He needed competent local rulers, who commanded respect of the local populace, to rule the lands on his behalf. History shows that he used the political solution instead to maintain peace.|$|E

25|$|Although it is <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> {{the second}} {{performance}} survives from {{an era when}} little television was preserved, the play is well known only amongst archive television enthusiasts and science fiction fans. It was twenty-three years before it received a repeat broadcast in 1977. Another proposed repeat {{as part of the}} BBC's fiftieth anniversary of television celebrations in 1986 was overruled by the producers of the 1984 John Hurt/Richard Burton feature film, who felt that earlier versions would affect income for their film. The BBC was permitted to show the play again in 1994 on BBC Two, as a tribute to the recently deceased Cartier and again in June 2003 on digital station BBC Four as part of the George Orwell centenary celebrations.|$|E
25|$|Even at {{the peak}} of its might, the Toungoo {{military}} had the most difficult time controlling remote hill states. They never solved the sheer logistical issues of transporting and feeding large numbers of troops for sustained periods of time. Bayinnaung's persistence in sending troops year after year cost an untold number of lives, which at one point caused his senior advisers to murmur loudly. The conqueror king was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> a charismatic guerrilla leader like King Setthathirath of Lan Xang (r. 1548–72) was assassinated by a local rival. After Bayinnaung, Lower Burma lost the manpower advantage over a far more populous Siam. Ayutthaya's larger, well-equipped armies not only repulsed Nanda's undermanned invasions but also ended up seizing the Tenasserim coast in the process.|$|E
25|$|The Germans withdrew several {{units from}} Luftflotte 1. JG 53 {{headed back to}} Germany leaving JG 54 as the air fleet's only fighter unit and Fliegerkorps VIII was given back to Kesselring for the Moscow offensive. The VVS North-Western Front was reduced {{to the size of}} a division, with only 191 {{aircraft}} on strength by the 22 September. It had sustained 1,283 combat losses including 749 in the air. On the Northern Front (including the arctic), total losses amounted to 2,692 since 22 June. Only 450 replacements had reached the line. Several divisions, including the 2 BAD and 41 SAD were almost destroyed. It was <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> Soviet intelligence correctly determined that the Germans were abandoning the Leningrad offensive, and moving their armour to the central sector. It was decided that Moscow was the more vulnerable city, so the Red Army and VVS concentrated its greatest resources there.|$|E

50|$|They {{were also}} <b>fortunate</b> in <b>that</b> finance was {{becoming}} less difficult {{to raise and}} the city's rating base had by the 1960s significantly grown, {{to the point where}} revenue streams were sufficient to absorb the considerable capital outlays.|$|R
60|$|It was a <b>fortunate</b> thing <b>that</b> we {{went into}} the library, for the first thing Montgomery saw on the table was the half inch of cio-root which he thought had killed him. He had {{forgotten}} to take it.|$|R
25|$|In 1578, Montaigne, whose health {{had always}} been excellent, started {{suffering}} from painful kidney stones, a sickness he had inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would {{have nothing to do}} with doctors or drugs. From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at Bagni di Lucca where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto, to which he presented a silver relief depicting himself and his wife and daughter kneeling before the Madonna, considering himself <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> it should be hung on a wall within the shrine. He kept a fascinating journal recording regional differences and customs and a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the stones he succeeded in ejecting from his bladder. This was published much later, in 1774, after its discovery in a trunk which is displayed in his tower.|$|E
25|$|The town is <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> the Christchurch Priory cartulary, which {{consists}} of over 1,300 documents and charters copied and collated in the 14th century, with a few later additions, has survived to provide a comprehensive account of the Priory and events connected to it during the medieval period. A full translation was published in 2007. The evolution of the Priory into the building it is today took place over many centuries: The nave and transepts are Norman with heavy columns and round arches, whereas the lady chapel is from the 14th century and more Perpendicular in style. The great choir is even later, having been rebuilt in the 16th Century. The Priory is noted for its Miraculous Beam, which attracts pilgrims {{from all over the}} world. From the reign of Edward I, after mass on Sundays, the church wardens supervised the archery practice that all men were obliged to undertake. This event took place on a piece of unconsecrated land between the north porch and transept. The requirement for the men of the town to practise archery continued until Tudor times.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the bridge was built, {{engineers}} had not discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s, well {{after the collapse of}} the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, in 1940. It is therefore <b>fortunate</b> <b>that</b> the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many of the bridges built around the same time have vanished or been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor J. Lloyd Haigh—by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed to stand, with the addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. They turned out to be unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.|$|E
2500|$|The French Aviation Militaire was <b>fortunate</b> in <b>that</b> {{they were}} able to {{standardise}} on two reasonably satisfactory synchronization gears – one adapted for rotary engines, and the other for [...] "stationary" [...] (in-line) ones – almost from the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hexagonal}} grid does not suffer as large anisotropy troubles {{as those that}} plague the HPP square grid model, a <b>fortunate</b> fact <b>that</b> is not entirely obvious, and that prompted Frisch to remark that [...] "the symmetry gods are benevolent".|$|R
5000|$|... is also {{applicable}} to second order reactions {{that may not}} be concerted reactions. Guldberg and Waage were <b>fortunate</b> in <b>that</b> reactions such as ester formation and hydrolysis, on which they originally based their theory, do indeed follow this rate expression.|$|R
