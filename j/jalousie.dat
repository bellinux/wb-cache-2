25|$|Some of the {{highlights}} of the house's architecture include the flat-roofed turret and the monumental and richly decorated facade. The tin-covered mansard roof has a wooden construction and the house's brick walls are supported by the original wooden beams. The <b>jalousie</b> windows also feature wooden frames.|$|E
25|$|At {{the ground}} level, a pink-stone plinth {{serves as a}} podium for the one story eclectic pilasters at {{the north and south}} {{extremes}} of the facade and for the two caryatids, which flank the main entrance and define the three bays of the facade. The central entrance arch cuts the podium and houses intricately carved hardwood doors and a stained-glass fanlight protected by decorative wrought iron railings. Bays 1 and 3 both consist of paired arches, located above the podium and articulated in an ionic pilaster order. Each arch-window houses folding <b>jalousie</b> shutters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the upper}} level there are four Ionic pilasters with {{pedestals}} resting on a continuous horizontal string-course. The three openings are symmetrically arranged and equally proportioned and articulated: a simple surround with a keystone frames a wide arch, opening out to a balcony through wooden <b>jalousie</b> doors. Decoratively etched clear glass lights occupy the tympanym over each opening. The first and third bay balconies contain waist-high decorative cast-iron railings and the wider central balcony consists of stone balusters and rails supported by the caryatid figures of the ground floor. A full-entablature cornice and solid parapet cap the facade composition. Roman-style amphorae on the parapet, above each pilaster, serve as finials for each bay division.|$|E
500|$|Descriptions of Bette {{are often}} {{connected}} to savagery and animal imagery. Her name, for example, is a homophone in French for [...] "" [...] ("beast"). One passage explains that [...] "elle ressemblait aux singes habillés en femmes" [...] ("she sometimes {{looked like one}} of those monkeys in petticoats"); elsewhere her voice is described as having [...] "une <b>jalousie</b> de tigre" [...] ("tiger-like jealousy"). Her beastly rage comes to the surface with ferocity when she learns of Steinbock's engagement to Hortense: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} season, Copeau kept his promises. He staged plays from the classics, fairly recent works of quality, and the offerings of new playwrights {{from outside the}} theatre such as Jean Schlumberger and Roger Martin du Gard. The Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier was inaugurated with a little {{ceremony}} on 22 October 1913 and opened with its first public performance on the next evening with Heywood's A Woman Killed By Kindness ("Une femme tuée par la douceur"), but the Elizabethan melodrama did not impress the critics and the public remained indifferent. Molière's Amour médecin, however, received a more promising reception. The Schlumberger offering, Les Fils Louverné ("The Louverné Sons"), a rather austere drama about sibling conflict, was followed by Alfred de Musset's Barberine, a delightfully poetic piece that charmed the public and showed off the talents of the young company on a bare stage. Dullin triumphed in his signature interpretation of Harpagon in Molière's L’Avare ("The Miser") and the troupe showed its physical dexterity in Molière's farce, La <b>Jalousie</b> du Barbouillé ("The Jealous Barbouillé").|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} season, Vieux-Colombier in New York staged twenty-one {{different}} plays. Among them were ten plays {{from the first}} season in Paris but with a different casts since not all the original members of the troupe came to New York: Molière's La <b>Jalousie</b> du Barbouillé, L'Avare and L'Amour médecin, Musset's Barberine, the Copeau/Croué adaptation of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, and Nuit des rois, the adaptation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night shared the stage with Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement ("The Carriage of the Holy Sacrament") of Prosper Mérimée, La Surprise de l'Amour ("Love's [...] Surprise") of Musset, and Poil de Carotte ("Carrot Head") of Jules Renard. As during the first season, a mixture of both classic and modern plays, some by living authors, served {{as the basis of}} the repertoire. At the close of the New York season, Copeau took his troupe to Washington, D.C. and to the Little Theatre in Philadelphia where they presented ten different plays. In early May, they performed L'Avare at Vassar College to close their season.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, after {{a second}} year at Saint Anne's Clinique de Maladies Mentales et de l'Encéphale, Lacan became a {{licensed}} forensic psychiatrist. In 1932 {{he was awarded the}} [...] (roughly equivalent to an M.D. degree) for his thesis On Paranoiac Psychosis in its Relations to the Personality (De la Psychose paranoïaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité suivi de Premiers écrits sur la paranoïa; Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1975). It had a limited reception in the 1930s because it was not published until four decades later, but it did find acclaim, especially by surrealist artists. This thesis is thought to mark Lacan's entry into psychoanalysis. It shows Lacan’s dissatisfaction with traditional psychiatry and the growing influence of Sigmund Freud on his works. ‘Paranoid Psychosis and its Relation to the Personality’ was based on observations of several patients with a primary focus on one female patient whom Lacan called Aimee. Also in 1932, Lacan translated Freud's 1922 text, [...] "Über einige neurotische Mechanismen bei Eifersucht, Paranoia und Homosexualität" [...] ("Some Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality") as [...] "De quelques mécanismes névrotiques dans la <b>jalousie,</b> la paranoïa et l'homosexualité" [...] ("On some neurotic mechanisms in jealousy, paranoia and homosexuality"). It was published in the Revue française de psychanalyse. In Autumn of that same year, Lacan began his training analysis with Rudolph Lowenstein, which was to last until 1938.|$|E

60|$|The suburbs are, if possible, {{even more}} unsubstantial-looking than the city.

Turning, at length, {{into one of the}} numerous streets which branched from this main thoroughfare, they stopped before a rather mean-looking house with <b>jalousie</b> blinds to every window; a flight of steps before the green street-door; a shining white ornament on the rails on either side like a petrified pineapple, polished; a little oblong plate of the same material over the knocker whereon the name of 'Pawkins' was engraved; and four accidental pigs looking down the area.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a {{louvered}} window, the <b>jalousie</b> window consists of parallel slats of glass or acrylic that open and close like a Venetian blind, usually using a crank or a lever.

5000|$|La <b>Jalousie</b> (Jealousy) is a 1957 {{novel by}} Alain Robbe-Grillet.

The jealous husband in the novel spies on his wife through the Venetian blind-like slats of the <b>jalousie</b> windows of their home.|$|E
