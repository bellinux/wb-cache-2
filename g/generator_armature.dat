40|$|Abstract — Methodology {{and results}} are {{presented}} for numerical simulations and field experiments using point absorption ocean wave energy harvesting buoy systems, using the heave motion of the buoys to produce useful electrical power. Two approaches, a direct-drive system and a resonantdrive system are analyzed. These systems are not designed for large scale grid power applications, but rather for relatively low-power ocean sensor and communications applications, with power requirements in the 1 - 10 W range. The field experiments provided useful data for model verification and validation purposes. Results showed that RMS values for armature displacement and armature velocity and mean harvested electrical power were generally within 10 % between model simulations and experimental data. Index Terms – energy conversion, wave energy harvesting, linear generator, ocean energy, heaving buoy I. NOMENCLATURE A rigid-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which forces the linear <b>generator</b> <b>armature</b> to perfectly track (or mirror) the ocean wave surface elevation without amplification or attenuation of amplitude. A direct-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which attempts to force the linear <b>generator</b> <b>armature</b> to track (or mirror) the ocean wave surface elevation, but is {{unable to do so}} perfectly, resulting in attenuation of the amplitude. A resonant-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which allows the linear <b>generator</b> <b>armature</b> and/or the buoy to resonate with, and amplify, the ocean wave surface elevation.

The DC voltage to the <b>generators</b> <b>armature</b> would be varied manually or electronically to control the output voltage. When used in this fashion, the MG set is equivalent to an isolated variable transformer.|$|R

This has the advantages of strength, simplicity, symmetrical appearance, and minimum magnetic leakage, since the pole pieces have the least possible surface and {{the path of the}} magnetic flux is shorter than in a two-pole design.|$|R

40|$|Battery {{charging}} {{wind turbines}} like, Hybrid Field Generator, {{have become more}} popular in the growing renewable energy market. With wind energy, voltage and current control is generally provided by means of power electronics. The paper describes the analytical investigation in to control aspects of a hybrid field generator controller for optimized performance. The project objective is about maintaining the generated voltage at 28 V through out a generator speed range, between 149 rpm and 598 rpm. The over voltage load, known as dump load, {{is connected to the}} control circuit to reduce stress on the bypass transistor for speeds above 598 rpm. Maintaining a stable voltage through out the speed range, between 149 rpm and 598 rpm, is achieved by employing power electronics techniques. This is done by using power converters and inverters to vary the <b>generator</b> <b>armature</b> excitation levels hence varying its air gap flux density. All these take place during each of the three modes of generator operation, which are: buck, boost and permanent magnet modes. Although the generator controller is power electronics based, it also uses software to optimize its performance. In this case, a PIC 16 F 877 microcontroller development system has been used to test the controller function blocks...|$|E
40|$|For grid integration, a low-frequency (i. e. 50 or 60 Hz) {{transformer}} {{is placed}} inside the nacelle of the {{offshore wind turbine}} to step-up the voltage to the grid voltage levels of 11 – 33 kV. The heave weight and large size of the step-up transformer significantly increase the weight and volume of the turbine. These penalties are critical in offshore applications, where cost of installation and regular maintenance are extremely high. As an alternative approach to achieve a compact and lightweight offshore and onshore wind turbine a medium voltage converter is proposed. The converter modules are cascaded to achieve medium voltage output. Each converter module is fed {{by a pair of}} generator coils with 90 phase shift to get the stable dc-link power. The power factor correction (PFC) circuit enables the generator to achieve unity power factor operation and the <b>generator</b> <b>armature</b> inductance is used as ac-side PFC boost inductance. At the grid-side, H-bridge inverters are connected in series to generate multilevel medium voltage output and the voltage-oriented vector control scheme is adopted to regulate the converter active and reactive power transferred to the grid. This new technology will enable transformer-less compact and lightweight turbine design, and has a great potential to be implemented in the future offshore wind farms and smart grid applications. The simulation is done by MATLAB/SIMULINK software...|$|E
50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and <b>generator</b> <b>armatures,</b> field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel, single point-of-attachment, gravitational torque energy harvesting system powered from rotational motion. The primary aim {{of such a}} system is to scavenge energy from a continuously rotating host in order to power a wireless sensor node. In this thesis, a wireless tachometer was prototyped. Most published work on motion-driven energy harvesters has used ambient vibrations in the environment as the energy source. However, none of the reported devices {{have been designed to}} harvest energy directly from continuous ambient rotation. There are important applications such as tire pressure sensing and condition monitoring of machinery where the host structure experiences continuous rotation. In this work, it is shown that in many applications, a rotational energy harvester can offer significant improvements in power density over its vibration-driven counterparts. A prototype single point-of-attachment rotational energy harvester was conceived using a simple direct-current generator. The rotational source was coupled to the stator and an offset mass was anchored on the rotor to create a counteractive gravitational torque. This produces a relative angular speed between rotor and stator which causes power to be generated. Power transfer from the generator to a load was maximised by enforcing an input impedance match between the <b>generator’s</b> <b>armature</b> resistance and the input impedance of a boost converter which in this case, functioned as a resistance emulator. Energy storage and output voltage regulation were implemented using supercapacitors and a wide-input buck regulator respectively. When excess power was generated, it was stored in the supercapacitors and during low source rotation speeds, i. e. insufficient harvested power, the supercapacitors will discharge to maintain operation of the interface electronics. A detailed optimisation procedure of a boost converter was conducted in Matlab in order to minimise the power loss, resulting in a maximum voltage gain of 11. 1 and measured circuit efficiency of 96 %. A state-space control model of the harvester electronics was developed in the analogue domain using classical control techniques and this showed the system to be closed-loop stable. A final prototype of the rotational energy harvesting system was built and this comprised an input impedance controller, wireless transmitter and tachometer. The entire system has a measured end-to-end efficiency which peaked at 58 % from a source rotation of 1400 RPM with the generator producing 1. 45 W under matched load conditions.

50|$|In the armature, an {{electromotive}} force {{is created by}} the relative motion of the armature and the field. When the machine acts in the motor mode, this EMF opposes the armature current, and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power {{in the form of}} torque (unless the machine is stalled), and transfers it to the load via the shaft. When the machine acts in the <b>generator</b> mode, the <b>armature</b> EMF drives the armature current, and shaft mechanical power is converted to electrical power and transferred to the load. In an induction generator, these distinctions are blurred, since the generated power is drawn from the stator, which would normally be considered the field.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} {{revolving}} <b>armature</b> <b>generators</b> {{is to have}} the armature part on a rotor and the magnetic field part on stator. A basic design, called elementary generator, is to have a rectangular loop armature to cut the lines of force between the north and south poles. By cutting lines of force through rotation, it produces electric current. The current is sent out of the generator unit through two sets of slip rings and brushes, one of which is used for each end of the armature. In this two-pole design, as the armature rotates one revolution, it generates one cycle of single phase alternating current (AC). To generate an AC output, the armature is rotated at a constant speed having the number of rotations per second to match the desired frequency (in hertz) of the AC output.|$|R
40|$|A {{synchronous}} machine is an AC machine whose speed {{under steady-state conditions}} {{is proportional to the}} frequency of the current in its armature. Polyphase DC excited {{synchronous machine}}s comprise a polyphase armature winding and a DC field winding. At synchronous speed, the rotating magnetic field created by the armature currents travels at the same speed as the field created by the field current, and a steady torque results. The purpose of this section is to develop a quantitative theory from which both the electrical and mechanical characteristics of synchronous motors and generators can be determined. The synchronous machine is idealized {{to the extent that the}} effects of salient poles and magnetic saturation are not included. Synchronous machines can be classified as cylindrical-rotor or salient-pole machines. The cylindrical-rotor construction is used in high-speed steam-turbine-driven <b>generators.</b> The <b>armature</b> windings consist of laminated conductors placed in the stator slots. They are usually 3 -phase Y-connected windings, and voltages of above 13800 volts, line to line, are common in sizes above several thousand kilowatts. The rotor carries the DC field winding. Most of the turbine generators being built at present for 60 -cps service are 2 -pole 3600 -rpm machines. Because of the economies of high-speed high-temperature high-pressure steam turbines, much study and some real pioneering work have been devoted to improvements in materials and design of both generators and turbines, and the maximum ratings for which 3600 -rpm machines have been built have approximately doubled before the decade. 1 The filed windings are embedded in axial slots cut in the rotor and are held in place by metal wedges. They usually consist of concentric coils of insulated copper strap laid flat in the slots. The rotor coil ends and ends connections are firmly held in place by retaining rings shrunk on over the ends of the coils. The leads are connected to slip rings which make contact with carbon brushes through which the field current is introduced. 2 The mmf wave created by such a winding is shown by the step wave. The height of each step in the wave is proportional to the total current in the slot below it...|$|R
