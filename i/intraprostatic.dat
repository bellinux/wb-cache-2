50|$|Epristeride {{is unique}} in its {{mechanism}} of action relative to finasteride and dutasteride in that it binds irreversibly to 5α-reductase and results {{in the formation of}} an unproductive complex of the 5α-reductase enzyme, the substrate testosterone, and the cofactor NADPH. For this reason, testosterone is caught in a trap, and it was initially speculated that the reciprocal increase in <b>intraprostatic</b> levels of testosterone seen with finasteride and dutasteride should not happen with epristeride. However, subsequent clinical data have not supported this hypothesis. Moreover, {{in spite of the fact}} that epristeride is a very potent inhibitor of 5α-reductase type II (0.18-2 nM), it has been found to reduce circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by only 25 to 54% following 8 days of therapy over a dosage range of 0.4 to 160 mg/day. For this reason, relative to other 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, the degree of DHT suppression with epristeride falls short of that desirable for full clinical benefit.|$|E
50|$|Transurethral {{microwave}} thermotherapy (TUMT) {{was originally}} {{approved by the}} United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, with the first generation system by EDAP Technomed. Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund. Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT. The general principle underlying all the devices is that a microwave antenna that resides in a urethral catheter {{is placed in the}} <b>intraprostatic</b> area of the urethra. The catheter is connected to a control box outside of the patient's body and is energized to emit microwave radiation into the prostate to heat the tissue and cause necrosis. It is a one-time treatment that takes approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the system used. It takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the damaged tissue to be reabsorbed into the patient's body. Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{measurement}} of the male external urethral sphincter complex (EUSC) length by magnetic resonance imaging and urethral pressure profilometry did not consider the <b>intraprostatic</b> portion, although its role for urinary continence has been demonstrated. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility of a morphological evaluation of the EUSC by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Materials and Methods: Data from 52 men that underwent TRUS were prospectively collected. The EUSC was identified in the midline sagittal plane. Total and <b>intraprostatic</b> EUSC length and prostate volume were measured. Results: EUSC appears as a hypoechoic area surrounding the urethra. The proximal end was identified between the verumontanum and the prostate apex by the net change in prostate echo patterns, while the distal end was identified by voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter. Mean total and <b>intraprostatic</b> EUSC lengths were 20. 17 and 3. 78 mm, respectively. Total EUSC length presented a weak correlation with prostate volume (r = 0. 41; p = 0. 003), while the <b>intraprostatic</b> portion had a stronger correlation (r = 0. 60; p = 0. 001). Conclusions: The evaluation of the EUSC is feasible by TRUS, and length measurement should include the <b>intraprostatic</b> portion.

We evaluated baseline <b>intraprostatic</b> vasculature, as {{a predictor}} of efficacy of TUMT. METHODS: Twenty-two patients, with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction, were treated with TUMT (Prostatron). At baseline, three-dimensional contrast-enhanced power-flow-Doppler prostate ultrasonography (3 D-CE-PFD) was performed. Assuming that the percentage of perfused area (PPA) is a realistic measure of blood flow, it was used to quantify <b>intraprostatic</b> vasculature. RESULTS: The median (range) age, prostate size, and energy delivered were 66 years (48 - 80), 47 cm(3) (30 - 121), 110 kJ (29 - 136), respectively. The response was 77 % (5 failures). The median (range) PPA was 2. 76 % (0. 7 - 11. 3). No difference in PPA among good and poor responders was detected nor was any correlation between PPA and baseline parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline <b>intraprostatic</b> vascularization, documented by CE-PFD studies, has no predictive value for the efficacy of TUMT.

40|$|Androgen {{deprivation}} therapy (ADT) and 5 -α-reductase (5 AR) inhibition {{are used}} in the treatment of men with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), respectively. These drugs exert their effect by lowering androgen levels in the serum and allegedly, the prostate gland. It is, however, unknown whether (increased) <b>intraprostatic</b> androgen levels are associated with the pathogenesis of BPH and with the initiation and progression of prostate cancer.

We developed biodegradable, doxorubicin-loaded cylinders for <b>intraprostatic</b> implantation and evaluated the feasibility of using regional <b>intraprostatic</b> drug therapy to treat prostate-confined cancer. Cylinders were prepared using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) or PLG copolymers. The in vitro and in vivo drug release, <b>intraprostatic</b> pharmacokinetics, and histopathology in dogs implanted with the cylinders were studied. The doxorubicin-loaded cylinders made of PLG polymers of 7. 9 to 54 kDa molecular weight (MW) had a diameter of ∼ 800 μm, drug loading of 10 % to 30 % (wt/wt), and even distribution of crystalline drug throughout the matrix. Burst release varied from 3 % to 73 %, and 7 -day cumulative release from 4 % to 90 %. Decreasing polymer MW and increasing drug loading were associated with higher initial burst release and overall release rates. The in vivo drug release from cylinders (33 -kDa PLG, 30 % drug loading) in dog prostates was rapid (∼ 80 % in 48 hours). Spatial drug distribution, visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy, showed high concentrations confined to the lobule containing the implant (referred to as the implanted lobule), with steep concentration gradients over the septa separating the lobules. Concentrations in the implanted lobule were about 8 times higher than concentrations delivered by an intravenous injection. The implants caused necrotic cell death in the implanted lobule, without damage to prostatic nerve bundles or the urethra.

40|$|Abstract Background Botulinum Toxin Type-A (BoNT/A) <b>intraprostatic</b> {{injection}} can induce prostatic involution {{and improve}} LUTS and urinary flow {{in patients with}} Benign Prostatic Enlargement (BPE). However, the duration of these effects is unknown. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} duration of prostate volume reduction after one single <b>intraprostatic</b> injection of 200 U of Botulinum Toxin Type-A. Methods This is an extension of a 6 month study in which 21 frail elderly patients with refractory urinary retention and unfit for surgery were submitted to <b>intraprostatic</b> injection of BoNT/A- 200 U, by ultrasound guided transrectal approach. In spite of frail conditions, eleven patients could be followed during 18 months. Prostate volume, total serum PSA, maximal flow rate (Qmax), residual volume (PVR) and IPSS-QoL scores were determined at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-treatment. Results Mean prostate volume at baseline, 82 ± 16 ml progressively decreased from month one coming to 49 ± 9, 5 ml (p = 0, 003) at month six. From this moment on, prostate volume slowly recovered, becoming identical to baseline at 18 months (73 ± 16 ml, p = 0. 03). Albeit non significant, serum PSA showed a 25 % decrease from baseline to month 6. The 11 patients resumed spontaneous voiding at month one. Mean Qmax was 11, 3 ± 1, 7 ml/sec and remained unchanged during the follow-up period. PVR ranged from 55 ± 17 to 82 ± 20 ml and IPSS score from 10 to 12 points.

However, in between those intermittent “rigid” registrations, deformable registration was often required.

40|$|Purpose: Initially {{conceived}} as an intervention for prostatic infection, injection therapy {{has been used}} to alleviate urinary retention, and is now primarily investigated for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). For over a century, <b>intraprostatic</b> injection {{has been used as a}} minimally invasive surgical therapy (MIST), and is on the verge of a rebirth. This review will familiarize the reader with the origins and history of <b>intraprostatic</b> injection, and its evolution using transperineal, transrectal and transurethral routes with multiple injectants. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE review of the literature on <b>intraprostatic</b> injections published between 1966 and 2007 was performed, augmented with articles and documents dating back to 1832. Results: Transperineal and transurethral injections have the most systematic evaluation in patients. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each route. Most injectants consistently produce localized coagulative necrosis and gland volume reduction with varying degrees of LUTS relief. Anhydrous ethanol (AE) is the most extensively studied injected agent to date.

40|$|Although {{dihydrotestosterone}} (DHT) is {{the principal}} androgen in the prostate, testosterone can also act as an androgen in this tissue. To determine the relative potencies of testosterone and DHT in preventing prostate regression, castrated rats were implanted for 4 d with varying doses of testosterone in {{the presence or absence}} of the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride. In the absence of finasteride, testosterone in the prostate is converted to DHT, creating an <b>intraprostatic</b> DHT dose response. In the presence of finasteride, this conversion is blocked, and an <b>intraprostatic</b> testosterone dose response is achieved. DHT was 2. 4 times more potent than testosterone at maintaining normal prostate weight and duct lumen mass, a measure of epithelial cell function. The two androgens were equipotent at preventing DNA fragementation and expression of testosterone-repressed prostate message, two measures of apoptosis (cell death). The <b>intraprostatic</b> testosterone concentration that results from finasteride treatment in rats is sufficient to inhibit apoptosis but will not maintain normal epithelial cell activity.

40|$|Context: The <b>intraprostatic</b> {{injection}} of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) is a minimally invasive but still-experimental treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic enlargment (BPE) {{based on an}} off-label use of the drug. Objective: Report the mechanisms of action of BoNT-A on the prostate {{as well as the}} efficacy and safety of <b>intraprostatic</b> BoNT-A injection according to various injection protocols. Evidence acquisition: We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) database and the abstract volumes of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 European Association of Urology (EAU), American Urological Association (AUA) and International Continence Society (ICS) meetings for studies on <b>intraprostatic</b> BoNT-A injection. Evidence synthesis: Five experimental studies and 10 clinical studies were found. The level of evidence is 1 b for one study and 3 for the other studies, with grades of recommendation of A and C, respectively. The experimental studies report induced relaxation of the prostate, atrophy, and reduction of its size through inhibition of the trophic effect of the autonomic system on the prostate gland. In the clinical studies, all patients had LUTS due to BPE and prostate volume varied from 80 ml. The dose varied from 100 U to 300 U of Botox (R). The injection was performed transperineally, transrectally, or transurethrally under general, local, or without anesthesia. The follow-up period ranged from 3 mo to 19. 8 mo. All studies reported an improvement of maximum urinary flow rate, quality-of-life index and reduction of International Prostate Symptoms Score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, post-void residual volume, and prostate volume. Local or systemic side effects were rare. Only patients with retention needed a urethral drainage catheter. Conclusions: BoNT-A <b>intraprostatic</b> injection provides improvement in patients with LUTS due to BPE refractory to medical treatment.

In this review the authors describe the different techniques and clinical studies of bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral resection in saline (TURis), the different laser therapies for the prostate, transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), hot water induced thermotherapy (WIT), prostatic stents, <b>intraprostatic</b> ethanol injections and botulinum toxin A injections. The different bipolar systems and photoselective vaporisation might replace the ''gold standard'', monopolar TURP, in the near future.

OBJECTIVE: • To evaluate patient-reported and objective outcomes after <b>intraprostatic</b> injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: • A prospective single-armed cohort study was designed. • Patients diagnosed with LUTS due to BPH and unsatisfactory response to medical therapy, were recruited between November 2010 and July 2011. • Patients received transperineal injection of 200 U BTX-A in the transition zone, under transrectal ultrasonographic guidance. • The outcome assessment was performed at 3 months and included a patient-reported outcomes (PROs) questionnaire with questions on patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I, 0 - 6 point scale), of satisfaction (PGI-S, 0 - 5 point scale), and of efficacy (PGI-E, 0 - 5 point scale). RESULTS: • Of 75 screened patients, 64 with a mean (sd) age of 63 (9. 3) years were available for the outcome assessment. • Patients reported a mean reduction of 49...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{demonstrate}} the theoretical feasibility of integrating two functional prostate {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) techniques (dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [DCE-MRI] and 1 H-spectroscopic MRI [MRSI]) into inverse treatment planning for definition and potential irradiation of a dominant <b>intraprostatic</b> lesion (DIL) as a biologic target volume for high-dose <b>intraprostatic</b> boosting with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 5 patients, four gold markers were implanted. An endorectal balloon was inserted for both CT and MRI. A DIL volume was defined by DCE-MRI and MRSI using different prostate cancer-specific physiologic (DCE-MRI) and metabolic (MRSI) parameters. CT-MRI registration was performed automatically by matching three-dimensional gold marker surface models with the iterative closest point method. DIL-IMRT plans, consisting of whole prostate irradiation to 70 Gy and a DIL boost to 90 Gy, and standard IMRT plans, in which the whole prostate was irradiated to 78 Gy were generated. The tumor control probability and rectal wall normal tissue complication probability were calculated and compared between the two IMRT approaches. RESULTS: Combined DCE-MRI and MRSI yielded a clearly defined single DIL volume (range, 1. 1 - 6. 5 cm 3) in all patients. In this small, selected patient population, no differences in tumor control probability were found. A decrease in the rectal wall normal tissue complication probability was observed {{in favor of the}} DIL-IMRT plan versus the plan with IMRT to 78 Gy. CONCLUSION: Combined DCE-MRI and MRSI functional image-guided high-dose <b>intraprostatic</b> DIL-IMRT planned as a boost to 90 Gy is theoretically feasible. The preliminary results have indicated that DIL-IMRT may improve the therapeutic ratio by decreasing the normal tissue complication probability with an unchanged tumor control probability. A larger patient population, with more variations in the number, size, and localization of the DIL, and a feasible mechanism for treatment implementation has to be studied to extend these preliminary tumor control and toxicity estimates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) in men are {{a common}} {{clinical}} problem in urology and have been historically strictly linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which may lead to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). New molecules have been approved and have entered the urologists' armamentarium, targeting new signaling pathways and tackling specific aspects of LUTS. Objective of this review is to summarize the evidence regarding the new medical therapies currently available for male non-neurogenic LUTS, including superselective α 1 -antagonists, PDE- 5 inhibitors, anticholinergic drugs and <b>intraprostatic</b> onabotulinum toxin injections. Methods: The National Library of Medicine Database was searched for relevant articles published between January 2006 and December 2015, including the combination of "BPH", "LUTS", "medical" and "new". Each article's title, abstract and text were reviewed for their appropriateness and their relevance. One hundred forty eight articles were reviewed. Results: Of the 148 articles reviewed, 92 were excluded. Silodosin may be considered a valid alternative to non-selective α 1 -antagonists, especially in the older patients where blood pressure alterations may determine major clinical problems and ejaculatory alterations may be not truly bothersome. Tadalafil 5 mg causes a significant decrease of IPSS score with an amelioration of patients' QoL, although with no significant increase in Qmax. Antimuscarinic drugs are effective on storage symptoms but should be used with caution in patients with elevated post-void residual. <b>Intraprostatic</b> injections of botulinum toxin are well-tolerated and effective, with a low rate of adverse events; however profound ameliorations were seen also in the sham arms of RCTs evaluating <b>intraprostatic</b> injections. Conclusion: New drugs have been approved {{in the last years}} in the medical treatment of BPH-related LUTS. Practicing urologists should be familair with their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

40|$|Aim. This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} role of [C- 11] choline positron emission tomography (PET) for the <b>intraprostatic</b> tumor characterization and localization in recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT. Methods. This retrospective {{study was conducted in}} patients who were being followed up after EBRT for histological proven prostate cancer. We selected the patients with a local recurrence by [C- 11]choline PET/CT fusion. The results of PET were compared with the results of histology and with clinical follow-up. Results. Forty-two patients with a local recurrence suggested by PET were included in this study. According to PET results: of the 42 patients, 15 (36 %) had a focal recurrence, 27 (64 %) showed a diffuse recurrence. The overall concordance of PET with histology concerning detection of recurrence was 76 % (32 patients had positive PET results and positive biopsies). We confirmed the local recurrence as visualized by PET in 37 / 42 (88 %) patients using a composite reference with histology and clinical follow up after local salvage treatment. The concordance of the <b>intraprostatic</b> distribution of the tumor with PET with histology from transrectal prostate biopsies (median biopsies 7, range 4 - 12) was 47 % (7 / 15) in unilateral cases and 41 % (11 / 27) in bilateral cases. No significant differences were seen between the 2 groups in serum PSA at time of PET (P= 0. 509) and SUV (P= 0. 739) using Student's t-test. Conclusion. <b>Intraprostatic</b> characterization of recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT with C- 11 -choline PET is feasible at present but shows a moderate concordance with routine transrectal prostate biopsies. The accuracy is too low for the routine use of this modality in the present scenario...|$|E
