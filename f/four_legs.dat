40|$|The {{main feature}} of a three phase inverter, with an {{additional}} neutral leg, {{is its ability to}} deal with load unbalance in a standalone power supply system [7],[12]. The goal of the three phase <b>four</b> <b>leg</b> inverter is to maintain the desired sinusoidal output voltage waveform over all loading conditions and transients. It is ideal for applications like data communication, industrial automation, military equipment, which require high performance uninterruptible power supply. As shown in Figure 1. 2, the three phase <b>four</b> <b>leg</b> inverter is used in the shipboard DC DPS to provide secondary AC power distribution.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>four</b> <b>leg</b> shunt {{active power}} filter has strong ability of {{harmonic}} and neutral current compensation, and is especially suitable for three-phase four-wire system harmonic suppression. At present the single inductor filter is usually used in <b>four</b> <b>leg</b> shunt active power filter, but the single inductor filter {{does not have}} enough capacity for high frequency harmonic attenuation. Due to this，this paper proposes a three-phase four-leg applied to active power filter LCL filter. This paper proposes a LCL filter which is applied to three-phase four-leg active power filter. However, LCL filter can produce resonance. Series resistance in capacitor branch can inhibit resonance. As a result, it will consume more active power. So this paper proposed control strategy using capacitive current feedback, which can not only effectively suppress resonance but also avoid consuming active power.

The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have <b>four</b> <b>legs,</b> but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on <b>four</b> <b>legs),</b> and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all <b>four</b> <b>legs</b> and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E

5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least <b>four</b> <b>legs</b> on the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} trees on <b>four</b> <b>legs</b> (quadrupedal locomotion).

The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The thorax of the {{butterfly}} {{is devoted to}} locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on <b>four</b> <b>legs).</b> The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all <b>four</b> <b>legs</b> is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or <b>four</b> <b>legs.</b> Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E
5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having <b>four</b> <b>legs,</b> laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E

5|$|The {{classical}} folklorist Adrienne Mayor {{has proposed}} that the griffin of mythology is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the Gobi Desert. She noted that griffins were said to inhabit the Scythian steppes that reached from the modern Ukraine to central Asia. Mayor draws a connection to Protoceratops, a frilled dinosaur that was commonly found in the Gobi. This dinosaur has features associated with griffins: they share sharp beaks, <b>four</b> <b>legs,</b> claws, similar size, and large eyes (or eye sockets {{in the case of}} the fossils), and the neck frill of Protoceratops, with large open holes, is consistent with descriptions of large ears or wings. However, the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron.|$|E
5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former {{are the basic}} troops of the Gorn forces, and while they can run on <b>four</b> <b>legs,</b> they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E
