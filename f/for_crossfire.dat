50|$|Violence can {{induce a}} hot zone, as {{occupants}} {{are subject to}} attacks, crossfire, or even direct fire targeted at them specifically. The most identifiable violent hot zones are in war zones, such as the war in Afghanistan. Soldiers are constantly fighting with other soldiers and insurgents to attempt to accomplish tactical goals. Hot zones are not good places to appear {{as a member of}} either of the opposing teams, because one may be prone to attacks or capture. Although war zones may have the most targeted attacks, crime ridden neighborhoods are the most common areas <b>for</b> <b>crossfire</b> to occur, and subsequently the most victims of crossfire are here.|$|E
50|$|With {{the release}} of the Radeon X1950 Pro (RV570 GPU), ATI has {{completely}} revised CrossFire's connection infrastructure to further eliminate the need for past Y-dongle/Master card and slave card configurations <b>for</b> <b>CrossFire</b> to operate. ATI's CrossFire connector is now a ribbon-like connector attached to the top of each graphics adapter, similar to nVidia's SLI bridges, but different in physical and logical natures. As such, Master Cards no longer exist, and are not required for maximum performance. Two dongles can be used per card; these were put to full use with {{the release of}} CrossFireX. Radeon HD 2900 and HD 3000 series cards use the same ribbon connectors, but the HD 3800 series of cards only require one ribbon connector, to facilitate CrossFireX. Unlike older series of Radeon cards, different HD 3800 series cards can be combined in CrossFire, each with separate clock control.|$|E

50|$|A masked Cruz was {{introduced}} to the angle as {{a new version of the}} Súper Fénix, with González losing their first two encounters and dropping the Universal Championship. A third match for the title concluded in a double disqualification. González then wrestled a recent addition to Colón's stable, a now-heel Huertas, to a disqualification. Cruz retained the Universal Championship at Camino a la Gloria 2013. After briefly interrupting the feud with a match against Colón, Gonzalez won the title in a stipulation match where his career was on the line, holding it for a pair of weeks before losing it to Cruz's associate, Chris Angel. A rematch concluded with a disqualification. During this timeframe, an angle took place where Cruz defied being Súper Fénix, leading to a career vs. mask match at Summer Madness. The event took place on June 29, 2013, Cruz defeated González, who entered into another hiatus in his career following a faux retirement ceremony. The following month, the character of El Fénix made a return joining Rivera, who had been expelled from the heel faction, to feud with Huertas and Cruz. At Aniversario both versions of the Fénix faced each other, with Cruz losing the contest and his mask. Later in the event, a still masked González intervened and costed Colón a match against Sting. After unsuccessfully challenging Angel for the Universal Championship, he resumed his previous feud. A mask vs hair match was announced <b>for</b> <b>Crossfire</b> in which Colón defeated Rey Fénix, but it was revealed that Ricky Santana had supplanted González for this event.On that same night, the storyline involving the faux retirement was concluded by granting him permission to resume his career. Despite winning, Colón protested the switch and intervened in a contest between him and Angel. At Lockout, a masked heel wrestler known as Mighty Ursus attacked González after losing a match, beginning a parallel feud. The following night, he resumed his previous storyline by defeating Colón. Another match between them concluded with the same result to open Euphoria 2014. The following night González joined Santana in a loss to Colón and Huertas, the latter of whom betrayed his partner. Days later Rivera, who had adopted a martial arts gimmick that he used two decades earlier known as TNT, also turned to recreate a faction known as Los Inhumanos.|$|E
