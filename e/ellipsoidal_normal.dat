40|$|It {{may soon}} become {{possible}} to routinely stake an absolute {{location of a}} geodetic coordinate repeatedly {{on the ground to}} millimeter accuracy using GPS. A cadastre could be developed using such coordinates as the definitive location of boundary corners. A boundary line would be a one-dimensional line connecting boundary corners. A boundary line extending into space or {{toward the center of the}} Earth would be a two-dimensional surface with length, height and no width. A cadastre using geodetic coordinates would most naturally use the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> to define the vertical dimension, however historically (and in many jurisdictions, legally) the vertical dimension has been defined by the plumb line. Unlike the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal,</b> the plumb line is not a straight line but is rather a space curve with finite radius of curvature and torsion (Leick 1995). The deflection of the vertical is the angular difference at the Earth’s surface between the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> and the tangent to the plumb line. (For instance, a 2 second deflection of the vertical results in about 5 cm difference in a vertical distance of 3 km underground and 2 km above ground, distances over which an owner might reasonably be expected to have actual control).

40|$|Accurate {{analysis}} of over voltage in the superconducting solenoid during a quench {{is one of}} the bases for quench protection system design. Classical quench simulation methods can only give rough estimation of the over voltage within a magnet coil. In this paper, for multi-sectioned superconducting solenoid, based on the classical assumption of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> zone, three-dimension al temperature results are mapped to the one-dimension of the wire, the temperature distribution along the wire and the resistances of each turn are obtained. The coil is treated as circuit comprised of turn resistances, turn self and mutual inductances. The turn resistive voltage, turn inductive voltage, and turn resultant voltage along the wire are calculated. As a result, maximum internal voltages, the layer-to-layer voltages and the turn-to-turn voltages are better estimated. Utilizing this method, the over voltage of a small solenoid and a large solenoid during quenching have been studied. The result shows that this method can well improve the over voltage estimate, especially when the coil is larger...|$|E
40|$|Geoid {{determination}} is {{the process}} of calculation of the length of the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> (geoid undulation) between the geoid surface and the reference ellipsoid. Various methods are used in determination of the geoid undulations. The solution, that considers a global geopotential model (GM), gravity anomalies (Δg), and topographic effects, is used to determine the gravimetric geoid undulation. The remove-restore technique is a combination of the spherical harmonic and Stoke’s formulation. The long wavelength effects from a geopotential model and short wavelength effects from the topography are mathematically removed from the observed gravity anomalies in this technique. The Stoke’s formulation of the residual parts of the gravity anomalies yields the medium wavelength of the geoid height. The geoidal height of a point is determined by restoring the long and short wavelength components. If the area for determining local geoid is chosen small and is considered as planar, it can be divided into M by N grids while distances Δx and Δy are the grid intervals. The geoid undulations can be calculated from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) solutions of the Kernel functions of the gridded gravity anomalies and distances...|$|E

Yeast profilin resembles profilins from other organisms in molecular mass and in the ability to bind to polyproline, retard the rate of actin polymerization, and inhibit hydrolysis of ATP by monomeric actin. Using strains that carry disruptions or deletions of the profilin gene, we have found that, under appropriate conditions, cells can survive without detectable profilin. Such cells grow slowly, are temperature sensitive, lose the <b>normal</b> <b>ellipsoidal</b> shape of yeast cells, often become multinucleate, and generally grow much larger than wild-type cells. In addition, these cells exhibit delocalized deposition of cell wall chitin and have dramatically altered actin distributions...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that alopecia areata (Aa) may preferentially affect pigmented hair and may spare white hair, and that regrowing {{hair in the}} disease is often initially white. In addition, there is an association with vitiligo and ocular depigmentation. To date, the pathomechanisms of the melanocyte effects are unclear. We have studied 10 patients with untreated acute alopecia areata, and three normal patients without hair loss. Morphologic changes, studied by conventional light and electron microscopy, in the cytoplasm of affected melanocytes often predated nuclear hyperchromatism. Increased numbers of bizarre melanosomes were found in affected melanocytes compared with normal ones; such melanosomes had incomplete or “aborted” melanization, resulting in poor pigment deposition, and were disrupted, enlarged and rounded, with loss of <b>normal</b> <b>ellipsoidal</b> shape. An unusual outer root sheath (ORS) distribution of hair bulb melanocytes was seen. Other atypical melanosome effects included marked pigment displacement into peribulbar and DP melanophages. In the DP clumped melanin granules formed giant spherical complexes without discernible limiting membranes, which were sometimes associated with lymphocytes. These morphologic changes indicate an active involvement of hair bulb melanocytes in alopecia areata...|$|R
40|$|The melanin macroglobule (MMG), {{formerly}} called “macromelanosome,” is a cytoplasmic spherical granule {{formed in}} the melanocyte, varying in size from one to several microns, much larger than <b>normal</b> <b>ellipsoidal</b> melanosomes. Although ultrastructural features of MMG have been adequately described in the past, {{there has been a}} disagreement about the formation process of MMG. In order to further elucidate the nature and origin of MMG, electron microscopic studies were conducted in several pigmentary disorders. Our findings included: (1) The most remarkable characteristics of MMG are (a) the pleomorphism of their internal structure and (b) the variation of their size. (2) MMG do not represent true melanosomes but unique forms of autolysosomes resulting from the fusion of autophagosomes (containing various numbers of melanosomes) with primary and/or secondary lysosomes. (3) MMG are retained within melanocytes or transferred to keratinocytes and to Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and to macrophages in the dermis in any of their developmental stages. After transfer, MMG can fuse with other heterolysosomes and probably increase in size in these cells. We regard melanosome complexes as but one step in an autophagic process within melanocytes which can, on occasion, produce MMG as residual bodies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} few years, new {{developments}} in the field of geodetic astronomy have been sparsely published. This might be {{due to the fact that}} the determination of deflections of the vertical still required relatively large efforts, both in time and in manpower, thus keeping the costs per point at a high level. Recently, the development of new high performance image sensors (CCD) at a reasonable price level enabled and initiated fundamental improvements in astrogeodetic observation instrumentations in terms of efficiency, automation, accuracy, and real-time capability. This promising development leads to a revitalization of astrogeodetic methods and offers very encouraging prospects for local high-precision astrogeodetic gravity field and geoid determinations. In this paper, two slightly different versions of the digital zenith camera, initially developed at the Institut für Erdmessung, University of Hannover, are presented as high-precision state-of-the-art instruments. Using modern CCD technology for imaging stars and a GPS receiver, these systems allow the direct determination of the direction of the plumb line and thus its deflection from the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> within a fully automated procedure in real-time.

40|$|As a first {{approximation}} the Earth is a sphere; as {{a second}} approximation it may be considered an ellipsoid of revolution. The deviations of the actual Earth's gravity field from the ellipsoidal 'normal' field are so small {{that they can be}} understood to be linear. The splitting of the Earth's gravity field into a 'normal' and a remaining small 'disturbing' field considerably simplifies the problem of its determination. Under the assumption of an ellipsoidal Earth model high observational accuracy is achievable only if the deviation (deflection of the vertical) of the physical plumb line, to which measurements refer, from the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>normal</b> is not ignored. Hence, the determination of the disturbing potential from known deflections of the vertical is a central problem of physical geodesy. In this paper we propose a new, well-promising method for modelling the disturbing potential locally from the deflections of the vertical. Essential tools are integral formulae on the sphere based on Green's function of the Beltrami operator. The determination of the disturbing potential from deflections of the vertical is formulated as a multiscale procedure involving scale-dependent regularized versions of the surface gradient of the Green function. The modelling process is based on a multiscale framework by use of locally supported surface curl-free vector wavelets...|$|E

40|$|Subcellular defects of hypomelanosis in {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TS) (28 subjects) were compared by light and electron microscopy with {{other forms of}} congenital circumscribed hypomelanosis that occur in nevus depigmentosus (ND) (8 subjects) and in piebaldism (PB) (4 subjects), respectively. On the light microscopic level in both TS and ND, the population density of functioning melanocytes was normal but each perikaryon was small, and dopa activity was decreased. On the ultrastructural level, the hypomelanotic skin and hair of TS were associated with {{a decrease in the}} synthesis, melanization, and size of melanosomes; the decrease in the size of melanosomes resulted in the aggregation of melanosomes (i. e., a melanosome complex) in the keratinocytes in all the specimens examined. In ND, there were no obvious changes in the size and melanization of melanosomes. There was, however, an aggregation of melanosomes within the melanocytes. The hypomelanosis of ND is related to the decreased synthesis and also, perhaps, abnormal transfer of melanosomes. In PB, the hypomelanosis of the skin and hair results from the absence of functional melanocytes. The hypermelanotic areas of PB, however, characteristically contain melanocytes that synthesize abnormal (spherical and granular) as well as <b>normal</b> (<b>ellipsoidal</b> and lamellar) melanosomes...|$|R

Unreduced (2 n) gametes are an interesting tool for polyploidisation and the creation of genetic variation in plant breeding. Especially in ornamentals, polyploidisation can broaden attractive features within a species. A Begonia collection was screened on the occurrence of 2 n pollen with the aid of four different techniques: pollen size measurement, flow cytometric analysis of nuclei isolated from germinated and non germinated pollen, investigation of the microsporogenesis and analysis of progeny. In ten of the 70 screened genotypes (B. dregei, B. pearcei, B. 'Anna Christina', B. 'Bubbles', B. 'Florence Rita', B. 'Orococo', B. 'Rubaiyat', B. 'Spatflacier', B.

40|$|A new boundary-integral {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to study the}} deformation of drops between two parallel walls. The free-space Green's functions are extended to obey the no-slip condition at the walls. The current formulation is limited to drops with viscosity equal to the matrix fluid, but can be extended to study the effect of non-unit viscosity ratio systems. With this method {{the influence of the}} capillary number and the degree of confinement on drop deformation is investigated. Results for small capillary are compared with small-deformation theory and large capillary results with recent experiments. In both cases an excellent match is observed. Drops undergoing shear flow deform stronger and align themselves more in the flow direction as the distance between the walls becomes smaller relatively to the drop size. Furthermore, the shapes of the drops start to divert significantly from the <b>normal</b> <b>ellipsoidal</b> shapes found, as they show more pointed tips closer to the walls. The transient deformation behavior for more confined systems shows that the drops stretch out to a maximum value, and the slowly retract again to a steady situation. For larger capillary numbers even damped, oscillatory behavior is observed. Investigating the critical capillary number reveals that a minimum is found at a mediocre degree of confinement, after which the critical capillary number increases again to values even larger than the unconfined system. The breakup mode also makes a significant change as it goes from binary to ternary breakup, where the breakup occurs as the drop is retracting...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{possible}} importance of regional non-uniformity of left ventricular function, angiograms of 42 normal subjects and 105 patients with coronary artery disease were digitised frame by frame. Regional curvature around the cavity was assessed, only positive curvature being compatible with <b>ellipsoidal</b> geometry. In <b>normal</b> subjects, positive curvature of the anterior wall was shown by all, but on the inferior wall was present in only 12 (28 %) at end-diastole and five (12 %) at end-systole. In patients with ischaemic heart disease, anterior wall curvature was again positive in all but four with apical aneurysm, but positive curvature of the inferior wall was present more frequently than normal, 47 (42 %) at end-diastole and 39 (36 %) at end-systole. In these patients, positive curvature at end-diastole was associated with reduced wall movement during ejection. Though the pattern of coronary artery involvement was random, there were conspicuous regional differences {{in the distribution of}} abnormal wall movement during isovolumic relaxation. Outward movement was found only on the anterior wall. Abnormal inward movement was five times as frequent on the inferior wall as on the anterior. An ellipsoidal cavity outline is not therefore characteristic of the normal left ventricle and, when present, this configuration is likely to be associated with a reduced amplitude of inferior wall movement. Regional differences of both structure and function can thus be shown in normal and abnormal hearts. They may arise from variation in local fibre architecture. Their presence {{must be taken into account}} in interpreting abnormalities of left ventricular function...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} for local gravity field modelling from gravity data using spherical radial basis functions. The methodology comprises two steps: in step 1, gravity data (gravity anomalies and/or gravity disturbances) {{are used to}} estimate the disturbing potential using least-squares techniques. The latter is represented as a linear combination of spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs). A data-adaptive strategy is used to select the optimal number, location, and depths of the SRBFs using generalized cross validation. Variance component estimation is {{used to determine the}} optimal regularization parameter and to properly weight the different data sets. In the second step, the gravimetric height anomalies are combined with observed differences between global positioning system (GPS) <b>ellipsoidal</b> heights and <b>normal</b> heights. The data combination is written as the solution of a Cauchy boundary-value problem for the Laplace equation. This allows removal of the non-uniqueness of the problem of local gravity field modelling from terrestrial gravity data. At the same time, existing systematic distortions in the gravimetric and geometric height anomalies are also absorbed into the combination. The approach is used to compute a height reference surface for the Netherlands. The solution is compared with NLGEO 2004, the official Dutch height reference surface, which has been computed using the same data but a Stokes-based approach with kernel modification and a geometric six-parameter “corrector surface” to fit the gravimetric solution to the GPS-levelling points. A direct comparison of both height reference surfaces shows an RMS difference of 0. 6 cm; the maximum difference is 2. 1 cm. A test at independent GPS-levelling control points, confirms that our solution is in no way inferior to NLGEO 2004.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an integrated approach for the computation of Height Reference Surfaces (HRS) {{in the context of}} GNSS positioning. For this purpose, the method of Digital Finite Element Height Reference Surface software (DFHRS) is extended, allowing the use of physical observations in addition to geometrical observation types. Particular emphasis is put on (i) using Adjusted Spherical Cap Harmonics to locally model the potential, (ii) developing a parameterization of coefficients for a least squares estimation, and (iii) optimizing the combination of data needed to calculate the coefficients. In particular, the selection of the terrestrial gravity measurements, height fitting points with known <b>ellipsoidal</b> and <b>normal</b> heights, {{and the use of the}} available global gravity models as additional observations are investigated. One of the main motivations is the need to compute a high precise local potential model with the ability to derive all components related to the potential W. These observation components are gravity, quasigeoid height, the geoid height, deflections of the vertical in the east and north direction (), the fitting points and the apriori information in terms of coefficients of a local potential model derived from the developed methods of a mapping of a global one. This thesis provides a method for local and global gravity and geoid modelling. The Spherical Cap Harmonics (SCH) for modeling the Earth potential are introduced in detail, including their relationship to the normal Spherical Harmonics (SH). The different types of Spherical Cap Harmonics, such as Adjusted Spherical Cap Harmonics (ASCH), Translated-Origin Spherical Cap Harmonics (TOSCH) and the Revised Spherical Cap Harmonics (RSCH) are discussed. The ASCH method was chosen in further for modeling the local gravitational potential due to its simple principle, that the integer degree and order Legendre functions are preserved and lead to faster implementation algorithms. The ASCH are used in this thesis to transform the global gravity models like EGM 2008 or EIGEN 05 c to local gravity models, guaranteeing a much smaller number of coefficients and making the calculations faster and easier. Tests are applied to validate the use of ASCH for local gravity and potential modelling, with ASCH coefficients calculated in test areas. These coefficients were used to calculate the values of potential or the gravity for new points and then compared with the real measured values and reference values from global models. The tests include the transformation of global gravity models like EGM 2008 and EIGEN 05 c to ASCH models and the integrated solution of heterogeneous groups of data including terrestrial gravity data, height fitting points and the locally mapped global gravity models. The region of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany was used as a test area for this thesis to prove the concept. Nearly 15000 terrestrially measured gravity observations were used to implement an ASCH model in degree and order of 300 in order to achieve a resolution of 0. 01 mGal that corresponds to the measurement accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} for {{the combination of}} a gravimetric (quasi-) geoid with GNSS-levelling data in the presence of noise with correlations and/or spatially varying noise variances. It comprises two steps: first, a gravimetric (quasi-) geoid is computed using the available gravity data, which, in a second step, is improved using ellipsoidal heights at benchmarks provided by GNSS once they have become available. The methodology is an alternative to the integrated processing of all available data using least-squares techniques or least-squares collocation. Unlike the corrector-surface approach, the pursued approach guarantees that the corrections applied to the gravimetric (quasi-) geoid are consistent with the gravity anomaly data set. The methodology is applied to a data set comprising 109 gravimetric quasi-geoid heights, <b>ellipsoidal</b> heights and <b>normal</b> heights at benchmarks in Switzerland. Each data set is complemented by a full noise covariance matrix. We show that when neglecting noise correlations and/or spatially varying noise variances, errors up to 10 % of the differences between geometric and gravimetric quasi-geoid heights are introduced. This suggests that if high-quality ellipsoidal heights at benchmarks are available and are used to compute an improved (quasi-) geoid, noise covariance matrices referring to the same datum should be used in the data processing whenever they are available. We compare the methodology with the corrector-surface approach using various corrector surface models. We show that the commonly used corrector surfaces fail to model the more complicated spatial patterns of differences between geometric and gravimetric quasi-geoid heights present in the data set. More flexible parametric models such as radial basis function approximations or minimum-curvature harmonic splines perform better. We also compare the proposed method with generalized least-squares collocation, which comprises a deterministic trend model, a random signal component and a random correlated noise component. Trend model parameters and signal covariance function parameters are estimated iteratively from the data using non-linear least-squares techniques. We show that the performance of generalized least-squares collocation is better than the performance of corrector surfaces, but the differences with respect to the proposed method are still significant.
