25|$|To {{support his}} {{position}} that methodological rules {{generally do not}} contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend provides counterexamples to the claim that (<b>good)</b> <b>science</b> operates according to a certain fixed method. He took some examples of episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the Copernican revolution), and showed that all common prescriptive rules of science are violated in such circumstances. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution.|$|E

The apparent reason is that subjectivism is supported by the opponent process theory that is a successful neurophysiological reduction of colors.

500|$|Final Blackout and Fear {{are often}} cited by critics {{as the best}} {{examples}} of Hubbard's pulp fiction works. Chuck Moss of Daily News of Los Angeles called the book [...] "extremely <b>good</b> <b>science</b> fiction". The book has been included in the curriculum of a science-fiction writing class at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Cal Poly Pomona professor Steve Whaley told The Press-Enterprise that he thinks Hubbard was a [...] "damn good storyteller". Karl Edward Wagner cited Final Blackout as one of the thirteen best science-fiction horror novels.|$|E
500|$|A broad issue {{affecting}} the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, {{what part of}} the world and man is studied by science. Philip Kitcher in his [...] "Science, Truth, and Democracy" [...] argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for <b>good</b> <b>science</b> by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{amount of}} technical advice for the production came from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), who provided Trek fan Jesco von Puttkamer as advisor to the film. Roddenberry had known Puttkamer since 1975, when they had been introduced by a mutual friend, the Assistant Director of Astronautics at the Smithsonian Institution. From 1976 until {{the completion of the}} film Puttkamer provided the writers, producer, and director with memos on everything technical in the script; the scientist reviewed every line in the script, and was unpaid for his assistance. [...] "Science fiction films, including those of the recent past, have been woefully short of <b>good</b> <b>science</b> advice," [...] he said. [...] "Star Wars [...] really not science fiction. I loved it, but it's a fairy tale of princes and knights in another galaxy. The technology was improbable, the science impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film three stars out of four, {{describing}} the revelation {{at the end}} a [...] "fundamental flaw" [...] and a [...] "cheat." [...] He wrote, [...] "The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two." [...] R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, [...] "I love a <b>good</b> <b>science</b> fiction story; just tell me in advance." [...] He gave the film a B-. Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was [...] "'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When Hornig {{took over}} from Lasser {{at the end}} of 1933 he {{attempted}} to continue and expand Lasser's approach. Hornig introduced a [...] "New Policy" [...] in the January 1934 issue, emphasizing originality and barring stories that merely reworked well-worn ideas. He asked for stories that included <b>good</b> <b>science,</b> although [...] "not enough to become boring to those readers who are not primarily interested in the technicalities of the science". However, Astounding was moving into the lead position in the science fiction magazine field at this time, and Hornig had difficulty in competing. His rates of payment were lower than Astoundings one cent per word; sometimes his writers were paid very late, or not at all. Despite these handicaps, Hornig managed to find some good material, including Stanley G. Weinbaum's [...] "A Martian Odyssey", which appeared in the July 1934 Wonder and has been frequently reprinted.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both <b>good</b> <b>science</b> and good philosophy.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} Dr. Strangelove (1964), director Stanley Kubrick became {{fascinated by}} the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and resolved to make [...] "the proverbial <b>good</b> <b>science</b> fiction movie". Searching for a collaborator in the science fiction community, Kubrick was advised by a mutual acquaintance, Columbia Pictures staffer Roger Caras, to talk to writer Arthur C. Clarke. Although convinced that Clarke was [...] "a recluse, a nut who lives in a tree", Kubrick allowed Caras to cable the film proposal to Clarke, who lived in Ceylon. Clarke's cabled response stated that he was [...] "frightfully interested in working with enfant terrible", and added [...] "what makes Kubrick think I'm a recluse?" [...] Meeting {{for the first time at}} Trader Vic's in New York on April 22, 1964, the two began discussing the project that would take up the next four years of their lives. Clarke kept a diary throughout his involvement with 2001, excerpts of which were published in 1972 as The Lost Worlds of 2001.|$|E
500|$|Alpha Centauri set out {{to capture}} the whole sweep of humanity's future, {{including}} technology, futuristic warfare, social and economic development, {{the future of the}} human condition, spirituality, and philosophy. Reynolds also said that [...] "getting philosophy into the game" [...] was one of the attractions of the game. Believing <b>good</b> <b>science</b> fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies. As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy. Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external [...] "natural forces" [...] intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences. Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action. Another concern was that Planet matched the story, which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents, as {{it is supposed to be}} a gigantic neural network.|$|E
500|$|The writing {{style was}} {{positively}} received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post remarked the writing was [...] "always lucid, sometimes elegant". In The New York Times Book Review Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a [...] "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity {{giving way to}} the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire". Janet Maslin of The New York Times found the writing had [...] "an arid, plain, what-if style" [...] while being [...] "strangely uniform in tone". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that [...] " [...] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is {{the heart and soul}} of this book" [...] and that it is [...] "written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet". The Plain Dealer book editor Karen Long said Weisman [...] "uses the precise, unhurried language of a <b>good</b> <b>science</b> writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts".|$|E

40|$|<b>Good</b> <b>sciences</b> have <b>good</b> metaphors. Indeed, <b>good</b> <b>sciences</b> are <b>good</b> {{because they}} have good metaphors. AI could use more good metaphors. In this editorial, I would like to propose a new metaphor to help us {{understand}} intelligence. Of course, whether the metaphor is any good or not depends on whether it actually does help us. (What I am going to propose is not something opposed to computationalism [...] the hypothesis that cognition is computation. Noncomputational metaphors are in vogue these days, and to date they have all been equally plausible and equally successful. And, just to be explicit, I do not mean “IQ ” by “intelligence. ” I am using “intelligence” in the way AI uses it: as a semi-techical term referring to a general property of all intelligent systems, animal (including humans), or machine, alike.) What is it that we prize most highly about intelligence? What is the essence o f intelligence? It is this: the ability to go beyond the information given (I refer the reader to Jerome Bruner’s classic paper “Going beyond the information given, ” (Bruner, 1957)). I think this captures our intuition that somehow intelligence is the ability to see beyond what’s there. The further one can see, the more intelligent one is. Let me explain a bit further by paraphrasing F. C. Bartlett...|$|R

500|$|The {{managing}} editor, Sam Moskowitz, {{also had}} a long history in the field, having helped organize the First World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. [...] He too had strong views about what constituted <b>good</b> <b>science</b> fiction, though his views did not always coincide with those of his publisher: Gernsback's focus was on the educational potential of sf, while Moskowitz was a fan of the early writers in the field, from before the Golden Age. [...] Moskowitz was the one in charge of obtaining stories, and he succeeded in acquiring work by many of the best-known names in sf, including Clifford Simak, Murray Leinster, Robert Bloch, James H. Schmitz, and Philip José Farmer, but he also bought many stories by writers from {{the early years of the}} genre, such as Raymond Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates. [...] The result was a magazine that both Ashley and fellow sf historian Donald Lawler describe as old-fashioned, despite its smart appearance: in Ashley's words, Science-Fiction Plus had [...] "a feeling of archaism", and he adds [...] "for a magazine to be 'slick', it didn't just have to look slick, it had to feel it, but in the case of Science-Fiction Plus all that glittered clearly was not gold". [...] Lawler agrees, describing the magazine as [...] "an anachronism", and [...] "dull from first to last". [...] As part of Gernsback's attempt to encourage stories that contained plausible scientific predictions, he created a symbol made up of a sphere labeled [...] "SF", with a five-pointed star atop it. [...] He placed the first of these awards on a story of his own, [...] "Exploration of Mars", in the first issue, in what Lawler describes as [...] "a characteristic self-tribute".|$|E

The SF Site's Steven H Silver, conversely, felt that the alternating viewpoint was not executed as well as it could have been, and that Ivan [...] "makes a better support character than a primary character"; Silver conceded, however, that Ivan and Tej may [...] "seem less than dynamic merely in comparison to Bujold's more typical protagonists".|$|E
2500|$|In A Darwinian Left, Singer {{outlines}} a {{plan for}} the political left to adapt to the lessons of evolutionary biology. He says that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is [...] "right." [...] He concludes that game theory (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially, Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for cooperation that also has been selected for during human evolution. Singer's writing in Greater Good magazine, published by the Greater <b>Good</b> <b>Science</b> Center of the University of California, Berkeley, includes the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.|$|E
