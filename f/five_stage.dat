5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} doping {{case from}} the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi took <b>five</b> <b>stage</b> wins, but after the third of them, he tested non-negative for salbutamol, an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, {{and it had a}} concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol, above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. Salbutamol has anabolic effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.|$|E

2500|$|Replacement water {{should be}} of the same source as the aquarium, whether it be reverse osmosis (RO), {{de-ionized}} (DI), distilled or from a municipal supply, {{in order to avoid}} drastic changes in water chemistry. In cases where one is replacing a tap water-based salt mix with a reverse osmosis-based salt mix, the replacement water should be added slowly {{over the course of several}} hours to avoid sending the aquarium inhabitants into osmotic shock. [...] However, large water changes are not advised under routine circumstances anyway, so this is really irrelevant. Municipal, or tap water, is not recommended for a marine aquarium as it often contains high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates and other dissolved solids which fuel the growth of nuisance algaes, particularly diatoms, which appears as a rust colored powdery algae and grows in the overabundance of silicates present in all tap water. [...] Water filtered by a four-stage process including mechanical, carbon, reverse-osmosis, and de-ionizing components is recommended as this can provide the easiest route to absolutely pure water. [...] Four and <b>Five</b> <b>stage</b> RO/DI filtration units can be obtained for as little as $100 and are a cost effective means of converting tap water into water usable in a marine aquarium.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the first}} stage of the Tour of California, Sagan had a {{puncture}} with 7 kilometres to go. He worked {{his way back to the}} bunch and avoided a crash that occurred with 3 kilometres left in the race. His teammate Daniel Oss piloted him in the last few kilometres, and Sagan out sprinted his rivals, taking the stage win. The very next day, he won again on stage 2, in Santa Cruz. After suffering a crash in the Empire Grade climb, he got back on and his team dragged him to the last corner of the race, a right bend with the finish line only a couple hundred metres away. Sagan was first out of the corner and accelerated to the finish, taking his second victory in a row. On the third stage, Sagan took his third consecutive victory by a very slim margin over Heinrich Haussler (...) for the third time in a row. He would go on to win again on the fourth stage in a bunch finish. After the dust settled on the Tour, Sagan had <b>five</b> <b>stage</b> wins, including the eighth and final stage in Los Angeles and the points jersey, shattering the previous record of Tour of California stage wins with a cumulative of eight stages, the previous mark attained by Levi Leipheimer of the [...] squad with six.
