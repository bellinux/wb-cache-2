40|$|In {{grid-connected}} inverters, a feedforward controller accurately {{compensates for}} {{a large number of}} the harmonic components of the injected current. This controller is fast and directly tackles the grid dynamic voltage disturbances without doing any further harmonic analysis. A feedforward controller was introduced to a three-phase grid connection with a wye configuration; however, for the widespread <b>delta</b> <b>connections,</b> such a scheme is less established. Moreover, the nonsinusoidal profile of the grid voltage waveform makes the online conversion of line-to-line values into phase values impossible. In this paper, implicit zero-sequence discontinuous pulse width modulation (IZDPWM) based feedforward control is implemented on the two-level grid-connected inverter. Regardless of the grid topology, the IZDPWM-based controller ensures sinusoidal current injection to the grid under balanced, unbalanced, and distorted conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operating}} capabilities of STATCOMs based on Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converters (MMCC) using star and <b>delta</b> <b>connections,</b> with {{special attention to}} unbalanced load compensation. Zero sequence voltage for star connection, and zero sequence current for delta, need {{to be applied to}} overcome the phase cluster DC-voltage unbalance. Expressions are derived for both zero sequence elements as functions of the degree of load unbalance defined as the ratio of negative to positive sequence load current. They show that the zero sequence voltage in star connection reaches a very high level as the degree of load unbalance increases, making the MMCC DC-link voltage too high for correct functioning. However the delta connected MMCC can cope with the high level of load current unbalance. Experimental results are presented to validate this analysis...|$|R

5000|$|In power systems, Harmonics are {{multiples}} of {{the fundamental}} wavelength. Thus, the third order harmonic is the third multiple {{of the fundamental}} wavelength. This type of harmonics is generated in non-linear loads. Examples of nonlinear loads include transistors, electrical motors, and the non-ideal transformer. Nonlinear loads create disturbances in the fundamental harmonic, which produce all types of harmonics. However, in this section {{we focus on the}} 3rd order harmonic due to its certain special characteristics in the context of powers systems.Power is supplied by a three phase system, where each phase is 120 degrees apart. This is done for two reasons: Firstly it is because generators/motors that use three phases are more efficient due to the constant torque the phases supply, and secondly it is because after power is supplied to a load, the three phases can theoretically be added onto a neutral wire and cancel each other out. This saves the utility from creating return wiring to the power plant. However, if the 3 phases contain 3rd order harmonics, the currents will not fully add to zero. As seen in the figure, the 3rd harmonic will add constructively with the 3rd harmonics within the other phases. This leads to an oscillating current in the neutral wire, which can be dangerous since it is designed (i.e. small-size conductors) to carry minimal current. To avoid 3rd harmonics adding together <b>Delta</b> <b>connections</b> are used, and the current is cycled around the connection instead of combining into the neutral of a Wye connection.|$|R
