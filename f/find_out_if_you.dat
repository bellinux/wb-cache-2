We don't have something to say, hey, yes - because we don't know where that airplane is and we need to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> take one theory, the airplane would be where we're looking at right now. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> take another theory, where there was nefarious intent, they're trying to avoid radars, the airplane could be somewhere else. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> say it was - whatever it is, you've got to use these theories, weigh them against the facts so you know which one to go to.|$|R
50|$|The tenth digit is a {{checksum}} {{which was}} introduced in 1967 when the system was computerized. Originally, when the personal identity number was introduced, it had nine digits and the seventh and eighth denoted the county (Swedish: län) in which the subject was born or {{had been living in}} 1947 - see above. The seventh digit was 9 for foreign born. This system was replaced with the current system in 1990. Everyone however keeps their number and {{it is not hard to}} <b>find</b> <b>out</b> someone's number <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know the birth date, the birth county and the checksum algorithm. Even easier is to call the tax authority and ask, since the personal identity number is public information.|$|R
