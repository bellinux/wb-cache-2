25|$|Patients {{generally}} {{arrived from}} the Western Front by train to the evacuation station in Creil (12km away). There was no possibility of transferring patients to other nearby hospitals and patient load was occasionally extreme. During the Battle of the Somme, the surgeons and doctors worked for eight days {{with a total of}} only 16 hours of sleep. Conditions at the facility were occasionally insufficient and the hospital failed an initial <b>inspection</b> before <b>opening</b> on January 13, 1915. Electricity was at times intermittent and in case of an outage surgeries were performed by candlelight.|$|R

5000|$|Elimination {{also applies}} to processes. For example, the risk of falls can be {{eliminated}} by eliminating the process of working in a high area, by using extending tools from the ground instead of climbing, or moving a piece {{to be worked on}} to ground level. [...] The need for workers to enter a hazardous area such as a grain elevator can be eliminated by installing equipment that performs the task automatically. [...] Eliminating an <b>inspection</b> that requires <b>opening</b> a package containing a hazardous material reduces the inhalation hazard to the inspector.|$|R
40|$|Main {{target of}} this paper is to improve {{monitoring}} performance of rotating equipments with the help of sensor networks. We focus on high accurate methods of vibration and displacement measurements needed for diagnostics of engineering structures like Pipelines/injection pumps, Pipeline/injection compressors, Turbines, Heaters, Boilers, Dams, and Bridges etc. How monitoring nodes and sink node work under monitoring software by taking inputs from vibration methods. Also discuss about how we transplanting Tiny Operating System in monitoring nodes and sink nodes. These monitoring nodes gather / retrieve multimedia information such as video and audio, images, scalar data from surroundings. Telnet and Web server are used as a remote control tools. Instead of <b>inspection</b> and <b>opening</b> up equipment Class societies will increasingly accept, trending of vibration, performance monitoring and evidence of other non intrusive condition monitoring methods as the basis for inspection and survey. The laser light divided into two parts one directly goes to object and second goes to acousto-optic modulator. We simply represent working with the help of diagram shown below...|$|R
50|$|Contract {{had been}} let to Brotherhood for the {{construction}} of the Shepton Mallet section early in 1857 and in October 1858 Captain Yolland of the Board of Trade visited the line for the formal <b>inspection</b> prior to <b>opening</b> for passengers. There were a number of detail issues: a turntable was provided at Shepton Mallet but not at Witham; and the signalling arrangements at Witham were questionable. The Company undertook that only tank engines would be used, rendering the turntable unnecessary, and Brunel personally managed to persuade the Board of Trade that opening was permissible: they agreed, and the opening took place on 9 November 1858.|$|R
40|$|A multi-functional high-precision {{comprehensive}} {{diagnostic system}} for laser parameters was developed. The entire diagnostic system {{was composed of}} a fundamental frequency laser diagnostic module, a tripled frequency laser diagnostic module, an online optic damage <b>inspection</b> module, an <b>opening</b> frequency conversion unit and corresponding auxiliary units. Under {{the control of the}} system software, it can automatically perform accurate measurement, data collection, storage and processing on laser parameters such as near-field, far-field, energy, wavefront and pulse-waveform before and after the laser frequency conversion.

50|$|In 1975, Tanaami {{became the}} first art {{director}} of the Japanese edition of Playboy Magazine, “Monthly Playboy”, and went to New York once again to visit Playboy’s head office. The editor there took him to Andy Warhol’s Factory. Tanaami’s works from this period, mostly in the mediums of film and print, were provocative and experimental. His films in particular received wide critical acclaim, appearing in the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in Germany (1975, 1976), the New York Film Festival (1976), and the Ottawa International Animation Festival in Canada (1976). The vanguard nature of his work led the police to shut down his 1976 exhibit “Super Orange of Love” at Nishimura Gallery for <b>inspection</b> on the <b>opening</b> day.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the schools}} within the {{federation}} were formerly run by local authorities, and forced by central government to become academies {{as part of the}} Harris Federation against the wishes of the parents and boards of governors. There was national media coverage over Downhills Primary School (now Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane), where it was reported that 94% of parents opposed the change to academy status. At the time, the government said it had decided to close Downhills Primary School and re-open it as a Harris Academy because of 'chronic underperformance' at Downhills. According to national news reports, standards of education at Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane quickly improved with the Federation’s involvement. Having been in special measures before becoming a Harris academy, its first <b>inspection</b> report after <b>opening</b> found that it was now good with outstanding features.|$|R
50|$|In November 1904 the {{purchase}} of four additional trams was authorised, along with the provision of slipper brakes on the eighteen existing trams and new trolley standards for eight trams. On 20 December a special meeting of the council approved the extension to River. The tender of the British Electrical Equipment Company for construction of the double track line {{at a cost of}} £10,353 was accepted. Dick, Kerr & Co’s tender for four new trams at a cost of £575 each was also accepted. It was commented in the Dover Express that more covered cars should be provided but the cover fitted to No.14 was not successful as it was too heavy. It was eventually removed and converted to an office at the Maxton depot. The new trams were delivered on 19 May 1905 and the new line at Crabble Hill was under construction by June. By September the line was complete enough for a Board of Trade <b>inspection.</b> The official <b>opening</b> of the extension was on 2 October.|$|R

Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest <b>inspection,</b> and on <b>opening</b> it, a door will immediately appear--which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automated visual {{inspection}} {{is defined as}} a quality control task that determines automatically if a product, or test object, deviates from a given set of specifications using visual data. In the last 25 years, many research directions in this field have been exploited, some very different principles have been adopted and a wide variety of algorithms have been appeared in the literature. However, automated {{visual inspection}} systems still suffer from i) detection accuracy, because there is a fundamental trade off between false alarms and miss detections; and ii) strong bottleneck derived from mechanical speed and from high computational cost. For this reasons, automated visual inspection remains an open question. In this sense, Automated Multiple View Inspection, a robust method that uses redundant views of the test object to perform the <b>inspection</b> task, is <b>opening</b> up new possibilities in inspection field by taking into account the useful information about the correspondence between the different views. This strategy is very robust because in first step it identifies potential defects in each view and in second step it finds correspondences between potential defects, and only those that are matched in different views are detected as real defects. In this paper, we review the advances done in this field giving an overview of the multiple view methodology and showing experimental results obtained on real data...|$|R
40|$|Kurt Ismail Hakkı Pasha {{was born}} in Kars in 1818. He began his first career as a senator (ayan) in Şüregel {{district}} of Kars Sanjak in 1833. He joined the wars in İran in 1841 and and in Crimea in 1853. He got his reputation at Firka-i Islahiyye, where the place was founded for the tribes to settle down. He cendered his service at the governorship of Diyarbakır between 1868 - 75. Having founded a printing office in Diyarbakır, he began to publish Diyarbekir Gazetesi the offical gazette of the governorship. Also, he had an almanac (Salname) published every year. He opened reformatory (ıslahhane) having seen it as {{an important part in}} the field of education. By means of the reformatory, abandoned children had a chance of having education and career. At the same time, schools for the boys and grammer schools were opened the rate of educated people in Diyarbakır were increased. İsmail Hakkı Pasha gave a great importance to the severage system works in Diyarbakır and the worn out roads having a connection with the other province were repaired and the new roads were opened under his <b>inspection.</b> With the <b>opening</b> of the new water canals, more products were obtained in the agricultural areas. His most success in Diyarbakır was to reorganize and settle the moving tribes. Because those tribes were disclaiming the authority of the state. For the safety of Diyarbakır, Ismail Hakkı Pasha had to take some precautors for those tribes. After completing his dutf as a governor in Diyarbakır, he went to Erzurum in 1876. He joined the Ottoman-Russian war between 1877 - 78. After the war, he was summored to Istanbul and there, he had important duties. Ismail Hakkı Pasha died in Üsküdar, Istanbul on 22 February 1897...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} to place sealants {{is a difficult}} one, {{and it has been}} suggested that in a low risk population it may be efficient to wait until caries is detected in the fissure. An invasive sealant technique with fissure preparation may then be indicated. The diagnostic method used in the indication of such a procedure should accurately detect both dentine caries and sound fissures: high sensitivity for dentine caries (at D 3 threshold) with high specificity for enamel caries (at D 1 threshold), The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic performance of selected diagnostic methods at normal cut-offs for traditional dentine caries detection and at reduced cut-offs in relation to the desired performance mentioned above, and to assess whether fissure opening allows for accurate visual detection of dentinal caries, Data were obtained from 230 occlusal sites of 101 extracted human molar teeth, Diagnostic methods used on the entire sample were: visual inspection, electrical conductance measurements and laser fluorescence measurements. The sample was then divided into two groups, Group 1 was subjected to visual inspection after application of a dye. Group 2 was subjected to visual <b>inspection</b> after fissure <b>opening</b> only, and after subsequent dye application. Validation was performed by histological investigation. The results with cut-offs normally used in dentine caries detection were roughly in accordance with the literature, except for laser fluorescence, The sensitivity of visual inspection for dentinal caries (D 3) was 17 % before and 70 % after fissure opening. Using reduced cut-offs, a 100 % sensitivity (D 3) was achieved with 2 methods, but this also resulted in 63 or 87 % false positive diagnoses of sound surfaces. Visual inspection and electrical methods both showed a moderate to high sensitivity (D 3) with a higher than 50 % specificity (D 1). It was concluded that visual inspection and electrical methods at reduced cutoffs may aid the indication of invasive sealant treatment. The visual detection of dentinal caries is substantially increased, but not perfect after fissure opening. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG. Basel...|$|R
