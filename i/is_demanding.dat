Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken a more moderate, reformist position than they expected of him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza <b>is</b> <b>demanding</b> and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E
5|$|Brian Griffin is {{a strict}} high school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico who never accepts late {{homework}} and <b>is</b> <b>demanding</b> of his students. When Mark Kinney, {{one of the}} students in his class, plagiarizes a paper Mr. Griffin makes him beg to be allowed back into the class. However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, Betsy Cline, and Susan McConnell. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the plan as a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result <b>is</b> <b>demanding</b> to read.|$|E

25|$|The {{linearity}} requirement <b>is</b> <b>demanding,</b> {{especially for}} transmitter RF output circuitry where amplifiers are often {{designed to be}} non-linear in order to minimise power consumption. In practical OFDM systems {{a small amount of}} peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade-off against the above consequences. However, the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce out-of-band spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped, so clipping is not an effective way to reduce PAPR.|$|E

25|$|As the ICRC {{has grown}} {{and become more}} {{directly}} involved in conflicts, it has seen an increase in professional staff rather than volunteers over the years. The ICRC had only twelve employees in 1914 and 1,900 in the Second World War complemented its 1,800 volunteers. The number of paid staff dropped off after both wars, but has increased {{once again in the}} last few decades, averaging 500 field staff in the 1980s and over a thousand in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1970s, the ICRC became more systematic in training to develop a more professional staff. The ICRC is an attractive career for university graduates especially in Switzerland, but the workload as an ICRC employee <b>is</b> <b>demanding.</b> 15% of the staff leaves each year and 75% of employees stay less than three years. The ICRC staff is multi-national and averaged about 50% non-Swiss citizens in 2004. The ICRC's international staff are assisted in their work by some 13,000 national employees hired in the countries where the delegations are based.|$|E
25|$|Annoyed at Sir Eglamour’s success, {{the next}} task that the earl gives his daughter’s suitor {{is to kill}} the Boar of Sidon, a dreadful beast that has laid waste to the area where it lives. Sir Eglamour spends a month {{travelling}} out to Sidon where he locates this boar by seeing all the bodies of dead men strewn about the ground; in a scene that is perhaps mimicked by one featuring a Rabbit of Caerbannog in the irreverent Monty Python movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After a struggle with this boar that lasts for three days, Sir Eglamour kills the ferocious creature. His feat of bravery and skill-at-arms is noticed by the King of Sidon, who is riding nearby {{on the day that}} Sir Eglamour at last overcomes this beast. The king takes Sir Eglamour back to his castle where his daughter (beautiful, of course) is being threatened by a giant. This giant <b>is</b> <b>demanding</b> her hand in marriage and when he appears, Sir Eglamour kills him singlehandedly. The King of Sidon at once offers to confer onto Sir Eglamour all his titles and lands, as well as the hand of his daughter in marriage.|$|E

500|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in seven movements in two parts, {{to be performed}} {{before and after the}} sermon.

The Baroque instrumental ensemble is formed by two oboes, taille, strings and basso continuo. The alto part <b>is</b> <b>demanding</b> and was probably written with a specific singer in mind, as with the two other solo cantatas composed in the same period.|$|E

50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity of demand, {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will <b>be</b> <b>demanded.</b> A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will <b>be</b> <b>demanded.</b> Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good, if a higher quantity <b>is</b> <b>demanded</b> of one good, a higher quantity will also <b>be</b> <b>demanded</b> of the other, and if a lower quantity <b>is</b> <b>demanded</b> of one good, a lower quantity will <b>be</b> <b>demanded</b> of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.|$|R
