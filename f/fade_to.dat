5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds {{around the base of}} the lignotuber. Old flower spikes <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking {{the head of}} the snake, with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E

5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, with collar and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E

50|$|However, {{monochromatic}} {{has also}} another meaning {{near to the}} words “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue <b>fading</b> <b>to</b> black), and the colors created from the one hue but <b>faded</b> <b>to</b> all wavelengths (to white). This design should not be called as monochromatic in strictly scientific meaning.|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, do not recognize this putative synonymy.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.|$|E

Game-Maker games are also distinguished by their eccentric 20x20 tile and sprite size (as opposed to the more standard 8x8 or 16/16 dimensions), populating a standard 100x100 tile (2000x2000 pixel) map size. Transition between scenes is achieved through a slow <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> or from black.|$|E

25|$|Especially {{popular in}} this period were vanitas paintings, in which sumptuous {{arrangements}} of fruit and flowers, books, statuettes, vases, coins, jewelry, paintings, musical and scientific instruments, military insignia, fine silver and crystal, were accompanied by symbolic reminders of life's impermanence. Additionally, a skull, an hourglass or pocket watch, a candle burning down or a book with pages turning, {{would serve as a}} moralizing message on the ephemerality of sensory pleasures. Often some of the fruits and flowers themselves would be shown starting to spoil or <b>fade</b> <b>to</b> emphasize the same point.|$|E
