500|$|It was undeniable that Nelson had enemies. Floridian trappers envied {{his skill}} and viewed {{him as an}} {{outsider}} because he was from New Jersey. The State wanted to develop his land into condominiums and golf courses. Shortly before his death, a man who repaired one of Nelson's jeeps {{found out he was}} sick and had not seen a doctor in six months. The man took him to a doctor who prescribed him painkillers. A neighbor, and the last man to see Nelson alive, speculated: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be possible for someone to sneak up on him. Ordinarily it would be impossible... but if he were doped up, well that would be different." ...|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E
2500|$|For {{her final}} {{question}}, Cooley drew {{the question of}} former Miss USA Shandi Finnessey. [...] She was asked: [...] "What famous person does your personality most parallel?" [...] Her answer was: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be Oprah. She has a passion for life. She loves what she does, and she works so hard to try to achieve everything in her life... I try to emulate myself after that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help to put Nevis {{out of your}} mind. I'd an {{idea you}} wanted cheering up--and I felt a little like that myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A similar 1850 sketch {{showed an}} {{addition}} {{between the two}} wings {{being used as a}} storefront. The author noted the building's dilapidated state and correctly <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be razed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have {{accepted}} Lord Halliburn? I <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be so. I suppose I ought to congratulate you, Dorothy. At any rate, I {{hope you will}} be very happy with him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Larson was {{the first}} to animate the title {{character}} whom he envisioned as a sixteen-year-old with braids and a pug nose. Marc Davis later animated Cinderella, in which Larson observed as [...] "more the exotic dame" [...] with a long swanlike neck. Because the final character design was not set, assistant animators were responsible for minimizing the differences. When Walt was asked what was his favorite piece of animation, he answered, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have to be where Cinderella gets her ballroom gown", which was animated by Davis.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he had, it's {{got to be}} registered. You {{can find}} out at the record office, and I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> pay you to go and see." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{second is}} not {{difficult}} to <b>guess.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have ended in the Divorce Court had not the deserted wife felt that a finer revenge would be secured to her by silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no; on no {{account the}} doctor. 'Tell a doctor, {{tell the whole}} ship. Besides, I've only got a touch of 'em. You'd never have <b>guessed</b> <b>it,</b> <b>would</b> you? The tooth-wash does the trick. I'll give you the prescription.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{ran over}} and Bobby and I put this song {{together}} {{in five minutes}} and rushed it to the theater," [...] Ric reflected one evening to his stepsons, Parris and Dalton. [...] "I never <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> become such a hit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is as I <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be," [...] he answered, {{shaking his}} great head. [...] "You are too honest to prosper in the world, Macumazahn. Well, I must find other means {{to bring the}} House of Cetewayo to the end that he deserves, who has been an evil and a cruel king." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] agreed Carnally. [...] "Still I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be safer}} {{on the other}} side, where we'll strike it sooner coming back. It's wise to take no chances in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And no wonder," [...] {{said the}} first speaker with an oath, [...] "after the tumble you gave him into the boat! I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have broke your neck if you had got it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hastings {{was taken}} off his guard. [...] "Yes," [...] he said decidedly, [...] "if you can put any {{pressure}} on Gregory I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be very desirable {{to do it as}} soon as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} operator mused for a moment. Then {{he asked}} Earl {{who he was}} and where he lived, and finally said he <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be all right. The message was again written out, and ten minutes later it was on its long journey westward, by way of Boston. The business finished, Earl thanked the operator and started on his return home.|$|R
60|$|With a snarl {{the old man}} {{ran around}} {{the foot of the}} bed to corner his prey between the bed and the wall. He was {{swinging}} the ax as though to hurl it. So close was he that Barney <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be difficult for him to miss his mark. The least he could expect would be a frightful wound. To have attempted to escape would have necessitated turning his back to his adversary, inviting instant death. To grapple with a man thus armed appeared an equally hopeless alternative.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be so, Master," [...] {{he replied}} in his gentlest voice, [...] "and for that reason, {{as you will}} notice, I am {{standing}} {{out of reach of}} your sword. You wonder why I am here. I will tell you. It is not from any desire to watch your love-makings which weary me, who have seen such before, but rather that I might find secrets, of which love is always the loser, and those secrets I have learned. How could I have come by them otherwise, Master?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Breakfast, if it wouldn't be {{too much}} trouble. Then, as Farquhar's out, there's {{a piece of paper}} I'd like to give you. <b>Guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be safer out of my hands; the police troopers are after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Calibree adumbrated, [...] "They're a good bunch. Good strong lodge. See {{that fellow}} there that's playing the snare drum? He's the smartest {{wholesale}} grocer in Duluth, they say. <b>Guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be worth joining. Oh say, {{are you doing}} much insurance examining?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{interrupted}} Harry, [...] "of course I {{could never}} mean to frighten her; but I {{did not leave}} off the moment I saw she was afraid, {{because it was so}} very ridiculous, and I did not <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> hurt her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May be 'tis {{the best}} that is like to befall her," [...] said Ridley; [...] "but if that young featherpate only had the wit to <b>guess</b> <b>it,</b> he <b>would</b> find that he might seek Christendom over for a better wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rates [...] "Elaan of Troyius" [...] as a B, making note of {{character}} {{development and the}} unexpected ending: [...] "If you'd asked me to predict {{the rest of the}} episode after Elaan and Kirk hooked up, I would've <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have something to do with}} Kirk interfering with the wedding ... instead, we get a nifty space battle against the Klingons, a traitor in the Elasians, an unexpected source of dilithium crystals, and a curiously muted performance from Shatner that does a good job at conveying his internal struggle between feeling and duty without overselling it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I agreed. A new and indescribable note {{had come}} into Mrs. Scherer's voice, and I {{realized}} that she, too, was aware of that flaw in the redoubtable Mr. Scherer which none of his associates had <b>guessed.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have been strange {{if she had not}} discovered it. [...] "She is beautiful, yes," [...] the lady continued critically, [...] "but she is not to compare with your wife. She has not the heart,--it is so with all your people of society. For them it is not what you are, but what you have done, and what you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the outlaw}} turned to her. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be nice to}} be waited on by a lady, and it might please Charley Leland when he hears of it. I'd like some coffee, and I see the pot here. Bring me the kettle." ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE (with {{a gesture}} {{indicating}} futility). I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{pretty hard to}} get it across to you, Mrs. Pindar. But I was working ten hours a day packing tools in your shops, and all you gave me when the whistle blew was--Jesus.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll remember, mother. I hate {{not to be}} obliging, but I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{have saved}} us lots of trouble if I'd said No in the beginning. I tried to, but she would go. Poor Jill! I'll {{take better care of}} her next time. Is she very ill, Mamma?" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, of course, {{the thing}} was an {{absolute}} fliver, as I ought to have <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be. Whatever could have induced {{me to think that}} a fellow like poor old Dug stood a dog's chance against a determined female like his sister Florence, I can't imagine. It was like expecting a rabbit to put up a show with a python. From the very start there was only one possible end to the thing. To a woman like Florence, who had trained herself as tough as whalebone by years of scrapping with her father and occasional by-battles with aunts, it was as easy as killing rats with a stick.|$|R
6000|$|Upon a {{sleeping}} mother's lips, I <b>guess</b> [...] <b>It</b> <b>would</b> {{have made the}} loving mother dream [...] That she was softly bending down to kiss [...] 15 [...] Her babe, that something more than babe did seem, [...] A floating presence of its darling father, [...] And yet its own dear baby self far rather! ...|$|R
60|$|By noon {{the party}} had covered fifteen miles and were well into the hills. They came to a rest beside a fine spring which flowed from a split in the rocks. Near at hand was some dense brushwood, and old Benson {{rightfully}} <b>guessed</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be difficult to beat up some birds.|$|R
6000|$|Ef I'd my way I hed ruther [...] We {{should go}} to work an' part,-- [...] They take one way, we take t'other,-- [...] <b>Guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> n't break my heart; [...] Men hed ough' to put asunder [...] Them thet God has noways jined; [...] An' I should n't gretly wonder [...] Ef there 's {{thousands}} o' my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "You hain't {{ever been}} in such ladies' society as hers in the same way. I know that they all think the world of you, and flatter you up, and they're as biddable as you please when you're doctorin' 'em; but I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{different}} if you was to set up for {{one of their own}} kind amongst 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{knew more}} about such things," [...] mused Andy. [...] "The last time I tried to read the papers over I couldn't make head or tail of them. I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take a smart lawyer {{to get to the}} bottom of it--and a lawyer would want a lot of money for the work. I wonder----" [...] And then Andy came to a sudden halt.|$|E
6000|$|Peace reigned indeed, but Godwin and Wulf could <b>guess</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not reign for long. Damascus and {{the plain}} around it were one great camp, {{and every day}} new {{thousands}} of wild tribesmen poured in and took up the quarters that had been prepared for them. They asked Masouda, who knew everything, what it meant. She answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. All right." [...] Kennicott was automatic; {{he was the}} official, the physician. [...] "I <b>guess</b> {{probably}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be hard to get}} a nurse here in town just now. Mrs. Stiver is {{busy with}} an obstetrical case, and that town nurse of yours is off on vacation, ain't she? All right, Bjornstam can spell you at night." ...|$|R
60|$|They went out, {{leaving the}} door open. Duane dropped down to rest himself and to wait. He {{would have liked}} to hear Miss Longstreth's answer. But he could <b>guess</b> what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be. Lawson {{appeared}} to be all Duane had thought him, and he believed he was going to find out presently that he was worse.|$|R
