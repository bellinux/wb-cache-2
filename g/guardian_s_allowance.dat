40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology. He taught that humans exist with {{the express purpose of}} accumulating light and truth. This accumulation would continue after death throughout eternity.

Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

Acute diseases are very common among toddlers, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare activity of healthy and acutely ill toddlers. Methods This study was a secondary analysis of the iLiNS-DOSE trial, which took place in Malawi during 2009 - 2012. The ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer was used to measure physical activity. Morbidity measurements were collected into a form by a research assistant together with a <b>guardian</b> <b>s</b> verbal report, based on the already filled Morbidity calendar. Days during which a child was suffering from any symptoms of diarrhoea, fewer or acute respiratory infection were counted as sick days. The main activity outcome was mean vector magnitude accelerometer counts/ 15 s. The secondary outcome was % time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by the vertical axis. We compared the activity of a sick day and a healthy day in within-children and between children. Results Altogether 1 932 participants were enrolled in the iLiNS-DOSE study, 279 children were included in this sub-study and contributed to 843 (41 %) days with symptoms (297 participants of within-children and between-children analyses and 729 participants of all healthy or sick during the measurement week analyses).

40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, much {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of breakfast for people of all ages. Nutritionists have pointed out that persons who eat a hearty breakfast show fewer signs of mid-morning fatigue, have or develop better work habits, and do not get as hungry as those who eat little or no breakfast. Many people do not realize the importance of starting the day with a good breakfast. The 12 to 13 hour fast which the body undergoes from the evening meal until breakfast time requires the consumption of an adequate breakfast. Many poor breakfasts may be attributed to either failure {{to take the time to}} eat, or to not understanding the necessity of an adequate breakfast. Nationwide surveys report that a large number of adolescents and adults fail to receive the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of their caloric and nutrient needs at breakfast. A basic breakfast pattern has been developed to aid in planning an adequate breakfast that will supply 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the calories and other nutrients needed each day. It includes fruit, cereal and/or egg, milk, bread and butter, yet it allows for a wide variation in menus. it is economical and can be easy to prepare. A breakfast of these foods insures one of less morning fatigue and better feeling during the morning and all day long. Studies show that breakfast is the most frequently missed meal. Many of the subjects who did not eat breakfast had a total day 2 ̆ 7 s intake that was classified as poor. Eating two meals a day failed to make up for the deficiency in nutrients. Breakfast consumption shows a direct relationship to the diet score, proof of the fact omitting breakfast is a poor start for the day. At the ages when an individual needs a larger intake of calories and nutrients, many times there is an actual decrease in the intake of nutritions food. The adolescents are noted for this inverse relationship between their nutritive needs and their actual intake. Galloway and Wilcox (1954), in a Utah study of school children, found that the breakfast meal did not furnish the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the day 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories and many of the other nutrients. The noon and evening meals furnished a larger percentage of most nutrients to their diets. The number of children in the study by Galloway, et al., (1954) was somewhat limited.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases).

When including realistic concentrations for species not measured by ATMOS, i. e., the source gases CH 3 CCl 3, and C 2 F 3 Cl 3 below 25 km, and the reservoirs ClO, HOCl and COFCl between 15 and 40 km (five gases actually measured by other techniques), the 30 -degrees-N zonal 1985 mean total mixing ratio of chlorine, Cl, was found to be equal to (2. 58 +/- 0. 10) ppbv (parts per billion by volume) throughout the stratosphere, with no significant decrease near the stratopause. The results for total fluorine indicate a slight, but steady, decrease of its volume mixing ratio with increasing altitude, around a mean stratospheric value of (1. 15 +/- 0. 12) ppbv.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two questions}} of consumers' motor vehicle purchase and utilization. Both {{are related to}} policy variation induced by the U. <b>S.</b> Car <b>Allowance</b> Rebate System, better known as "Cash for Clunkers. " First, we directly investigate the impact of Cash for Clunkers, which was an economic stimulus program aimed at increasing new vehicle spending by subsidizing the replacement of older vehicles. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show the increase in sales during the two month program was completely offset during the following seven to nine months, consistent with previous research. However, we also find the program's fuel efficiency restrictions induced the purchase of more fuel efficient but less expensive vehicles, thereby reducing industry revenues by three billion dollars over the entire nine to eleven month period. This highlights {{the conflict between the}} stimulus and environmental objectives of the policy. Second, we investigate a related topic. Due to the high political costs of raising the tax rate on gasoline, the United States government combats the negative externalities associated with gasoline consumption by regulating the fuel efficiency of new cars sold. However, the success of these Corporate Average Fuel Economy restrictions depends crucially on whether inducing households to drive more fuel efficient cars causes them to drive more miles, which would offset {{some or all of the}} reduction in gasoline consumption. We examine this question by applying a regression discontinuity design to exploit the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency induced among new car buyers in Texas during the Cash for Clunkers program in 2009. While new car buyers whose "clunker" was barely eligible for the subsidy drove a similar number of miles per year prior to the policy and are similar in other ways to barely ineligible new car buyers, they bought significantly more fuel efficient vehicles. However, they did not respond by driving more miles following the program. As a result, the increased fuel economy reduced gasoline consumption proportionally.

The Swedish Government introduced in the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> rules that facilitate retention of profit for sole proprietorships and partnership firms. The tax credits arising from the allowances give certain benefits {{as a source of}} financing compared to traditional forms of credits. Among the more essential benefits are that the payment for some parts of the tax credit can be put on hold almost indefinitely, or alternatively never be paid. The firms are free to use these means, and the responsibility of future payment of the postponed tax debt stays with the individual firms. The comprehensive purpose of the dissertation may be stated as to increase the understanding of small Swedish firms, especially sole proprietorships, utilizing possibilities for allowances for income smoothing and internal financing. At the beginning the dissertation describes case studies, comprising a smaller selection of microfirms. With a starting-point from the accounted and reported income-tax returns, alternative calculations are made where additional positive tax and finance effects appear possible to obtain. One purpose of these studies is to increase the insight regarding the possibilities of income smoothing and internal financing that arise from utilizing these allowances. These studies also illuminate, to what extent and in what way they are being used in reality. Another objective of these studies is to give a more substantive insight into the technics behind the different allowances, appropriation to positive or negative interest rate allocation appropriation or dissolving of tax allocation reserve appropriation or dissolving of “expansion fund” Theories regarding the creation of resources, through building of capital, and theories on financial planning and strategy are studied. The purpose is to find support for the choice of theoretical grounded underlying independent variables {{that can be used in}} cross-sectional studies to explain the use of the possibilities of appropriations. Theories of finance that are of greatest interest, in the operationalisation of these variables, are theories that discuss the choices of different financing alternatives for small firms. The “pecking order theory”, describes the firm’s order of priority when choices of finance alternatives are made. The concept of “financial bootstrapping” expands the frame for different forms of financing choices that especially very small firms have at their disposal. The last part of the theoretical frame deals with the phenomenon of “income smoothing,” which can be translated as leveling out profits/losses. A number of financial and non-financial variables are supported by and operationalised from these financial theories e. g., return on sales, capital turnover, quick ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, respectively age, gender and line of business. Cross-sectional studies are implemented for the taxation years of 1996 and 1999, on databases that have been extracted from Statistics Sweden. The group of 87, 276 sole proprietorships included in the study were required to complete tax returns and pay taxes for the business activity according to the supporting schedule, N 2, information from the sole proprietorships’ income statement and balance sheet in an accounting statement that comes with the income tax return form. The possibilities of allowances are considered as dependent variables. The intention of the cross-sectional studies is to survey and describe the utilization of possible allowances, with the support of the financial and non-financial independent variables. The connection of these variables to the decision of sole proprietorships to appropriate to the tax allocation reserve is also summarized in a logistic regression model. A number of theoretically based propositions are made for the purpose of observing how the variables are connected to the chances that sole proprietorships actually appropriate to this form of allowance. Appropriation to the tax allocation reserve stands out as the most practiced form of allowance. The studies also clarify that utilization varies among different forms of allowances, but that not all firms that have the prerequisites to utilize the possibilities really do so to the full. A further utilization of the different possibilities of allowances is often conceivable. For the sole proprietorships that are not utilizing these possibilities, the allowances should be considered eligible as a contribution to internal financing and to increase access to capital...|$|R

Agrimoniae herba, Betulae folium, Bursae pastoris herba, Foenigraeci semen, Galegae herba, Maydis stigma, Taraxaci radix, Phaseoli fructus sine seminibus, Urticae folium, and their teas were analysed by ICP-OES for element content. Concentration of the elements of crude drug samples obtained are in good agreement with the average concentrations of plants, although some significantly high concentration has been found for manganese (893 mg kg- 1), zinc (275 mg kg- 1) and iron (492 mg kg- 1) in Betulae folium, for copper (41. 2 mg kg- 1) in Galegae herba, for iron (2692 mg kg- 1) in Taraxaci radix, for calcium (41210 mg kg- 1) and magnesium (6275 mg kg- 1) in Urticae folium. The common characteristic feature of crude drugs is the relatively high concentration of chromium (0. 8 - 16. 3 mg kg- 1). Ion concentrations of teas are relatively low. The quantities of metal ions do not cover the daily needs, nevertheless, they may be important as food supplements. According to U. <b>S.</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances</b> (RDA), the following teas are good sources: Agrimoniae herba for chromium, Betulae folium for manganese, Taraxaci radix for copper and chromium, Urticae folium for potassium and calcium.

Com vistas a atingir nosso objetivo investigativo adotamos metodologia de pesquisa em duas etapas: 1) revisão conceitual de três referências teóricas fundamentais - visualização da informação, infografia jornalística e interatividade; e 2) proposta de análise de infovis com base na técnica de pesquisa de análise de conteúdo. Assim, o corpus empírico é constituído por 270 infovis de conteúdo temático político, sobretudo eleitoral, de quatro sítios jornalísticos - The New York Times, The <b>Guardian,</b> Folha de <b>S.</b> Paulo e O Estado de S. Paulo - veiculados entre jan. 2010 e dez. 2013. A partir de sistemático procedimento de análise elaborado segundo unidades e subunidades analíticas orientadas pelas três dimensões teóricas do dispositivo infovis (input, {{interface}} e output), obtivemos respostas codificadas para todas as peças do corpus. A leitura do formulário de análise preenchido gerou resultados e inferências sobre nossa amostra que apontam para aspectos produtivos pioneiros em infografia, como maior abertura comunicacional à audiência, emprego de ferramentas on-line e gratuitas para produção de infovis e utilização de tecnologia de atualização contínua dos dados visualizados. The research {{seeks to}} offer new contributions {{for studies on}} journalistic infographics by investigating the qualities, professional activities, and technologies involved {{in the production of}} an emerging form of infographics, the infovis, {{within the context of the}} potential of online environments, in synch with contemporary communications practices, and which overcomes, in certain aspects, previous infographics models. In order to meet our research objective, we employed a two-stage method: 1) conceptual review of three fundamental theoretical subjects - information visualization, journalistic infographics, and interactivity; and 2) a proposal for the analysis of infovis based on the technique of content analysis research. Thus, the empirical corpus is made up of 270 examples of infovis with political thematic content, mainly electoral, from four journalistic websites - The New York Times, The <b>Guardian,</b> Folha de <b>S.</b> Paulo and O Estado de S. Paulo - published between January 2010 and December 2013. Based on a systematic procedure for analysis, organized by analytical units and subunits, as well as by the three theoretical facets of the infovis device (input, interface and output), we obtained codified responses for all pieces within the corpus. From the reading of the completed analysis form, results and inferences were generated for our sample, which point to pioneering productive features in infographics, such as greater communicative openness with the audience, use of free online tools for the production of infovis, and use of real-time technology for on-screen dat...|$|R
