40|$|Abstract. Array antennas {{have the}} {{potential}} to increase the capacity of wireless networks, but a distributed beamforming algorithm for maximiz-ing the capacity in asynchronous, decentralized mobile ad hoc networks is yet to be found. In this paper we pursue an interference avoidance policy, based upon channel reciprocity in time-division duplexing, and arrive at a practical signaling technique for array antenna enhanced ad hoc networks in multi-path environments with fading. The beamforming scheme may be incorporated in an RTS-CTS-data-ACK based medium access control protocol without necessitating any exchange of channel state information. In computer simulations we find that the interference avoidance effectively bounds the packet transmission disruption prob-ability, and that the resulting single <b>hop</b> <b>transport</b> capacity increases almost linearly with the number of antennas under certain conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{transport}} energy {{is the most}} transparent theoretical approach to describe <b>hopping</b> <b>transport</b> in disordered systems with steeply energy dependent density of states (DOS), in particular in organic semiconductors with Gaussian DOS.

40|$|We {{developed}} an analytical model to describe <b>hopping</b> <b>transport</b> in organic semiconductors including both energetic disorder and polaronic contributions due to geometric relaxation. The model {{is based on}} a Marcus jump rate in terms of the small-polaron concept with a Gaussian energetic disorder, and it is premised upon a generalized effective medium approach yet avoids shortcomings involved in the effective transport energy or percolation concepts. It is superior to our previous treatment [Phys. Rev. B 76 045210 (2007) ] since it is applicable at arbitrary polaron activation energy Ea with respect to the energy disorder parameter σ. It can be adapted to describe both charge-carrier mobility and triplet exciton diffusion. The model is compared with results from Monte Carlo simulations. We show (i) that the activation energy of the thermally activated <b>hopping</b> <b>transport</b> can be decoupled into disorder and polaron contributions whose relative weight depend nonlinearly on the σ/Ea ratio, and (ii) that the choice of the density of occupied and empty states considered in configurational averaging has a profound effect on the results of calculations of the Marcus <b>hopping</b> <b>transport.</b> The σ/Ea ratio governs also the carrier-concentration dependence of the charge-carrier mobility in the large-carrier-concentration transport regime as realized in organic field-effect transistors. The carrier-concentration dependence becomes considerably weaker when the polaron energy increases relative to the disorder energy, indicating the absence of universality.
