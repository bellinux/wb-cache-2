500|$|Largely due to {{band member}} Régine Chassagne's Haitian ancestry, the band {{has tried to}} raise support and {{awareness}} for the socio-economic problems in Haiti throughout their career. The Haitian people had 15,000 dollars donated to them on November 5, 2005. On December 26, 2006, they supported Haitian charity organization Partners In Health by releasing the song [...] "Intervention" [...] on iTunes and donating the proceeds. However, they accidentally uploaded [...] "Black Wave/Bad Vibrations", the track after [...] "Intervention" [...] on Neon Bible. While the song was quickly removed once the problem was discovered, file sharers quickly circulated it on various P2P networks. On his blog, Win Butler quipped, [...] "I guess <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> charming that we can send the wrong song {{to the whole world}} with a click of a mouse... Oh well." ...|$|E
500|$|Some have {{wondered}} if an anti-Christian sentiment lurks behind the thefts. Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What it means is that it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing itand on January 2 they become good Christians again." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{rights for}} The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Brad Pitt's {{production}} company Plan B Entertainment, {{in association with}} New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came out in a paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... I mean, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky." [...] Gary Westfahl quoted Hubbard's work in a book of noteworthy science fiction quotations, Science Fiction Quotations: From the Inner Mind to the Outer Limits (2005).|$|E
500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{he later}} told The New York Times [...] "I guess <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a storybook ending. [...] When {{you think about}} where I was and where I am now, it seems pretty incredible." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{started at}} the top. My first {{professional}} acting role was in a starring role in a Universal Studios film," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't even {{get the chance to}} get my feet wet. So after that film, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a downward path." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have never met her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I think this is what happened to my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a recent}} interview, Tyler responded to such criticisms:”For one thing I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> true. I would say piss and vinegar for [...] Roth {{and for me}} milk and cookies. I can’t deny it…. [...] there’s more edge under some of my soft {{language}} than people realize.” [...] Because almost all of Tyler’s work covers the same territory—family and marriage relationships—and {{are located in the}} same setting, she has come under criticism for being repetitive and formulaic. [...] Reviewing The Patchwork Planet, Kakutani states: “Ms. Tyler's earlier characters tended to be situated within a thick matrix of finely nuanced familial relationships that helped define both their dreams and their limitations; the people in this novel, in contrast, seem much more like lone wolves, pulled this way and that by the author's puppet strings….Ms. Tyler’s famous ability to limn the daily minutiae of life also feels weary and formulaic this time around….As for the little details Ms. Tyler sprinkles over her story…they, too, have a paint-by-numbers touch. They add up to a patchwork novel that feels hokey, mechanical [...] [...] [...] and yes, too cute.|$|E
60|$|I have {{dictated}} to {{a typewriter}} before--but not autobiography. Between that {{experience and the}} present one there lies a mighty gap--more than thirty years! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> lifetime. In that wide interval much has happened--to the type-machine {{as well as to}} the rest of us. At the beginning of that interval a type-machine was a curiosity. The person who owned one was a curiosity, too. But now it is the other way about: the person who DOESN'T own one is a curiosity. I saw a type-machine for the first time in--what year? I suppose it was 1873--because Nasby was with me at the time, and it was in Boston. We must have been lecturing, or we could not have been in Boston, I take it. I quitted the platform that season.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interesting}} thing about the guitar solo <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> recorded after we had already finished [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an afterthought. That whole section was recorded in a different studio and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> slotted in the middle. If you notice, the whole sound of the guitar is different.|$|R

50|$|Dick Irvin, {{formerly}} the coach in Montreal, whom Habs' GM Frank Selke Sr. found a little truculent, {{took over as}} coach in Chicago, but could not {{get them out of}} the cellar, though they did improve. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a homecoming for Irvin as he started his coaching career with Chicago in 1930.|$|R
500|$|Nixon did not sport the {{outrageous}} fashions of the 1970s, {{because she was}} concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose.

I avoid the spectacular." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Ballad of 'Oh Boy'", as Sherman called <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a reading-and-response song, {{in which}} Sherman merely says the phrase [...] "Oh Boy" [...] with differing inflections to express {{different}} reactions, for example: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "That voice. It's an {{extraordinary}} voice," [...] said U2's lead singer Bono in 2003. [...] "I often tell him I think he's a crooner, and he doesn't like that very much.

5000|$|Despite these subtle logical problems, it {{is quite}} common to anticipatorily use the term {{definition}} (without apostrophes) for [...] "definitions" [...] of this kind, firstly because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a short-hand of the two-step approach, secondly because the relevant mathematical reasoning (step 2.) is the same in both cases, and finally because in mathematical texts the assertion is «up to 100%» true.|$|E
5000|$|... "Wildsurf" [...] {{has very}} much a summery feel to it. Tim once said of it: [...] "I was reading Jack Kerouac's 'On The Road' while {{we were on the}} road and it really {{inspired}} this song.

5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{gave the}} song two stars out of five, saying that [...] "If you’ve got spring break plans that involve suntan lotion and sexy strangers willing to rub it in, Bryan has your soundtrack.
