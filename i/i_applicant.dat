40|$|Gale and Shapley (1962) {{proposed}} the deferred-acceptance algorithm for matching (<b>i)</b> college <b>applicants</b> and colleges and (ii) men and women. In {{the case of}} the latter, it produces either one or two stable matches whereby no man and woman would prefer to be matched with each other rather than with their present partners. But stable matches can give one or both players in a pair their worst match, whereas the minimax algorithm that we propose, which finds all assignments that minimize the maximum rank of players in matches, avoids such assignments. Although minimax matches may not be stable, at least one is always Pareto-optimal: No other matching is at least as good for all the players and better for one or more. If there are multiple minimax matches, we propose criteria for choosing the most desirable among them and also discuss the settings in which minimax matches seem more compelling than deferred-acceptance matches when they differ. Finally, we calculate the probability that minimax matches differ from deferred-acceptance matches in a simple case. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} extent to which college quality affects students’ learning, {{employment}} and earnings in Colombia. Scores on a national college entry test solely determine admission to many selective Colombian universities, creating exogenous peer and resource quality variation near admission cutoffs. Two regression discontinuity (RD) approaches identify the local effect of peers and resources on student outcomes. In one RD approach <b>I</b> use <b>applicant</b> lists for Los Andes University, a top-ranked selective college, and find that relative to applicants below the cutoff, those just above score 0. 2 standard deviations higher on a standardized, field-specific college exit test, are 16 % more likely to be employed after college and earn 20 % more, with the strongest effects for low-income applicants. In the second RD approach I infer the entry testscore cutoffs for 25 nationwide selective universities and compare end-of-college learning based on exit tests for students in the same city and field just above and below the cutoff. The second approach produces a range of end-of-college learning effects that I relate to input differences.

40|$|Social class {{describes}} individuals’ {{possession of}} economic, social, and cultural capital, and their subjective social rankings relative to others (Bourdieu, 1984). As social class {{can be easily}} detected, it is quite likely that it {{plays a significant role}} in many workplace processes, such as selection. By considering the context of the hiring process, my dissertation explores the impact of social class from the perspective of hiring managers. First, I conducted a construct clarity study to clarify the multidimensional nature of the construct of social class. Second, using the factors found from my construct clarity study, <b>I</b> developed <b>applicant</b> stimulus materials (e. g., referral email, resume, video interviews) representative of three stages of the hiring process (e. g., acquiring, screening, and interviewing). Stimulus materials were presented to 78 participants in the acquiring stage, 105 participants in the screening stage, and 220 participants in the interviewing stage. Results of this dissertation find that hiring managers’ perceptions of applicant P-O fit are influenced by applicants’ social class. These effects are found during the acquiring stage and decrease in significance and prevalence as the hiring process progresses. Implications to research and practice as well as future directions for continued research on social class in the management literature are presented...|$|R

40|$|International audience– This paper aims to {{investigate}} the impact of brand attachment and familiarity on perceived congruence between the logo and the brand. It explores {{the role of an}} under-researched factor, surprise, on perceived congruence {{in the case of a}} radical logo change. Design/methodology/approach – A study was conducted with 220 students following a university logo change. Perceived congruence betweenthe logos (old and new) and the school brand values was measured for two kinds of students, current and future (<b>i.</b> e. <b>applicants).</b> Findings – Results show the importance of surprise in the acceptance of a logo change. Brand familiarity and brand attachment affect surprise inopposite ways, such that higher familiarity increases negative surprise, whereas higher attachment enhances positive surprise. Research limitations/implications – This research used a school logo. Because schools represent a particular type of company, brand attachmentto another type of brand could be different. The current model needs to be tested in different contexts. Practical implications – Companies must pay special attention when communicating with their most attached consumers. In particular, companiesthat aim to change their logos must prepare for the change by relying on communications that can lead to positive surprise. Originality/value – This study was conducted in a real context of logo change. It is the first study to focus on the link among familiarity, attachmentand surprise when a radical logo change takes place within a company...|$|R
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{contribution}} of different channels of knowledge transfer on innovation output, measured by patent production. The study verifies whether there exists a productivity increase in innovation activity induced by inventor-firm networks and inventors’ mobility. On the one hand, we measure the size of interfirm-networks that originate through researchers’ employment relationships; in other words, we observe each firm’s ties (to other firms) originated by {{the contribution of}} its researchers to other firms’ patents (variable Networks). Secondly, we study the transfer of knowledge occurring through the mobility of researchers/innovators (variable Mobility). We use two different measures of Networks. A first proxy of Networks of any <b>applicant</b> <b>i</b> at time t is made by summing up the number of inventors (“shared” inventors) listed in correspondence of any patent application of this applicant at time t, and participating, at the same t, in patent applications of other applicants. A second measure of Networks is given {{by the number of}} applicants to which <b>applicant</b> <b>i</b> is “connected” to, at time t, by means of each “shared” inventor. Mobility is defined as the number of inventors having applied for a patent, at time t, with any applicant, but not having shared in the past any other patent application with the same applicant; on the contrary, they need to have contributed to other applicants’ patents. In other words, an inventor, who has been already listed in the dataset in correspondence to a patent filed some years before, is considered mobile if he collaborates, in a given year, to a patent filed by an applicant with whom he did not cooperate in the past. Resuming the debate on the localization of knowledge transfer and the existence of productivity lags, the paper focuses on the role played by geographical proximity, and on the dynamic effects of knowledge flows. The geographical issue is faced at a very detailed level; we measure knowledge flows observed within the same Local Labor System (Intra-LLS), between different LLSs of the region (Inter-LLSs) and from LLSs outside the region (Extra-region) ...|$|R
