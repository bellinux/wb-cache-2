40|$|This {{research}} places self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> pessimism (comprising <b>defensive</b> expectations <b>and</b> reflectivity) into {{a single}} conceptual and analytic framework that models the full self-protective process across time. Data on two occasions collected during students' (n = 328) first two years at university show: performance orientation positively predicts self-handicapping, <b>defensive</b> expectations, <b>and</b> reflectivity; task-orientation negatively predicts self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> expectations <b>and</b> positively predicts reflectivity; uncertain personal control positively predicts <b>defensive</b> expectations <b>and</b> reflectivity; and an external attributional orientation positively predicts self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> expectations. Although both self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> expectations negatively affect academic outcomes, {{the negative effects of}} self-handicapping were more marked. In contrast to these counter-productive strategies, reflectivity had positive effects on academic engagement. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} <b>defensive</b> <b>and</b> failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, <b>defensive,</b> <b>and</b> neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is <b>defensive</b> <b>and</b> healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{centrally}} concerned with self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> pessimism (comprising <b>defensive</b> expectations <b>and</b> reflectivity), the factors that predict these strategies, and the associations between these strategies {{and a variety of}} academic outcomes. Major findings are that task orientation negatively predicts both self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> expectations <b>and</b> positively predicts reflectivity; uncertain personal control positively predicts <b>defensive</b> expectations, <b>and</b> to a lesser extent, self-handicapping; and an external attributional orientation is positively associated with self-handicapping, and to a lesser extent, defensive expectations. Both self-handicapping <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> expectations are negatively associated with self-regulation and persistence, whereas reflectivity is positively associated with these outcomes. Students high in self-handicapping received lower end-of-year grades than did students low in self-handicapping and {{were less likely to be}} in attendance 1 year later...|$|R

After Germany's defeat, Nautilus was demilitarized and used as a hulk from 1921 to 1928 before being sold for scrap and broken up in Copenhagen.|$|E

Taylor's two interceptions tied the Georgia bowl record for interceptions, first set by Scott Woerner and Ronnie Harris. The four Virginia Tech turnovers resulted in 18Georgiapoints.

5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one <b>defensive</b> <b>and</b> the other offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action {{to clear the}} ball in the direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Great War {{had been}} ongoing {{for almost two}} years, during which anarchists had taken part in anti-war {{movements}} across Europe, issuing numerous anti-war statements in anarchist and leftist publications. In February 1915, a statement was issued by an assembly of anarchists from various regions, including England, Switzerland, Italy, the United States, Russia, France, and the Netherlands. The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a <b>defensive</b> <b>and</b> offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a means by which to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the <b>defensive,</b> <b>and</b> avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The last century of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border remained stable until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references(pages 233 - 235) This thesis {{develops}} {{and presents}} a mathematical simulation for application to professional football. The results of individual plays {{are determined by}} matching the abilities and ratings of the opposing players and teams and the strategies of the opposing coaches. Any play may be affected {{by as many as}} nine variables,including, field position, two offensive <b>and</b> two <b>defensive</b> strategies, offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> formations <b>and</b> offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> ratings for the play. The importance of strategy having between 70 and 80 percent control over the outcome of a play - means that a unique body of theory may be developed for guiding coaches in play selection. The available offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> strategies total 168 combinations each. A section of this thesis, making assumptions about the character of the field position, offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> ratings <b>and</b> offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> formations - all the variables except the play selections - analyzes the relative attractiveness of the available offensive <b>and</b> <b>defensive</b> strategies independent of opposition's strategy.
