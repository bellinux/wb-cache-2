5|$|Marinić led {{other people}} from Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka by {{improving}} the living {{conditions of the}} children, decorating the walls, feeding them and treating their illnesses. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the helpers to earn {{the trust of the}} children due to their harsh treatment {{at the hands of the}} Ustaše, but gradually their health began to improve. These helpers lived in the camp and at the sub-camp with the children.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Potassium metal {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered voltaic pile. Potassium {{was the first}} metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Later in the same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from a mineral derivative (caustic soda, NaOH, or lye) rather than a plant salt, by a similar technique, demonstrating that the elements, and thus the salts, are different. Although the production of potassium and sodium metal should have shown that both are elements, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before this view was universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{before a}} Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was}} not recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general assumption is that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E

60|$|Broadly, {{the phase}} {{in which the}} Victorian epoch closed was {{what can only be}} called the Imperialist phase. Between that and us stands a very {{individual}} artist who must nevertheless be connected with that phase. As I said at the beginning, Macaulay (or, rather, the mind Macaulay shared with most of his powerful middle class) remains as a sort of pavement or flat foundation under all the Victorians. They discussed the dogmas rather than denied them. Now one of the dogmas of Macaulay was the dogma of progress. A fair statement of the truth in it is not really so hard. Investigation of anything naturally <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> little <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to sort letters so as to find a letter: <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to test a gas-bracket so as to find the leak; <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to sift evidence so as to find the truth. Now the curse that fell on the later Victorians was this: that they began to value the time more than the truth. One felt so secretarial when sorting letters that one never found the letter; one felt so scientific in explaining gas that one never found the leak; and one felt so judicial, so impartial, in weighing evidence that one had to be bribed to come to any conclusion at all. This was the last note of the Victorians: procrastination was called progress.|$|R

25|$|Geological {{evidence}} for ice ages comes in various forms, including rock scouring and scratching, glacial moraines, drumlins, valley cutting, and the deposition of till or tillites and glacial erratics. Successive glaciations tend to distort and erase the geological evidence, {{making it difficult}} to interpret. Furthermore, this evidence was difficult to date exactly; early theories assumed that the glacials were short compared to the long interglacials. The advent of sediment and ice cores revealed the true situation: glacials are long, interglacials short. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the current theory to be worked out.|$|E

In 1863, 215 officers were arrested for being intoxicated while on duty, In 1872 there was a police strike, and during 1877 three high ranking detectives were tried for corruption at the Old Bailey. Due to this latter scandal the Detective Branch was re-organised in 1878 by C. E. Howard Vincent, and renamed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). This was separated from the uniformed branch and its head had {{direct access to the}} Home Secretary, by-passing the Commissioner.|$|E

Initial training was only very rudimentary in nature, consisting mainly of drill and basic signals. Lacking vehicles, at the outset only limited driver training could be undertaken using private vehicles. Finally, on 13 November a quantity of weapons arrived for individual training and two days later a number utility vehicles and lorries arrived. More involved signals and driver training followed and on 23 November, the regiment was inspected by the divisional commander, Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey.|$|E

25|$|The {{move to the}} Isthmian League {{coincided with}} a time of {{financial}} strife at the club. The club finished in {{the bottom half of the}} division during their first five seasons in the league, as the club struggled to attract players of a sufficient quality. The club were not helped by corruption behind the scenes — some supposedly amateur players were receiving salaries, and when this emerged, the club were barracked by the local press. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> for the clouds to disperse, and the result was the departure of Scott. The late 1960s saw the arrival of Vince Burgess as manager. Led by Burgess, Hitchin finished as Isthmian League runners-up in 1968–69 and won the London Senior Cup a year later. The success brought by Burgess then dissipated as soon as it had appeared, as Burgess left the club in 1970. Hitchin did, however, win the East Anglian Cup in 1972–73.|$|E
25|$|Their {{movement}} {{into the region}} may have set off a Near East mass migration sometime around 1900 BC. The dominant indigenous inhabitants in central Anatolia {{at the time were}} Hurrians and Hattians who spoke non-Indo-European languages (some have argued that Hattic was a Northwest Caucasian language, but its affiliation remains uncertain), whilst the Hurrian language was a language isolate. There were also Assyrian colonies in the region during the Old Assyrian Empire (2025-1750 BC); it was from the Semitic Assyrians of Upper Mesopotamia that the Hittites adopted the cuneiform script. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before the Hittites established themselves following the collapse of the Old Assyrian Empire in the mid-18th century BC, as is clear from some of the texts included here. For several centuries there were separate Hittite groups, usually centered on various cities. But then strong rulers with their center in Hattusas (modern Boğazköy) succeeded in bringing these together and conquering large parts of central Anatolia to establish the Hittite kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Grenadier and the Light {{infantry}} companies {{moved forward}} {{to support the}} Rangers while the Royal Scots came forward on rising ground {{to the right of}} the Cherokee.

Montgomerie now extended his line on the left with the Highlanders, who turned the Indian right. The Indians retired from this advance and came into contact with the Royal Scots in a brisk encounter from which they retreated to a position on a hill from which they could not be dislodged. Montgomerie ordered an advance through the pass and on to the town, but some of the Cherokee ran to warn the inhabitants to leave. Some of the warriors had got around his flanks and attacked his pack animals and supply train whose loss would cripple the army. This attack was eventually driven off.|$|E

Another relevant time lag is the lag between the materialization of the above-mentioned decision (causing the capital assets to work well below the level of their full employment) and the decrease of the excessive amounts of commodities accumulated in inventories. Yet, after this decrease takes place one can observe the conditions for a new phase of growth of demand, prices, output, etc.|$|R
