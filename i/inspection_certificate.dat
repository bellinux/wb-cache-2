40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} hurricane mitigation features on the transaction prices of singlefamily homes. Some of these features are obvious to the casual observer (known) and others can only be revealed through costly verification (revealed). Merging a dataset that includes information on single-family properties in Miami-Dade County with a database of insured properties from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, we look at whether hurricane mitigation features are priced by the market. We are able to contrast the impact of observed features with unobserved features {{as well as the}} impact of verification through an <b>inspection</b> <b>certificate.</b> Our results indicate that mitigation information is valued by market participants; known features typically “bundled ” with revealed features dominate the pricing mechanism; and that the <b>inspection</b> <b>certificate</b> provided to the seller is priced consistent with capitalized value associated with the reduction in premiums. The strength of these findings is bolstered {{by the fact that the}} effect of mitigation features may be somewhat overshadowed by distressed market conditions...|$|E

40|$|O consumo de verduras cruas desempenha importante papel na transmissão de várias doenças infecciosas pela freqüente prática de irrigação de hortas com água contaminada. O objetivo deste estudo é a avaliação das condições higiênico-sanitárias de todas as hortas produtoras de verduras de Ribeirão Preto, SP com implantação de um sistema de fiscalização. A análise laboratorial de 129 hortas revelou irregularidades em 20, 1 % delas, destacando-se elevada concentração de coliformes fecais em 17 %, presença de Salmonella em 3, 1 % e de vários enteroparasitas (Ascaris sp, Ancylostomidae, Strongyloides sp, Hymenolepis nana e Giardia sp) em 13, 1 %. A repetição da análise das hortas irregulares determinou a interdição definitiva de uma delas; todas as demais foram aprovadas, comprovando a eficácia do sistema de fiscalização, particularmente com a implantação, inédita no país, do certificado de vistoria sanitária. The ingesting of raw {{vegetables}} {{plays an}} important role in the transmission of several infectious diseases due to the high frequency of irrigation with wastewater. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sanitary conditions of all lettuce producing crops in Ribeirão Preto through microbiological and parasitological analysis of both irrigation water and lettuce together with the implantation of an effective crop monitoring. Laboratory analysis of 129 crops showed irregularities in 26 (20. 1 %) of these: high concentration of fecal coliforms in 17 % of the lettuce, presence of Salmonella in 3. 1 % and several enteroparasites (Ascaris sp, Ancylostomidae, Strongyloides sp, Hymenolepis nana, and Giardia sp) in 13. 1 %. Persistent irregularities determined the definitive closing down of one producer; all of the remaining 128 crops were eventually approved, thus demonstrating the efficacy of lettuce crop monitoring. Crops approved in the laboratory analysis were awarded a Sanitary <b>Inspection</b> <b>Certificate</b> - an unprecedented procedure in our Country - that resulted in a better acceptance of the monitoring...|$|E
