At the National Land Survey (NLS), the term “The integrated cadastral system of Sweden ” is used. This means that the whole <b>infrastructure,</b> the <b>registered</b> and presented property information (land, owners, users, houses etc.), is integrated with its geographic location. These data cover the whole nation, {{but they are not}} stored in a single database. Several authorities (i. e. Municipalities, Taxation authorities, and NLS) maintain the database infrastructure. The cadastral data are linked with unique identities in order to work in a uniform system for presentation and analyses. The word Cadastral refers to land ownership information. This information has references to location of the parcels. In Sweden, the word has a more general meaning. It includes a lot of other information connected to the land parcel, like ownership and rights to land, taxation information, buildings and real property information, mortgages, plans, regulations etc...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{connected}} government is coming {{once again to}} the forefront of national development priorities around the world. This stems from the need to address various local and global necessities in light of the changing landscape of the new digital world we live in today. In a connected government context, public service agencies are needed to act as a single enterprise so that citizens feel they are being served by one organization rather than a number of different public authorities. Identity management is considered here a fundamental pillar to enable such operating models and support single sign-on (SSO) and online identity validation capabilities for e-government and e-commerce environments. This article explores and describes the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government integration strategy with relation to keeping its national identity management <b>infrastructure</b> (population <b>register)</b> updated as life events take place. The integration strategy also aims to support federal and local government entities to verify citizen and resident information using their own applications in a secure, reliable, and integrated manner. Another expected contribution of the integration platform is to support decision-making and strategic planning dimensions of government work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Accounting {{is an old}} {{term that}} defines the {{activity}} of keeping records of the money. However, accounting in the Internet implies not only economic principles, but also engineering aspects. Accounting {{has been used for}} studying the impact on usage quotas, for dimensioning a provider <b>infrastructure</b> or for <b>registering</b> the data flow, among others. Each evolutionary step of the Internet has its implications in how the accounting process is performed. The new challenges of the Future Internet and the Next-Generation Networks (NGN) reveal the need of a revision of the accounting process. Against this background, we present a taxonomy of the accounting process of the Internet. This taxonomy classifies all the functions involved in accounting in a hierarchical structure, representing their behaviour. The resulting taxonomy helps defining the terminology, requirements and working framework of all the accounting-related studies. Further, it helps through the learning, teaching and assessing process in the area of accounting. Keywords-Accounting; Internet; Taxonomy. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of {{registers}} in population, households and housing censuses in Slovenia. A short background on history and current development of register-based statistics in Slovenia is presented. The <b>infrastructure</b> of administrative <b>registers</b> (the Central Population Register, the Business Register, the Register of Territorial Units with geo-coded addresses and universally used identification numbers) has been developed taking into account the experiences of the Nordic countries. Administrative registers and records in Slovenia were already used in the 1991 census and they are planned to be used as much as possible in the 2001 Census. The Act on National Statistics provides the legal base for the access to administrative records at micro level, their linkage by use of the ID numbers and development of the statistical registers as an intermediate flexible tool for production of statistics. The Act on Organisation and the Field of Work of the Ministries (1994) stipulates that the Ministries set up, keep, maintain and provide horizontal linkage of data records within their authority into common data bases which serve fo...|$|R

40|$|The European Urban Health Indicators System Project Part 2 (EURO-URHIS 2) is a cross-national {{study that}} was {{implemented}} in Europe. It {{consists of four}} data collection tools that were specifically developed to collect health data at an urban level. This paper reviews some of the methodological constraints in adapting the EURO-URHIS 2 study in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. No attempt to extend the original study beyond Europe has been reported before. Cultural, political, economic and social differences create specific obstacles as well as challenges. This paper sets out how these challenges were addressed, examining key aspects of the methodology, including study design, translation of the questionnaire and data collection. It {{was found that the}} EURO-URHIS 2 adult data collection tool methodology could not be replicated in Vietnam. A lack of basic <b>infrastructure</b> and population <b>registers</b> led to significant changes being made to the sampling and survey administration. It was recommended that the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was used as the replacement method. Despite the limitations in using the EPI method, the overall strengths and benefits were found to address methodological issues and the resource poor settin...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} productivity impacts of the provision of <b>infrastructure</b> on the <b>registered</b> manufacturing sector in India. This is analyzed by estimating the cost elasticity of infrastructure inputs. For this purpose we postulate a variable cost function model for the manufacturing sector with cost {{as a function of}} the prices of the variable inputs, levels of output and infrastructure stocks. Variable inputs include capital, labour and intermediate input. Infrastructure is assumed to be a quasi-fixed input since its provision is done mainly by the public sector and it cannot be instantaneously adjusted in the short-run. The cost function model estimated consists of the variable translog cost function and the cost share equations for the variable inputs. We have used time series data and it pertains to the period 1965 - 1999. Twenty-three infrastructure variables are used in this study which, are aggregated using the principal component methodology. Three alternative specifications of the quasi-fixed inputs are explored. The alternatives are economic infrastructure, social infrastructure and aggregate infrastructure. Estimated results suggest that infrastructure provision enhances the productivity in the manufacturing sector and it helps to lower the costs in the sector. Apart from this it also has several bias effects with respect to the variable inputs. ...|$|R

The current developed febris monitoring system consists of a WBN based Arduino module connected with two electronic medical sensors (i. e. a temperature sensor and a pulse sensor) soldered {{on one end of}} the separated tiny cable; a smartphone device, internet access and the end user terminal. In practice, two kind of electronic boards (Arduino Uno board and 2. 4 GHz seed Bluetooth shield board) were stacked in such away to assembly a typical WBN system as depicted in Fig. 1. The WBN operates and connects to the internet <b>infrastructure</b> via the <b>registered</b> mobile phone using the Bluetooth data transfer mechanism. Through the optimization of the attractive technology allows the data transfer up to 460, 800 bps. On the later study, the whole WBN design would be integrated to the intelligent E-Health network. The current development of E-Health network allows the patient and the physician/doctor to interactively communicate anytime from anywhere at a remote location.

However, local development of the road and parking <b>infrastructure</b> did not <b>register</b> the same ascendant tendency, and, consequently, cities, including Craiova, presently confronts with numerous traffic problems. The Geographic Information System allows the interpretation of statistical data referring to the values registered by urban road traffic on different time intervals (daily, seasonally, and multi-annually) through the achievement of thematic layers that may suggestively render the intervals and perimeters where traffic jams frequently occur. It also allows the estimation of the movement speed of the auto vehicles on different road portions and the impact traffic lights or roundabouts have upon the speed distances are covered, which may eventually lead us to a better management of an integrated system of the urban road traffic. By applying the index of the probability of traffic jam occurrence, one may give some recommendations with regard to the necessity of one way roads and/or traffic lights and roundabouts, also integrating the variables offered by alternative means of transport (public transportation, bicycle tracks). According to the analysis achieved in GIS, the sustainability capacity of the road traffic in Craiova city is overtaken in terms of road infrastructure quality and quantity, lack of cycling tracks, insufficiency of parking places, and inadequate offer of public transportation. Besides the initial analysis, the utilization of GIS also allows th...|$|R
40|$|Compiling {{benchmark}} {{supply and}} use tables provides for any country {{one of the}} best ways to cross-check a great number of statistical sources. It is therefore a tool of diagnosis of a system of official statistical surveys and can point at main loopholes and the necessary directions for the development of future data sources. It is not only because providing annual supply and use tables is a requirement for present and future members of the European Union, it is also because cross-checking of sources provides statistical synergy and firmer construction of an official statistical system as a whole. It is even more important in a situation of a very dynamic change in statistical sources that characterises countries in transition. Their statistical sources display, because of common historical legacy, a number of similar structural deficiencies. Based on Slovenian experience in compiling supply and use tables according to ESA 95 and P 60 CPA / A 60 NACE Rev. 1 format, the main deficiencies are the lack of surveys of values of intermediate inputs, the lack of general structural business survey of establishments and a deficient coverage of a system of price indexes. There is an abundance of detailed data on quantities, instead of values and prices. And there is a very sparse statistical coverage of services, but this is also a problem in developed countries. Then there are also more fundamental weaknesses in statistical <b>infrastructure</b> like business <b>registers,</b> classifications and organisation, which all finally reflect in a fact, that supply and use tables remain more a data model composed of assumptions and less a data fact. It is especially bothersome if they are to be used to provide check of GDP estimates or to be a better way to make them. A mirror image of problems is a set of proposed solutions...|$|R
