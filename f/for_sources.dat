5|$|It {{is likely}} that Native Americans living along the Columbia River as early as 10,000years ago visited the Bull Run {{watershed}} in search of food. Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{methodology}} {{has proven}} to be a weakness in many sourcing initiatives. This research is an attempt to rationalize the decisions decision-makers often intuitively make. The following question is addressed in this research: How can one decide which domains in an enterprise are favorable candidates <b>for</b> <b>sourcing?</b> To this end, the concept of a domain that is useful <b>for</b> <b>sourcing</b> decision-making is introduced, as well as a system to assign a score <b>for</b> favorability <b>for</b> <b>sourcing</b> to a domain. Furthermore, criteria <b>for</b> <b>sourcing</b> are uncovered, and ordered based on their distinguishing power and level of dif?culty of checking. On the basis of this ordering, a stepwise decision-making model is introduced, which provides a relatively quick way of determining the favorability of a domain <b>for</b> <b>sourcing.</b> Information ArchitectureSoftware TechnologyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

25|$|Humans {{were already}} reliant on {{domestic}} {{plants and animals}} when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. For example, {{despite the fact that}} hunters of the Near Eastern gazelle in the Epipaleolithic avoided culling reproductive females to promote population balance, neither gazelles nor zebras possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.|$|E

The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, {{was the first of the}} precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000). Cavendish worked with his instrument makers, generally improving existing instruments rather than inventing wholly new ones.|$|E

25|$|Nutrient bioextraction is {{bioremediation}} involving cultured {{plants and}} animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is {{the practice of}} farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies. It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries. Additionally, studies have demonstrated seaweed's potential to improve nitrogen levels.|$|E
25|$|Putnam County {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Civil War. One third of the county's men between the ages of 15 and 55 served in the military during the war years. During the post-Civil War years, industry and agriculture suffered losses as the economy contracted. Iron, which was produced in the Highland Mountains, could be found elsewhere. Agriculture was also affected greatly. The increasing need for drinking water in New York City led the city to search <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> in the Hudson Valley. In Putnam County, much of the farmland was flooded to create reservoirs. The abandoning of farms, the creation of reservoirs, and the preservation of the remaining open land resulted in scenic lands that drew large amounts of tourism from New York City.|$|E
25|$|The rabbit tick is {{extremely}} host specific {{and in its}} search for a host will climb onto vegetation. The tick will look for vegetation that is {{the height of the}} rabbit, , and is slightly curved. The rabbit tick, in this process, is attempting to orient itself to a range where it can find rabbits, birds, and small mammals. The rabbit tick prefers surfaces with a smaller diameter near the tip of the vegetation, but the diameter of the base of the vegetation has no effect on the vegetation choice. Once it finds a suitable position, the tick will become still and stretch out its tarsi to wait for a stimuli that a host is near. The tick has the ability to sense the carbon dioxide from a potential host as well as body temperature. When the rabbit tick finds the host it will either accept the host and begin to feed or reject the host and fall to the ground, repeating the process until it finds a suitable host. This process is summed up into two parts; physical environmental stimuli and host-emitted stimuli. Also, H. leporispalustris relies heavily on light and humidity for cues of a host. The tick will look <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> that are dry and prefers darker environments.|$|E

25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} are omnivores, and foragers {{are considered to}} be scavengers rather than predators. The ants' diet consists of dead mammals, arthropods, insects, earthworms, vertebrates, and solid food matter such as seeds. However, this species prefers liquid over solid food. The liquid food the ants collect is sweet substances from plants or honeydew-producing hemipterans. Arthropod prey may include dipteran adults, larvae and pupae, and termites. The consumption of sugar amino acid is known to affect recruitment of workers to plant nectars. Mimic plants with sugar rarely have workers to feed on them, whereas those with sugar and amino acids have considerable numbers. The habitats where they live may determine the food they collect the most; for example, forage success rates for solid foods are highest in lakeshore sites, while high levels of liquid sources were collected from pasture sites. Specific diets can also alter the growth of a colony, with laboratory colonies showing high growth if fed honey-water. Colonies that feed on insects and sugar-water can grow exceptionally large {{in a short period of}} time, whereas those that do not feed on sugar-water grow substantially slower. Colonies that do not feed on insects cease brood production entirely. Altogether, the volume of food digested by nestmates is regulated within colonies. Larvae are able to display independent appetites <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> such as solid proteins, amino acid solutions, and sucrose solutions, and they also prefer these sources over dilute solutions. Such behaviour is due to their capability to communicate hunger to workers. The rate of consumption depends on the type, concentration, and state of the food on which they feed. Workers tend to recruit more nestmates to food sources filled with high levels of sucrose than to protein.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of the Conquest of Peru, Prescott turned his mind to writing a history of Philip II of Spain, which he had been contemplating for several years. John Lothrop Motley, who planned to write an independent work on the subject, was aided by Prescott, who gave him access to his library. Although the two corresponded, there seems to have been little collaboration on their respective works. Prescott had started searching <b>for</b> <b>sources</b> as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II. [...] The principal archives of historical material were held in Simancas, but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the Conquest of Mexico) nor Middleton were able to gain access to them. They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained. However, Lembke, who as a diplomat had been expelled from Spain, made the acquaintance of two wealthy Parisian scholars, Mignet and Ternaux-Compans, who offered him access to their manuscript collections. Furthermore, de Gayangos assisted greatly by locating important documents in the British Museum and {{in the collection of the}} bibliomaniac Thomas Phillipps, who owned around 60,000manuscripts. He also borrowed several manuscripts from the archives in Brussels, having received letters from the respected Belgian diplomat Sylvain Van de Weyer in London. de Gayangos became Professor of Arabic literature at the Complutense University of Madrid in late 1842, and subsequently lent Prescott rare books and manuscripts from the university library. By the summer of 1848, Prescott had over 300 works on the subject at his disposal, but he continued to have serious problems with his eyesight; an examination by an oculist confirmed that there was untreatable damage to his retina. Prescott had been commissioned by the Massachusetts Historical Society to write a biography of the scholar John Pickering in 1848, which he wrote for publication later in that year. Prescott was invited to write a history of the Mexican–American War, but declined, as he was uninterested in writing on contemporary events.|$|E
