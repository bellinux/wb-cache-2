5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

25|$|Rüedi’s {{expectations}} {{regarding the}} New World, however, did not materialize. (Perhaps the medical infrastructure developed too slowly in <b>his</b> <b>eyes.)</b> <b>For</b> that reason Rüedi returned to Switzerland after {{only five years}} (1896).|$|E

25|$|Several years later, a king named Sagara magically {{acquired}} sixty thousand sons. One day, King Sagara {{performed a}} ritual of worship {{for the good}} of the kingdom. One of the integral parts of the ritual was a horse, which was stolen by the jealous Indra. Sagara sent all his sons all over the earth to search for the horse. They found it in the nether-world (or Underworld) next to a meditating sage Kapil tied by Lord Indra(the king of Swarg). Believing that the sage had stolen the horse, they hurled insults at him and caused his penance to be disturbed. The sage opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> the first time in several years and looked at the sons of Sagara. With this glance, all sixty thousand were burnt to death.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's eyebrow and nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not in line of sight to see this. Blood was pouring more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor examined it. A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with blood in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E
500|$|Animation on The Sorcerer's Apprentice {{began on}} January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the {{director}} of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem Der Zauberlehrling, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as [...] "brilliantly colored thumbnails" [...] from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> the first time to achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, [...] "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E
