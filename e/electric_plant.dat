The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the dairy building's tower) was unknown, and the damage was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary dairy in a room of the <b>electric</b> <b>plant</b> which had a boiler for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger dairy building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General <b>Electric</b> <b>plant</b> in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E

25|$|Coal-fired {{electric}} power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated, which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired <b>electric</b> <b>plant</b> per megawatt hour generated. Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen.

25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{prompted}} thinkers, such as Karl Marx {{with his}} theory of alienation, to concern themselves {{with the nature of}} work and its impact on workers. Taylor's (1911) Principles of Scientific Management as well as Mayo’s research in the late 1920s and early 1930s on workers at the Hawthorne Western <b>Electric</b> <b>plant</b> helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses.

25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from colza oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel <b>electric</b> <b>plant</b> was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E

The Owensboro plant was a major part of General Electric's vacuum tube manufacturing operations, producing both receiving types and military/industrial ceramic types.

In September 2010, the Winchester, Virginia, General <b>Electric</b> <b>plant</b> closed, leaving Osram Sylvania and the tiny American Light Bulb Manufacturing Inc. the last companies to make standard incandescent bulbs in the United States. At that time, Ellis Yan, whose Chinese company made the majority of CFLs sold in the United States, said {{he was interested in}} building a United States factory to make CFL bulbs, but wanted $12.5 million from the U.S. government to do so. General Electric had considered changing one of its bulb plants to make CFLs, but said that even after a $40 million investment in converting a plant, wage differences would mean costs would be 50% higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakthrough}} in industrial development came about in 1892 with the commissioning of the town’s <b>electric</b> <b>plant</b> (in operation until 1952). Within {{a few years}} {{a large number of}} industrial firms settled in town and Brugg experienced an economic boom. The town, however, soon found itself bumping against its small borders. Meanwhile, between 1898 and 1901, the Canton of Aargau forcibly merged twelve smaller communities against their will, as they no longer appeared to be economically viable as independent entities and could therefore not meet their legally prescribed duties and responsibilities. Altenburg found itself among this group. Although the final vote in the town meeting came down firmly against its cessation of independence (42 against versus 2 in favor), the Grand Council approved of its incorporation into Brugg on January 1, 1901. Brugg thus saw its surface area doubled.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Mike Howard, Squadron Commander, saw COIN as {{a process}} of {{providing}} three services in the Kamdesh region. Providing clean water by installing gravity fed pipelines in all the local villages, repairing the hydroelectric plants in Urmul and Kamdesh, and setting up new plants in Mirdesh and Gawardesh. New roads would be the final stage, built and maintained by local contractors, this would improve the local economy while providing improved communications with the central government {{and the rest of the}} nation. 1.33 million dollars was budgeted for these projects. This had the potential of providing a significant boost to the local economy, which in the past saw little in the way of civic improvements. Keating saw these programs as having mixed results. Villagers and clans who were left out of these projects were resentful, and quick to turn to those who would exploit the resulting divisions. Haji Yunus, a village elder of Gawardesh and contractor for an <b>electric</b> <b>plant</b> was kidnapped and murdered. A note was attached to his body which said: “Don’t work with coalition forces. This will happen to you.” The note was signed “Mullah Omar”. Omar was the top Taliban leader in Afghanistan, but U.S. Intelligence stated HIG had done the killing, giving Omar “credit” in order in instill more fear due to Omar’s greater reputation. The constant ambushes and fire fights along the road to Naray did little to relieve Keating’s doubts. “The little bastards keep shooting at us every day.”, represented Keating’s assessment of the progress of COIN in Kamdesh.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western <b>Electric</b> <b>plant</b> became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period. In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT into Lucent Technologies.|$|E
