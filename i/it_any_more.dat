500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, Ramsey named Charlton in his squad of 22 for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. However, he favoured Labone over Charlton and only picked Charlton for his 35th and final England game in the 1–0 group win over Czechoslovakia at the Estadio Jalisco. England lost in the quarter finals to West Germany, and on the flight home, Charlton asked Ramsey not to be {{considered}} for international duty again. Charlton agonised over how to break the news to Ramsey, and eventually said: [...] "Great times... absolute privilege... getting older... slowing down... not sure I am up to <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more...</b> time to step down." [...] Ramsey listened, then agreed with him. [...] "Yes, I had reached that conclusion myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] {{opens the}} album with the lines [...] "If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream/ Where {{immobile}} steel rims crack, and the ditch {{in the back}} roads stop [...] ", which according to Erik Hage shows Morrison had [...] "once and for all pulled neck and neck with Dylan as a lyricist". [...] Morrison described it as [...] "one of those songs {{where you can see}} {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel... I don't think I can elaborate on <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than that." [...] The words in the song: [...] "Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter/Showin' pictures on the wall" [...] appear to be based on Morrison's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived. (This was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview in 1978.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|Willy {{has always}} {{made the point}} to his sons that being popular and having {{contacts}} {{is the key to}} success. His older son, Biff, causes [...] "old hopes and boiling resentments" [...] to return by visiting home. Willy is loved by Biff, who nonetheless does not get along with him. [...] Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. “In fact, Willy's logical mind becomes blind…” Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. [...] This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul saying [...] "Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> I'm just what I am, that's all." [...] At Willy's funeral, Biff states that [...] "He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.".|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{is written}} in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and {{domestic}} fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion. Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers. The power {{in this type of}} writing {{can be seen in the}} reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: [...] "I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than I could have left a dying child." [...] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva. Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.|$|E

500|$|During the 1999 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as [...] "there {{is no way of}} checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: [...] "The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it." [...] Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that [...] "the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion." [...] Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: [...] "It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society." [...] Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.|$|E
