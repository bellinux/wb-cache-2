5|$|Throughout his life, Boydell {{dedicated}} time to civic projects: he donated art {{to government}} institutions {{and ran for}} public office. In 1790 he became Lord Mayor of London. The French Revolutionary Wars led to a cessation in Continental trade {{at the end of}} the 1790s and without this business, Boydell's firm declined and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> bankrupt at his death in 1804.|$|E
5|$|A Springfield native, Neal {{graduated}} from American International College {{and received a}} master's degree from the University of Hartford. After graduating he became involved in politics, working {{as an assistant to}} the mayor of Springfield.

5|$|Although Ruth knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> {{finished}} as a player, he {{desired to}} remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E

On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm {{was nearly}} 30 {{years old when}} he entered the major leagues, and pitched until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 50.

Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought he could have reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E

5|$|Charles X Gustav, with a {{force of}} 11,000 horse, reacted by {{pursuing}} Czarniecki's force of 2,400 men, confronting and defeating him in the Battle of Gołąb in February 1656. Charles X Gustav then intended to take Lwow, but his advance was halted in the Battle of Zamość, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> encircled by the growing Polish–Lithuanian armies under Sapieha and Czarniecki, and barely escaped on 5 and 6 April breaking through Sapieha's lines during the Battle of Sandomierz {{at the cost of}} his artillery and baggage. A Swedish relief force under Frederick of Baden was destroyed by Czarniecki on 7 April in the Battle of Warka. In the same month, John II Casimir with the Lwów Oath proclaimed Virgin Mary queen of Poland, and promised to lift the burdens inflicted on the peasantry if he regained control.|$|E
5|$|Eytel {{returned}} to Germany to study art for 18 months (1897–1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States. Wanting to be a cowboy, {{he worked as}} a cowhand in the San Joaquin Valley and in 1903 he would settle in Palm Springs. Living in small cabins he built himself, Palm Springs would remain his home. Eytel often walked on his travels, covering 400 miles in the Colorado Desert on foot. On one of his travels <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> lynched as a horse thief and in 1918, during a trip to northern Arizona, he was threatened with lynching as a German spy.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E

5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Seine, the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn to England in September 1944, but briefly served in the Ardennes in December during the Battle of the Bulge. Hill then commanded 3rd Parachute Brigade during Operation Varsity, the Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> killed by a glider containing his own personal Jeep. He then commandeered a motorcycle and rode alongside the brigade as the 6th Airborne Division advanced from the Rhine to the River Elbe, {{at the end of}} which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO as well as the American Silver Star. After the war, he was briefly military governor of Copenhagen, for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross, and also raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army). Retiring from the British Army in 1949, he became involved in a number of charities and businesses. He died on 16 March 2006, aged 95.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War in 1808, San Martín was named adjutant of Francisco María Solano Ortiz de Rosas. Rosas, suspected of being an afrancesado, was killed by a popular uprising which overran the barracks and dragged his corpse in the streets. San Martín was appointed to the armies of Andalucía, and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a guerrilla force led by Juan de la Cruz Mourgeón. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> killed during the battle of Arjonilla, but was saved by Sergeant Juan de Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the battle of Bailén, a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Martín was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the battle of Albuera under the command of general William Carr Beresford. By this time, the French armies held most of the Iberian Peninsula under their control, except for Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar {{had a great}} showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 {{a minivan}} {{collided}} with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E

5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} on the Spanish infantry, the Marquis del Vasto collected his cavalry and charged over Stanley's infantry, being in turn repelled. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> killed when an English soldier attacked him with a battleaxe, but a Spanish light horseman surnamed Arenas saved him by transfixing the English with his lance. Del Vasto retired from the fight and met Verdugo and Johann Baptista von Taxis, who sallied from Zutphen with several troops to join the battle. At the same time they were conversing, English troops unsuccessfully attacked Zutphen's sconce {{on the other side of}} the IJssel, which was defended by Count Herman van den Bergh with some men. For a moment, Verdugo thought that the skirmish was inside Zutphen and the town burghers had risen in arms against the few Spanish troops he had left behind the walls. Leicester committed the same mistake, believing that the Frisons under Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg were fighting against the Spanish inside Zutphen.|$|E
