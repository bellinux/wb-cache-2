[...] "atching Moore's noir tale <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> super-glued to your seat while getting poked in the eye," [...] Chalat-Noaker wrote. [...] "It's both {{fascinating}} and repelling." [...] Stephen Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "one of the strangest and most provocative movies this reporter has seen in eight years attending the Sundance Film Festival". At Indiewire, Eric Kohn wrote that [...] "Moore portrays Disney World as the ultimate horror show [...] and gets the point across in nearly every scene".|$|E

[...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E

Toward the end of its run, the Laemmle Fallbrook theatre displayed two signs {{on the inside of the}} ticket window in relation to the film: one that read [...] "NO REFUNDS" [...] and another citing a blurb from an early review: [...] "This film <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> stabbed in the head." [...] During one showing in the second week of its run, one of the few audience members in attendance was 5-Second Films' Michael Rousselet, who found unintentional humor in the film's poor dialogue and production values. After treating the screening as his [...] "own private Mystery Science Theater", Rousselet began encouraging friends to join him for future showings to mock the film, starting a word-of-mouth campaign that resulted in about 100 attending the film's final screening. Rousselet and his friends saw the film [...] "four times in three days," [...] and it was in these initial screenings that many of The Room traditions were born, such as the throwing of spoons and footballs during the film.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{positive}} reaction of the studio audience during recordings, a second series was commissioned before the first had started to be transmitted. However, the show was, as Mark Lawson summarised, [...] "widely disliked". [...] The BBC's publicity department compared Chalk to Fawlty Towers in the publicity materials. Critics, though, took exception to a new show being compared to such a renowned and respected programme. The cast point out that Fawlty Towers and Chalk are completely different shows, while Nicola Walker says that the comparison <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> asked to be [...] "compared to a comedy God". Writing for the BBC Guide to Comedy, Mark Lewisohn observes that the critical reception was mixed, with [...] "its detractors pointing out that Eric Slatt was a carbon copy of John Cleese's Basil Fawlty [...] its supporters praising its non-PC, off-the-wall approach and the breathlessly paced plots that delivered moments of high farce." [...] Lewisohn also comments that while some elements of the show resemble Please Sir!, [...] "Chalk more closely resembled the ill-fated Hardwicke House with its concentration on the teachers rather than the pupils, dark themes and overall depiction of the teachers as ... nuts." [...] Tom Lappin for Scotland on Sunday derided the combination of Chris Barrie's [...] Gordon Brittas and Cleese's Basil Fawlty.|$|E
500|$|While other [...] "new magazines—and {{many of the}} old—are {{dying of}} {{literary}} cirrhosis. The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction", Gold stated, Galaxy was profitable within five issues; an [...] "incredible" [...] achievement, in his words. The outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages—Gold wrote in a 1951 editorial that [...] "buying paper these days <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> mugged on a dark street"—that forced the magazine {{to find a new}} printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. That summer, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt Galaxys distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director {{and the head of the}} American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. [...] The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out what the problem was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. [...] They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell Galaxy to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. [...] In Gold's words, [...] "he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".|$|E

We are trying to liberate Judaism from the ties of an Orthodox hegemony."

He argues in favour of alternative medicine and psychic phenomena, saying that their recognition as being legitimate is impeded by a [...] "scientific priesthood" [...] with an [...] "authoritarian mentality". Citing his earlier [...] "psychic staring effect" [...] experiments and other reasons, he stated that minds are not confined to brains and remarks that [...] "liberating minds from confinement in heads <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> released from prison". He suggests that DNA is insufficient to explain inheritance, and that inheritance of form and behaviour is mediated through morphic resonance. He also promotes morphic resonance in broader fashion as an explanation for other phenomena such as memory.|$|E
2500|$|Cleansed premiered at the Royal Court's theatre {{downstairs in}} April 1998, and was {{directed}} by James Macdonald. This {{was at the time}} the most expensive production in the Royal Court's history. Kane had written the play after reading Roland Barthes' assertion that [...] "being in love <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in Auschwitz". Cleansed is set in what Kane in her stage directions described as a university but which functions more as a torture chamber or concentration camp, overseen by the sadistic Tinker. It places a young woman and her brother, a disturbed boy, a gay couple and a peepshow dancer within this world of extreme cruelty in which declarations of love are viciously tested. It pushes the limits of what can be realised in the theatre: stage directions include [...] "a sunflower pushes through the floor and grows above their heads" [...] and [...] "the rats carry Carl's feet away". The play was presented at the National Theatre in London in 2016, the first time any of Kane's work had been performed there.|$|E

2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vulture's Lindsey Weber {{felt that}} fans knew {{most of the}} details about the special due {{to the release of}} many clips prior to its premiere. She {{considered}} Minaj's appearance as one of the special's biggest changes and praised the scenes shot in slow motion as well as those showing the pair's daughter. In a positive review for Elle, Isabella Biedenharn called the special a [...] "predictable Carter propaganda" [...] with many [...] "lovey scenes" [...] occurring onstage between the pair and went on to praise Beyoncé's energetic performances. Jethro Nededog in an article for The Wrap opined that the [...] "'us against the world' imagery" [...] in the special denied rumours about the pair's divorce. He chose the performance of Lauryn Hill's [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] by Beyoncé as a show highlight. Chris Eggertsen from HitFix noted that most of the viewers watched the special because Beyoncé was featured in it. The A.V. Clubs writer Joshua Alston deemed the special a tribute to the pair's romance and felt it was [...] "handsomely shot... offering {{the next best thing to}} being there for anyone who couldn't get a line of credit approved in time to buy the exorbitant tickets", while further praising the concert itself. He went on to laud the pair's chemistry on the stage and during their joint performances. However, he finished his review in a more mixed note, writing [...] "But for anyone who's more interested in the Carters the less pristine they appear to be, On The Run <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> served a 60-pound steak after you've already filled up on sizzle."
