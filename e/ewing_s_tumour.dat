Presentation of caseWe present a unique radiographic presentation of solitary bone plasmocytoma (SBP) occurring in the Jaw. A 63 -year-old male presented with the left mandibular swelling and on the conventional radiograph we noticed a lytic lesion with a sunray periosteal reaction. Clinical diagnosis was osteosarcoma but histopathology revealed sheets of plasma cells with cartwheel appearance and expansile bony trabecula suggestive for solitary bone plasmocytoma. 5 years after complentary treatment by local radiotherapy he developed malaise, weakness and generalized bone pain and bone marrow aspiration revealed more than 90 % plasma cell in the marrow and diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma was confirmed. DISCUSSIONSBP is radiographically seen as a well-defined radiolucent expansile lytic lesion with cortical thinning and no periosteal reaction. The imaging appearance of periosteal reaction is determined by the intensity, aggressiveness, and duration of the underlying pathology. Osteosarcoma, Metastasis (especially from sigmoid colon and rectum), <b>Ewing</b> <b>s</b> sarcoma, Haemangioma, meningioma and Tuberculosis are the main differential diagnosis of Sunburst periosteal reaction.

We hypothesized that FKBP 51 <b>s</b> resulted from <b>tumour</b> interaction with immune cells, through PDL- 1 /PD- 1. To address this issue, we performed melanoma/PBMC cocultures. Furthermore, the immunohistochemistry of 76 melanoma specimens served to investigate whether FKBP 51 <b>s</b> stained <b>tumour</b> infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results showed that PBMCs expressed FKBP 51 s when cocultured with melanoma. Tumour PDL- 1 knockdown or anti-PD- 1 reduced FKBP 51 s expression in cocultured PBMCs.

40|$|Background: The {{hydrophobic}} triterpenes, oleanolic and betulinic acid {{as well as}} the hydrophilic mistletoe lectins and viscotoxins possess anticancer properties. They do all {{occur in}} combination in European mistletoe (Viscum album L.). Commercial Viscum album L. extracts are aqueous, excluding the insolub le triterpenes. We have previously shown that mistletoe lectins and triterpene acids are effective against Ewing sarcoma in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Methods: We recreated a total mistletoe effect (viscumTT) by combining an aqueous extract (viscum) and a triterpene extract (TT) solubilised with cyclodextrins and analysed the effects of viscumTT and the single extracts on TC- 71 Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro by transcriptomic and proteomic profiling. Results: Treatment with the extracts strongly impacted <b>Ewing</b> <b>s</b> arcoma cell gene and protein expression. Apoptosis- associated and stress-activated genes were upregulated, proteasomal protein abundance enhanced and ribosomal and spliceosomal proteins downregulated. The mec hanism of action of viscum, TT and viscumTT in TC- 71 and MHH-ES- 1 cells suggests the involvement of the unfolded protein response. While viscum and viscumTT extract treatment indicate response to oxidative stress and activation of stress-mediated MAPK signalling, TT extract treatment suggests the involvement of TLR signalling and autophagy.

40|$|As {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) {{has been reported to}} be a radiation response modulator, HER inhibitors are regarded to act as potential radiosensitisers. Our study examined the role of nimotuzumab and cetuximab both, the two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR, as radiosensitisers in a murine glioma model in vivo. Co-administration of both the antibodies with radiation increased the radiosensitivity of U 87 MG, resulting in a significant delay of subcutaneous (<b>s.</b> c.) <b>tumour</b> growth. Furthermore, the addition of antibodies to the radiation decreased brain tumour sizes and is inhibited by 40 – 80 % the increased tumour cell invasion provoked by radiotherapy, although promoted tumour cell apoptosis. Whereas nimotuzumab led to a reduction in the size of tumour blood vessels and proliferating cells in <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours,</b> cetuximab had no significant antiangiogenic nor antiproliferative activity. In contrast, cetuximab induced a more marked inhibition of EGFR downstream signalling compared with nimotuzumab.

Recent data have suggested that protocols combining the radiosensitizer, misonidazole (MISO), with bifunctional alkylating agents and several nitrosoureas may be useful {{for the treatment of}} human malignancies (Clement et al., 1980; La...|$|R
40|$|In these {{proceedings}} {{we explore}} {{the use of}} (non-linear) electroweak chiral Lagrangians for the description of possible beyond the Standard Model (BSM) strong dynamics in the electroweak (EW) sector. Experimentally one observes an approximate EW symmetry breaking pattern S U(2) L ×S U(2) R/S U(2) L+R. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) shows a similar chiral structure [1] and, {{in spite of the}} differences (in the <b>EW</b> theory <b>S</b> U(2) L × U(1) Y is gauged), it has served for years as a guide for this type of studies [2 – 4]. Examples of one-loop computations in the low-energy effective theory and the theory including the first vector (V) and axial-vector (A) resonances are provided, yielding, respectively, predictions for γγ → ZLZL, WL+ WL− and the oblique parameters S and T...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} histological pattern of tumour growth of hormone-responsive MCF- 7 human mammary adenocarcinoma varied in different tissues of athymic mice. Tumours in the uterus following intrauterine injection were rapidly proliferating and highly invasive. Tumours injected intracerebrally were also highly invasive. In contrast, <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumours</b> and those which arose in the lung following intrapleural injection, grew as small localized nodules without evidence of aggressive invasion of surrounding tissues. These findings indicate that selective implantation of human tumours in athymic mice can be used to develop different models of tumour growth and aggressiveness...|$|R
40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) {{is found}} at high {{concentrations}} in neural crest-derived tumours {{and has been}} implicated as a regulatory peptide in tumour growth and differentiation. Neuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas and phaeochromocytomas with significant concentrations of NPY-like immunoreactivity were investigated for different molecular forms of NPY and for significance of proNPY processing. Gel-permeation chromatography identified intact NPY (1 – 36) in all tumours, whereas proNPY (69 amino acids) was detected only in control adrenal tissue and malignant neuroblastomas. Purification of NPY-like immunoreactivity in tumour extracts and structural characterization revealed that both NPY (1 – 36) and the truncated form NPY (3 – 36) was present. The degree of processing of proNPY to NPY in tumour tissue was lower in advanced neuroblastomas with regional or metastatic spread (stage 3 and 4) (n = 6), (41 %, 12 – 100 %, median, range), compared to the less aggressive stage 1, 2 and 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumours</b> (n = 12), (93 %; 69 – 100 %), (P = 0. 012). ProNPY processing of less than 50 % was correlated with poor clinical outcome (P = 0. 004). MYCN oncogene amplification was also correlated to a low degree of proNPY processing (P = 0. 025). In summary, a low degree of proNPY processing was correlated to clinical advanced stage and poor outcome in neuroblastomas. ProNPY/NPY processing generated molecular forms of NPY with known differences in NPY-receptor selectivity, implicating a potential for in vivo modulation of NPY-like effects in tumour tissue. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to identify the}} factors predictive of radiation pneumoni-tis (RP) in 69 {{non-small cell lung cancer}} patients treated with thoracic radiation therapy only by 3 Gy fractions. Methods: A total of 69 patients who received only RT in daily 3 Gy were included in this study. Grade 3 RP was defined as an RP event. The cumulative incidence of RP was estimated and the correlations of the development of RP with the potential predictors were determined. Results: The cumulative incidence of events was 17. 1 % at 12 months. By univariate analy-sis, all clinical factors [age, performance status, weight loss, pre-RT forced expiratory volume in 1 <b>s,</b> <b>tumour</b> location, stage, RT dose and clinical target volume] were not associated with the risk of Grade 3 RP; however, all dosimetric factors [V 5 – 50 and mean lung dose (MLD) ] closely correlated with the development of RP. The receiver-operative characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed that MLD was the best predictors of Grade 3 RP (area under curve ROC 0. 937). By multivariate analysis, MLD was the only significant factor to be predictive of RP risk: the probability of Grade 3 RP was 3. 7 % when MLD 16. 1 Gy and 78. 4 % when MLD. 16. 1 Gy. Conclusions: Dosimetric parameters were valuable in predicting the development of RP. Key words: radiation pneumonitis – radiation therapy – hypofractionated treatment – lung cance...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} s. c. Walker 256 {{carcinoma}} {{was found to}} be independent of secondary growths induced by i. v. injection. Tumour cells injected i. v. lodged mainly in the lungs, with small clusters of cells in the lymph nodes. The rate of cellular proliferation of these secondary growths of Walker carcinoma was significantly higher than that observed in the <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumour.</b> In addition, host lung tissue was found to inhibit the development of metastases, and it is postulated that the host tissue may produce a diffusible inhibitor and that differences in the effectiveness of these humoral factors may account, in part, for locational differences in tumour growth patterns...|$|R
