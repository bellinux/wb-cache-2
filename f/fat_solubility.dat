30|$|Lipases (triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, EC 3.1. 1.3) are enzymes which {{belong to}} class hydrolases. Their natural {{function}} is to catalyze hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (fats) in vivo and form glycerol and fatty acids. <b>Fats</b> have poor <b>solubility</b> in aqueous systems and create an interface with water. Therefore, these enzymes have been evolved to work optimally in an organic-aqueous interface through a phenomenon called interfacial activation (Sarda and Desnuelle 1958; Anthonsen et al. 1995; Verger 1997). Another advantage of using lipases from microbial sources, including bacteria, fungi and yeast, {{is that they do}} not need any co-enzymes for their activity, and thus have a simple mechanism of action which can be easily understood and controlled.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{carbonation}} (1000 and 2000 ppm) on whole milk concentrate {{and the resultant}} spray dried whole milk powder (WMP) was investigated in this research. Carbonation was found to produce WMP with reduced surface <b>fat</b> content, dispersibility, <b>solubility</b> and true density, and increased occluded air content. During accelerated storage at 37 Â°C for 18 weeks, the surface coverage of fat on powder particles increased from 51, 29 and 8 to 94, 88 and 69 % (WMP without treatment and treated with 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm CO respectively) due to the release and spreading of encapsulated fat. In addition {{to the release of}} fat onto the surface, microscopy observations showed the migration of free fat into the powder particle vacuoles. Meanwhile, dispersibility and solubility of the powders decreased during storage for 18 weeks. These results suggest that carbonation may result in powders with better shelf life due to the reduced surface fat content. Improvements in functional properties was not observed, possibly due to the fine size of the powders...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the variability in broiler performance, apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and ileal digestible energy (IDE) between five different maize samples fed with and without xylanase at 16, 000 U/kg. Various in vitro characterisations were conducted to determine if any could predict performance or AME. Samples of the maize were harvested in five diverse regions and fed individually in a mash diet as follows (g/kg) : test maize 608. 3; soya bean meal (SBM) 324. 1; poultry fat 25. 2; salt 4. 6; met 2. 6; lys 1. 6; thr 0. 5; limestone 9. 7, dical 18. 4; vit/min 5. 0; CP 210 and ME (kcal/kg) 3, 085. The diets were fed to 720 broilers with 6 replicates, each containing 12 birds per treatment, from 0 to 18 d of age. Maize samples were analysed for starch, protein, crude fibre, <b>fat,</b> protein <b>solubility</b> index (PSI) and vitreousness using near infra red reflectance spectroscopy (NIR). They were also assayed using an in vitro starch digestibility method. The results showed that there was no effect of harvest region on the feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG) or feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the broilers over the 18 d period (p = 0. 959, 0. 926, 0. 819 respectively). There was an improvement in all parameters with the addition of xylanase (FI p = 0. 011; BWG and FCR p< 0. 001). There was a significant positive effect of xylanase on IDE, AME, IDE Intake (IDEI) and AME intake (AMEI) (p< 0. 0001 in all cases). Although there was no significant effect of maize source, there was a strong trend towards variability in IDE (p = 0. 066) and AME (p = 0. 058). There were no significant correlations (p< 0. 05) between any proximate or physiochemical values and any performance or AME values. This may suggest that none of those selected were suitable predictors for performance or AME. The broilers performed well according to the breed guidelines, with slightly increased FI, increased BWG and similar FCR prior to the addition of xylanase. When FCR and BWG were analysed with FI as a covariate, xylanase addition remained significant suggesting that the improvement in BWG and FCR was driven by an increase in digestibility and nutrient availability...|$|R
40|$|Two {{defatted}} jojoba seed meals were prepared; one using whole seeds (JM), and {{the other}} from which seed coats were removed prior to extraction of the oil (DJM). The protein content of both meals was about 24 %. The proteins from JM and DJM were extracted according to their solubility in water, dilute saline, alcohol, and alkali solutions. These extractions produced the albumin, globulin, prolamine and glutelin protein concentrates. The major concentration of proteins in jojoba were the albumin (65 %) and globulin (21 %) fractions. The amino acid compositions of both JM and DJM {{were found to be}} very similar. Methionine was the limiting amino acid in jojoba seed proteins. The protein composition was determined, and the molecular weight was estimated through chromatographic analysis using gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sephadex. At least 5 separate protein fractions in each of the albumin and globulin concentrates and 8 separate protein fractions in each of the prolamine and glutelin concentrates were found. The molecular weights of jojoba protein concentrates varied from 19, 000 to 150, 000 for albumins, from 18, 000 to 128, 800 for globulins, from 11, 700 to 141, 200 for prolamines, and from 29, 500 to 150, 000 for glutelins. All protein concentrates showed very good <b>fat</b> absorption and <b>solubility</b> at values of pH below 3. 0 and above 4. 0. Albumins and globulins showed very good foamability and emulsion properties. The prolamine and glutelin concentrates showed very poor foamability and emulsion properties.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1800 s {{the range of}} {{synthesized}} chemicals has increased dramatically to include pesticides, plastics, hydrocarbon fuels, soaps, detergents and other useful substances. The effects in the environment are result of a sequence of processes that depend on the properties of individual chemical. DDT {{has been the focus}} of a large amount of early research due to its effects on the endocrine system leading to egg shell thinning and reduced breeding in birds. DDT is a member of chlorohydrocarbons, a family of chemically related insecticides. Chlorohydrocarbons are highly toxic to aquatic organisms, persistent, soluble in fat and have very low solubility in water. They move from water to animals with a large increase in concentration by a process described as bioaccumulation. This group, banned from use in many countries, includes industrial chemicals such as PCBs and combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans. In terms of used quantities herbicides are of major importance but their properties differ significantly from chlorohydrocarbons. Herbicides are relatively water soluble but less soluble in fat and less persistent. Thus they don't bioaccumulate and are less toxic having a much lower impact in the environment. Organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethrins and pyrethroids also have, in general, low <b>solubility</b> in <b>fat,</b> relatively high <b>solubility</b> in water but low persistence and are not bioaccumulative. Members of this group can be highly toxic to biota including mammals and aquatic organisms but overall their environmental effects are usually low. Soaps and detergents, containing surfactants, have relatively low toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Although discharged to environment in large quantities their effects are generally low. Plastics differ from other contaminants since these substances enter environment as solid wastes with little toxicity but have other adverse environmental effects. The management of these effects relates to their degradation and removal from the system. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|DDT {{was brought}} to public {{attention}} by Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. One side-effect of DDT {{is to reduce the}} thickness of shells on the eggs of predatory birds. The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, reducing bird populations. This occurs with DDT and related compounds due to the process of bioaccumulation, wherein the chemical, due to its stability and <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> accumulates in organisms' fatty tissues. Also, DDT may biomagnify, which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the food chain. The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the peregrine falcon, to recover in recent years. A number of organochlorine pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide. Globally they are controlled via the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. These include: aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex and toxaphene.|$|E

50|$|One PBT {{of concern}} {{includes}} DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an organochlorine that was widely {{used as an}} insecticide during World War II to protect soldiers from malaria carried by mosquitoes. Due to the low cost and low toxicity to mammals, {{the widespread use of}} DDT for agricultural and commercial motives started around 1940. However, the overuse of DDT lead to insect tolerance to the chemical. It was also discovered that DDT had a high toxicity to fish. DDT was banned in the US by 1973 because of building evidence that DDTâs stable structure, high <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> and low rate of metabolism, caused it to bioaccumulate in animals. While DDT is banned in the US, other countries such as China and Turkey still produce and use it quite regularly through Dicofol, an insecticide that has DDT as an impurity. This continued use {{in other parts of the}} world is still a global problem due to the mobility and persistence of DDT.|$|E

Steers (n = 252) from 15 Brahman sires and 1 Nellore sire and born from Hereford (n = 44) or Angus (n = 208) cows were evaluated over five years for difference in tenderness. Sixty purebred Angus steers were included {{in the last three years}}. The cattle were commercially slaughtered and quality and yield grade characteristics were obtained. Warner-Bratzler shear force values (kg) were obtained after 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of aging at 4 ?C. Sarcomere length ([]m), 24 h calpastatin activity (activity/g), fat (%), moisture (%), total collagen (mg/g), and collagen solubility (%) also were determined. Sire influenced (P <. 05) adjusted preliminary yield grade (PYG), hot carcass weight, ribeye area, kidney, pelvic, and heart (KPH) fat, yield grade, lean maturity, overall maturity, marbling, and quality grade. Sire affected (P <. 05) shear force values for aging periods 1, 7, and 21 d postmortem aging. Sire influenced (P <. 05) percentage <b>fat</b> and collagen <b>solubility,</b> but sire did not affect sarcomere length, calpastatin activity, percent moisture, or amount of total collagen. Purebred Angus steers were included in the last three years of this study. The F? steers were less tender at 1 d and 7 d postmortem than Angus steers. Angus steers reached their maximum tenderness after 7 d postmortem. However, F? steers showed a faster rate of aging and were not different in tenderness after 14 d postmortem aging than meat from Angus steers. Angus and F? steers also were compared using only the data from the last three years. Angus steers had younger lean maturity, higher adjusted PYG, higher skeletal maturity, higher marbling scores, and high quality grades than (P <. 05) than F? steers. Sarcomere length, percent moisture, and percent fat differed between breeds, however calpastatin activity did not. As in the overall analysis, shear force values for Angus steers showed an improvement after 7 d postmortem aging and did not differ with longer aging period.

40|$|Resumen del pÃ³ster presentado al 28 th International Symposium on Chromatography celebrado en Valencia (EspaÃ±a) del 12 al 16 de septiembre de 2010. Chitosans are {{cationic}} biopolymers {{composed of}} Ã (1 - 4) linked residues of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine {{which have been}} described to have broad applications in medicine, cosmetics, foods and agriculture. However, their use is limited since they are only soluble in acidic medium (pH < 6. 5). The introduction of hydrophilic residues chemically bound to reactive amino groups of chitosan {{has been shown to}} improve the solubility as well as functional properties of the polymer and many studies have been conducted in this sense. Due to their high hydrophilicity and specificity, carbohydrates have been used for chitosan modifications. Glycosylation of chitosan with lactobionic acid (4 -O-Ã-D-galactopyranosyl-D-gluconic acid, LA) through amide formation give rise to branched derivatives with modified characteristics. Different functional properties have been reported for LA such as pH-reducing and strong mineral-complexing effect which makes it suitable for diverse applications in food industry. Moreover, it has been described to be resistant to digestive enzymes being fermented by the intestinal flora, which makes it a potential prebiotic compound. The objective of this work was to synthesize different low molecular weight chitosan derivatives introducing LA chains in order to study their influence in the functional properties of the final products. LA was covalently coupled to low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as cross linker agents. For the determination of the molecular weight of chitosans and their derivatives, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used. Two TSKGel series columns (G 2500 PWXL Ã G 5000 PWXL) were combined and coupled to a RID- 10 A Shimadzu refractive index (RI) detector. Analyses were performed at 25 ÂºC in a solution of 0. 5 M AcOH- 0. 2 M AcONa as mobile phase with a flow rate of 0. 8 mL/min. Commercial pullulan samples of different molecular weights were used for the calibration curve. The degree of acetylation was determined by FT-IR and potentiometric titration. Functional properties such as <b>solubility,</b> <b>fat</b> binding capacity (FBC) and water binding capacity (WBC) of the samples were also evaluated. Changes in molecular weight and degree of acetylation of the samples were observed after the reaction, suggesting the development of new derivatives. Moreover, when comparing FTIR spectra of these compounds with those of native chitosan and LA, differences were observed, confirming the successfully introduction of LA into chitosan chains. These derivatives presented different degrees of substitution (11 - 24 %). Functional properties of glycosylated LMWC improved with respect to those of native chitosan.

50|$|Methadone has a slow {{metabolism}} and very high <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> making it longer lasting than morphine-based drugs. Methadone has a typical elimination half-life of 15 to 60 hours {{with a mean}} of around 22. However, metabolism rates vary greatly between individuals, up to a factor of 100, ranging from as few as 4 hours to as many as 130 hours, or even 190 hours. This variability is apparently due to genetic variability in the production of the associated cytochrome enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2D6. Many substances can also induce, inhibit or compete with these enzymes further affecting (sometimes dangerously) methadone half-life. A longer half-life frequently allows for administration only once a day in Opioid detoxification and maintenance programs. Patients who metabolize methadone rapidly, on the other hand, may require twice daily dosing to obtain sufficient symptom alleviation while avoiding excessive peaks and troughs in their blood concentrations and associated effects. This can also allow lower total doses in some such patients. The analgesic activity is shorter than the pharmacological half-life; dosing for pain control usually requires multiple doses per day.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{spermicidal}} activities against human spermatozoa of a {{range of}} non-ionic, anionic and cationic surface-active agents have been determined with the method of Baker, Ransom & Tynen (1937). Although it has been concluded that surface-tension-lowering properties do not directly influence spermicidal power, the surface-tension/concentration curves of a number of the compounds were studied. Solubilities in water, hexane, and ethyl oleate were also determined in an attempt to find out whether there was any relationship between spermicidal action and solubilities in these solvents. The results obtained on the compounds studied showed broadly that appreciable oil solubility and good surface-tension-lowering properties were desirable for spermicidal activity in non-ionic and anionic surface-active agents.

ABSTRACT: Human milk is the most natural and superior food for infants, providing a range of benefits for growth, immunity and development a significant decreasing risk for several acute and chronic diseases. However, breast milk is not pure. Pollutants have been intentionally or inadvertently produced and introduced into the environment. Due to long half-lives and <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> chemicals tend to bio accumulate in long-lived species {{at the top of}} the food-chain, including in human milk. Through breastfeeding, a mother may transfer potentially toxic chemicals to the suckling infant, exercising systemic and harmful effects on the health of children. Although scientific evidence indicates that the advantages of breast-feeding outweigh any risks from contaminants, it is important to identify communities with major sources of human exposure, limit the presence of pollutants in the food supply and modify their critical short-and long-term action in children. Furthermore, by controlling the use of these toxic products safe breastfeeding could be ensured and encouraged.

A dose of 2 g/day as the ester reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10 %,and little difference is observed between Delta(5) -sterols and 5 alpha-reduced sterols (stanols). Phytosterolscan also be dispersed in water after emulsification with lecithin and reduce cholesterol absorption whenadded to nonfat foods. In contrast to these supplementation studies, much less {{is known about the}} effect oflow phytosterol levels in the natural diet. However, reduction of cholesterol absorption can be measured at adose of only 150 mg during otherwise sterol-free test meals, suggesting that natural food phytosterols maybe clinically important. Current literature suggests that phytosterols are safe when added to the diet, andmeasured absorption and plasma levels are very small. Increasing the aggregate amount of phytosterolsconsumed in a variety of foods may be an important way of reducing population cholesterol levels andpreventing coronary heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Although {{methidathion}} is an organophosphate insecticide, it {{is different}} from the other organophosphates in terms of toxicity. Because of its relatively high <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> the apparent volume of methidathion distribution throughout the body is very high, indicating that hemoperfusion is not effective in removing this organophosphate from the body. Redistribution of methidathion from fat to blood can also occur when plasma levels diminish. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase aging, which is the loss of an alkyl side chain that prevents reactivation by oximes, is very rapid so that the effective reactivation by oximes is thwarted. Thus, methidathionâs effect on acetylcholinesterase inhibition is long lasting, particularly with a high dose. In addition to its parasympatholytic effect and ability to induce muscle paralysis, methidathion poisoning is associated with a profound and long-lasting circulatory collapse due to sympathetic ganglion blockade. This report presents the case of a 55 -year-old man who accidentally ingested a high dose of methidathion. He later developed enteroinvasive aspergillosis infection-induced multiple bowel perforations on two separate occasions while on mechanical ventilator support, resulting in a fatal outcome. The renin-angiotensin axis activated by sympathetic ganglion blockade may have reduced the patientâs splanchnic blood flow, contributing to translocation of endotoxin. Also, the effect of excessive acetylcholine on non-neuronal acetylcholine receptors {{may have contributed to the}} development of fatal enteroinvasive aspergillosis in this patient...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cannabis is {{the most}} common illegal {{substance}} used in the world. The psychoactive nature of cannabis is primarily due to delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Some research suggests that prolonged cannabinoid use increases its half-life and <b>fat</b> <b>solubility</b> in the body, slowing gastric emptying, leading towards feelings of nausea and vomiting. We describe a case where a 32 year old male has excessive nausea and vomiting after prolonged use of daily cannabis. Case Report: A 32 year old Hispanic male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with five days history of nausea and vomiting associated with abdominal pain. The vomitus is associated with diffuse abdominal pain and is alleviated by taking hot showers. Vital signs were normal and physical exam showed some abdominal tenderness. CBC and CMP were normal, and urine toxin screen revealed positivity for THC. The patient was admitted with possible diagnoses of cannabis induced hyperemesis. He was placed on Lorazepam and he took multiple hot showers, which improved his nausea. The next day he was discharged home in stable condition. Conclusion: Our patient reported the vomiting episodes were associated with the regular usage of cannabis over 19 years. One theory on the effectiveness of hot showers states that it may correct the disequilibrium of the thermoregulatory system in the hypothalamus. Another theory suggests that the concept of peripheral vasodilation and redistribution of blood flow from the splanchnic circulation to peripheral musculature helps decrease vomiting. This research gap shows that further studying of cannabis and its effects are still needed...|$|E
40|$|ALTHOUGH {{the effects}} of {{inhalation}} of toxic fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, found in caves and wells, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide from smoke and fire, were undoubtedly known already in prehistoric times, these substances were never used voluntarily to produce an abnormal mental state of intoxication by inhalation. There is though one ancient exception: the priestesses of Apollo, the Pythia in Delphi and the Sybilla in Cumae reportedly inhaled mephitic and intoxicating vapours arising from a cavern, and {{under the influence of}} these fumes uttered their famous oracles. Lately a new substance has been added to the list of those used to produce intoxicationâgasoline. The Noxious Agent: Gasoline or benzine, as it is called in Europe, is one of the volatile narcotic substances of the hydrocarbons, to which also belong ether, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, chloral hydrate, chloroform and petroleum. It must be considered a toxic substance, since under certain conditions it can endanger the well-being of or even kill an animal organism solely through the chemical or physical-chemical interactions between the substance and the cells of the organism. Gasoline, as one of the substances which has the property of dissolving many organic materials, including fat, which is a component of many vital human tissues, can be expected to have an injurious eifect when brought in contact with the living organism. Belonging to the group of organic solvents, it is, like all organic solvents, capable of producing some degree of narcotic effect. The greater the <b>fat</b> <b>solubility</b> in comparison to the water solubility, the more potent the narcotic properties of the compound. Thus the alcohols are weak anaesthetics, the hydrocarbons and th...|$|E
40|$|San Daniele PDO ham {{characteristics}} {{in relationship to}} genetic type. Four heavy pig genetic types reared {{for the production of}} San Daniele prosciutto PDO were considered: two âreferenceâ hybrids (Italian Large White or Italian Duroc x (Italian Landrace x Italian Large White)) and two âindustrialâ genotypes (GOLAND and DANBRED). The experimental measurements (curing loss, ham compliance percentage, chemical composition and technological characteristics of Biceps femoris, fatty acid profile of subcutaneous adipose tissue of green thighs and hams, sensory properties of hams) were carried out on the hams obtained from 450 compliant raw thighs, balanced by genotype, sex (females and castrated males), and carcass fatness (U and R classes following the European grading system). The genotype influenced with different intensity all the parameters measured. The highest compliance percentages were observed on Goland (86 %) and Duroc-sired (78 %) hams, that also showed the relatively lowest curing loss (276 and 296 g/kg di raw thigh, respectively), and good technological characteristics (Proteolysis index 28. 4 and 28. 6 %; chewiness 4. 5 and 4. 3 N; free fatty acids 104 and 88 mg/kg total lipids, respectively) in comparison with Danbred hams (curing loss 311 g/kg; chewiness 4. 8 N; free fatty acids 116 mg/kg). Only three of the 15 descriptors validated to describe the sensory profile of San Daniele ham, differed between Goland and Duroc-sired ham. The last one presented slightly higher cured odour and bitter taste in lean and <b>fat</b> <b>solubility</b> than Goland ham. The differences between genetic types are not strictly related to the classic relationship between Italian traditional heavy pigs and industrial hybrids, because within each group we found high variability...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the risks posed by {{cosmetic}} products {{can also be}} larger compared with other consumer products due to the following reasons: (1) Repeated exposure increases the hazard ([1] Annex VI Part 1 1.2. 1.), which is clearly the case for cosmetic products since {{many of them are}} used daily, such as tooth paste, soap or shower gel. (2) Cosmetic products are applied intentionally directly on the body surface and lead therefore to a higher exposure compared with most other consumer products. Leave-on products such as lotions or decorative cosmetics should be differentiated from rinse-off products such as shower gels or shampoos. (3) Most consumers use several cosmetic products, not only one single product everyday, which increases the exposure. (4) Solvents in cosmetic products increase <b>fat</b> <b>solubility</b> and therefore skin penetration. (5) Combined exposure of an allergen with a detergent e.g. in washing liquids can increase the allergic reaction [19]. (5) There are further interactions of substances, e.g. musk compounds are known to inhibit cellular xenobiotic export systems [17]. (6) Cross-reaction is known e.g. for some fragrances which are contact allergens [18, 19]. (7) Many ingredients are not stable, especially in light and at warm temperatures. The metabolites can be more toxic than the original compounds. An example for this case is D-Limonene with a low allergenic potency that can be oxidized by air to strong allergens [20 â 22]. Further examples are carcinogenic nitrosamines which can be contaminants or reaction products of triethanolamin and Cocamide DEA, frequently used components in decorative eye cosmetics [23]. Cosmetics have been demonstrated to be the cause of contact allergies and many of them contain acids, bases, inorganic salts, aldehydes, and surfactants, substances which can be corrosive or irritant at concentrations < 1 % and would need to be considered with special care according to the CLP Regulation ([1] 3.2. 3.3. 4.1). (9) Cosmetic products are mainly discharged via waste water. Therefore, their toxicity to aquatic organisms is of greater relevance than for many other consumer products. (10) The products under scrutiny here correspond to the Cosmetic Regulation [6]. However, not all products in the retail shops comply with the requirements laid down there. Many products have to be withdrawn from the market because the levels of hydroquinone, methyl metacrylate, carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, di-n-butyl-phthalate, di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate or heavy metals were too high [24]. It {{is interesting to note that}} microbiological contamination is another frequent reason why cosmetic products need to be withdrawn [24].|$|E
40|$|Razine organoklorovih spojeva u naÅ¡oj se populaciji kontinuirano prate od 1975. godine Ispitivanja su poÄela analizom pesticida, a poslije su proÅ¡irena i na odreÄivanje ukupnih PCB-a. Analizirani su uzorci seruma skupljeni u stanovnika i izloÅ¾enih radnika, a i uzorci mlijeka skupljeni od majki u opÄem stanovniÅ¡tvu. Uzorkovanja su provedena u Jastrebarskom, Zagrebu, Osijeku, Labinu, Karlovcu, Sisku te na otoku Krku. U svim analiziranim uzorcima seruma i mlijeka na|eni su p,pâ-DDE (glavni metabolit DDT-ja) i PCB-i. Ostali pesticidi odnosno njihovi metaboliti (alfa-, beta- i gama-HCH, HCB, p,pâ-DDT, p,pâ-DDD) nisu na|eni u svim uzorcima. Nisu uoÄene razlike u koncentracijama s obzirom na geografski poloÅ¾aj mjesta u kojima su ispitanici Å¾ivjeli. MeÄutim uoÄeno je smanjivanje koncentracija spojeva tijekom godina. Tako je razina p,pâ-DDE-a u serumu 1975. godine bila oko 31 Î¼g/L, a danas je pribliÅ¾no deset puta niÅ¾a, dok je u humanom mlijeku 1981. / 82. godine bila oko 1900 Î¼g/kg masti, a danas je pribliÅ¾no Å¡est puta niÅ¾a. Razina PCB-a u serumu i u humanom mlijeku je tijekom dvadeset godina smanjena pribliÅ¾no tri puta, ali Äini se da tijekom posljednjih pet godina nema daljnjeg pada koncentracije. Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are organic compounds resistant to photolytic, {{chemical and biological}} degradation. They are characterised by low water solubility and high <b>fat</b> <b>solubility,</b> which results in bioconcentration in fatty tissues of living organisms. In the environment, POPs are present at low levels and can travel long distances via water and air. This is why POPs can be found all over the world, including areas where {{they have never been}} used. Organochlorine pesticides (DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, and hexachlorocyclohexane) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are two groups of POPs intensively used worldwide. Unlike these compounds, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), widely known as Â»dioxinsÂ« do not have practical application in industry. These four groups include over four hundred compounds; some of them are classified as carcinogens while others are considered potential carcinogens. Levels of organochlorine compounds in our population have been monitored since 1975. Initially, the investigation was limited to organochlorine pesticides, but later it expanded to all PCBs. Investigations included serum samples collected from general population and from exposed workers as well as human milk samples from general population of lactating women. Samples were collected in Zagreb, Osijek, Labin, Jastrebarsko, Karlovac, Sisak, and on the island of Krk. The main DDT metabolite p,pâ-DDE and PCB were found in all analysed samples, serum and milk. Other pesticides or their metabolites (_-, _- and _- HCH, HCB, p,pâ-DDT, p,pâ-DDD) were not found in all samples. No marked differences were found between samples taken from individuals living in different geographic areas, but the levels indicated a downward trend. Since 1975 serum p,pâ-DDE levels, which were then 31 Î¼g/L, have dropped about ten times. Human milk levels were 1, 900 Î¼g/kg milk fat in 1981 / 82 and now are about six times lower. For the past twenty years PCB levels in serum and milk have also dropped about three times, yet they seem to have stabilised over the past five years. As lack of equipment bars dioxin analyses in Croatia, it was performed by qualified institutions in the USA, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Dioxin levels found in human milk samples collected in Zagreb, Krk, Jastrebarsko, Labin, and Osijek in 1981 â 1997 kept between 8. 4 â 26. 7 I-TEQ ng/kg milk fat (expressed as TCDD toxic equivalents according to international toxicity factors). A comparative study organised by the World Health Organization showed a 1. 8 % annual decrease from year 1992 to 1987 in samples collected in Zagreb and Krk. By contrast, other European countries and Canada showed a 7. 2 % decrease. However, one should take into account that levels in milk samples collected in Croatia are in {{the lower half of the}} concentration range determined in samples from other European countries, Canada, and Pakistan and it would not be reasonable to expect that the Croatian samples show a similar drop in dioxin levels. Samples collected from occupationally exposed workers who worked either with organochlorine pesticides or PCB showed slightly higher levels than samples from general population, but still kept below a threshold at which acute signs of exposure are expected. The daily intake of organochlorine compounds was evaluated for breast-fed infants from levels in human milk, and for adults from the analysis of foodstuffs. The intake by the adult population in our country was below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values; nursing women showed higher levels than nonnursing women of the same age. This was not the case with breast-fed infants whose daily intake was higher than the ADI values in previous studies, but below ADI in recent studies. It may appear that the population of breast-fed infants is more exposed than adults, but one should keep in mind that the breast-feeding period is short in relation to the whole life, and that the benefites of breast-feeding prevail over the risk of intake of organochlorine compounds. To sum up, our investigations show that levels of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins in Croatia keep within the lower half of the concentration range found in developed and industrialised countries...|$|E
