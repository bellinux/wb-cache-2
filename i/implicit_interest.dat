His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose evolutionary consequences serve their own <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> (to continue the anthropomorphism) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary [...] "selfishness" [...] down to creation of a widely proliferated extended phenotype.|$|E
50|$|At {{first the}} general level of {{interest}} rates was low, and so the ban on demand deposit interest prevented only {{what would have been}} small interest payments, and there was no significant attempt at avoiding the ban. But starting in the 1950s, interest rates became higher and banks began to feel greater incentive to get around the ban. Non-pecuniary avoidance efforts included increased offering of convenience features such as large numbers of branch offices and giveaways of consumer goods to new customers. Pecuniary avoidance of the ban, known as <b>implicit</b> <b>interest,</b> included preferred loan rates (often tied explicitly to the customer's demand deposit balances) and below-cost service charges for services such as check-clearing.|$|E
5000|$|Interest graphs {{and social}} graphs are closely related, {{but they are}} not the same thing. Interest graphs are used to create people’s {{interest}} networks. Where Facebook and other social networks are organized around an individual’s friends, or social graph, interest networks are organized around an individual’s interests, their interest graph.Much as social graphs are maps of individuals’ social media connections that follow them across the web, interest graphs as maps of individuals’ interests can likewise follow them across the web. In this way an individual’s interests, as represented in an interest graph, provide a means of further personalizing the web based on intersecting the interest graphs with web content.Interest graphs or interest networks can in some cases be derived from social graphs or social networks and may maintain their context within that social network. These are specifically social interest graphs or interest-based social graphs.For an interest graph to be accurate and expressive, it needs to take into account explicitly declared interests, for example [...] "Likes" [...] on Facebook or “Interests” in a LinkedIn profile, as well as <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> inferred from user activities such as clicks, comments, tagged photos and check-ins. Social networks are often a source for this data.|$|E

In order to develop a good personalized application one needs to have accurate representation of user profiles. Most of the personalized systems generate interest profiles from user declarations or inferred from cookies or visited web pages. But to achieve a certain result that satisfies the user needs, explicit definition of the user interests is needed. In this paper we propose to obtain interest profiles from a quiz game played by the user where at each play he/she is asked 10 questions from different categories with different difficulty levels. The developed quiz game is integrated to Facebook online social network. By doing so, we {{had the chance to}} extract each user’s both explicit Facebook interest profiles and <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> profiles from quiz game answers. These profiles are used to extract different features for each user. Both <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> profile and explicit interest profile features are evaluated for clustering and interest ranking tasks separately.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of market discipline mechanisms in the banking sector {{before and after the}} 2001 financial crisis in Turkey. It employs an empirical model that incorporates the contemporaneous feedback effects between deposits growth rate and the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rate. Using 3 SLS procedure, the results show that market disciplinary forces in Turkey have been effective {{both before and after the}} 2001 financial crisis. The findings show that the effect of the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rate on deposits becomes more sensitive to bank risk fundamentals after the 2001 financial crisis. Depositors, on the other hand, do not change their behavior in the aftermath of the crisis which can be explained by an implicit “too-big-to-fail" protection at work. ...|$|E

In this paper empirical models are developed that relate <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates paid by firms to measures of their financial health (principally capital gearing) using both aggregate data and information from individual company accounts. Both aggregate and disaggregated approaches confirm a significant influence on interest rates from changes in the financial health of companies. The aggregate relationship finds support for the hypothesis that <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates depend on the initial level of indebtedness in a non-linear way.

40|$|Common {{tests for}} credit {{constraints}} are highly sensitive to econometric assumptions. Tests {{of the relationship}} between wealth and entry into entrepreneurship require strong assumptions about the distribution of unobserved ability, and the results change when the definition of entrepreneurship changes.

Using data from Nicaragua, I illustrate these problems, show how to make the productivity test more robust, and demonstrate a semiparametric method for measuring the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates faced by entrepreneurs at different wealth levels.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{factors that}} determine household reliance on interlinked informal credit contracts for {{fish in the}} Peruvian Amazon, {{and the degree to}} which <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates in these contracts are explained by transaction costs, administrative costs and lender risk. A probit model was used to determine household likelihood to borrow, using survey data collected in the region. This likelihood is found to depend on access to alternative activities to generate income, household resilience to income volatility, and demographics: age, education and mobility. High <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates (112 %) are not explained by the average costs (67 %) incurred by local lenders. Market access and household demand elasticity seem to be the main factors determining the degree to which forest peasants are exploited.

40|$|Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (Roscas) is an {{important}} informal financial institution {{in many parts of}} the world. Existing models of Roscas assume that their participants do not have access to formal financial markets and predict that the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates in bidding Roscas should be declining over their lives. Evidence from survey and field data sets from Wenzhou of Zhejiang Province in Southeastern China shows instead that Roscas are prevalent even in the presence of formal financial markets and more puzzlingly a large fraction of Rosca participants reported borrowing from the formal credit market to fulfil their Rosca obligations and saving their extra Rosca winnings to the formal credit market. Moreover, we find that the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates observed in a unique Rosca bidding data set are not monotonically declining over its life. We develop a sequential auction model of risk averse Rosca participants facing income risks to investigate the interaction between formal and informal financial institutions to provide a possible explanation of the above two phenomenon in the Chinese data. In this model Rosca provides insurance to its participants even in the presence of the formal credit markets. The intuition is simple: while the formal credit market allows individuals to smooth their intertemporal income risks by borrowing and saving, Rosca provides an additional instrument for its participants to share contemporaneous income shocks amongst them. We also show that in this model it is possible that the <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rate in equilibrium may not be declining over the life of a Rosca...|$|E

In addition, we discuss how those explicit semantics can be learnt automatically from the analysis of the content consumed by a user, determining which concepts appear to be significant for the user’s interest representation. The introduction of new preferences on the user profile should correspond to heuristics that provide a trade-off between consistency and persistence of the user’s <b>implicit</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R

Our empirical results show that consumer <b>implicit</b> <b>interest</b> rates are close to capital market rates, and considerably lower than the previous estimates obtained in the literature on consumer appliances. Furthermore, the results show that the relative pricing of gasoline and diesel cars is consistent with a monopoly model and inconsistent with competitive models of pricing.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{educational}} resources distributed in different repositories that address {{to a wide}} range of subjects and different educational goals. The proper choice of these educational resources is a challenge. Recommendation systems may help users in this task. In order to generate personalized recommendations, it is important to identify information that will help to define user profile and assist in identifying his/her interests. The constant and ever-increasing use of social networks allows the identification of different information about profile, interests, preferences, style and behavior from the spontaneous interaction. This paper presents an infrastructure able to extract users’ profile and educational context, from the Facebook social network and recommend educational resources. The proposal is supported by Information Extraction Techniques and Semantic Web technologies for extraction, enrichment and definition of user’s profile and interests. The recommendation approach is based on learning objects repositories, linked data and video repositories. It takes advantage of user’s spent time at the web. The proposal evaluation was made from the development of a prototype, three proofs of concept and a case study. The evaluation showed users’ acceptance of extracted information about their educational interests, automatically generated from social network and enriched to find <b>implicit</b> <b>interests.</b> It was also validated the possibility of people recommendation, enabling the establishment of interest network, based on a specific subject, showing good partners to study and research.|$|R
