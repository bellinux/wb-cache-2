40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). A very basic problem in {{manufacturing}} advanced composites is the occurrence of defects, such as voids, delamination, resin rich areas, distorted fibers and foreign material inclusions. Of these defects, voids are the unavoidable defects mostly coming {{from a variety of}} reasons, including resin type, poor vacuum source, air entrapment, leakage of vacuum bag and by-products formed during the curing cycle of laminates. These voids seriously affect the mechanical properties of composite panels, and cause severe damages during the service. In the present study, various destructive testing techniques, such as visual, burn-out or ignition loss of cured composites, image analysis and matrix digestion or acid digestive were used on advanced composite panels at various porosity levels (e. g., 0 - 2 %, 3 - 6 % and greater than 7 %), and the obtained results were compared each other. Also, testing parameters were optimized using the standard samples to achieve maximum possible error free data of voids, fiber volume, <b>fiber</b> <b>wash,</b> inter laminar and trans laminar cracks, miss-oriented fibers, lay-up orders and latent defects. Optimization of parameters was performed using the design of experiments. We determined that the test results were significantly changed based on the test techniques, composite samples, as well as testing time, operator skill, cost of experimentation, initial equipment cost, pre and post treatments and lack of standardized testing patterns...|$|E
40|$|Much {{attention}} is payed to the tasks for ensuring {{domestic and international}} aircraft safety and regularity, which are multifaceted and complex. One {{of them is the}} system of ensuring the quality of aviation fuel for refueling aircraft at airports. A significant influence of the quality, chemical composition and fuel range on the reliability and lifetime of components and parts of the aircraft fuel system was studied in the process of development and experience accumulation of aircraft operating, processes of aviation fuel production, as well as during storage, quality control, transportation, refueling preparation and aircraft refueling. Currently, work is being done to study the influence of fuel quality on the units of the technological scheme of fuel-filling complexes, which provide the required cleanliness of the fuel according to the regulations. The article describes the trend level of aviation fuel cleanliness at the stages from receipt to issuance to the refueling station. The evaluation of compliance with existing regulations on the level of jet fuel cleanliness and the efficiency of fuel cleaning facilities is carried out. It is stated that one of the problems of insufficient level of aviation fuel cleaning quality is a violation of the acceptable contamination level of the fuel before the filter. It was found that the disadvantage of the used filter paper is the <b>fiber</b> <b>wash</b> out process. According to this research it was found that while cleaning fuel from mechanical admixtures it is necessary {{to take into account the}} technical condition of the filtering element, and proposal was developed for fuel-filling systems to ensure aviation fuel cleanliness in compliance with regulations...|$|E
