40|$|Thank you for {{letter of}} 20 th December {{requesting}} SACN’s view on: · {{the introduction of}} gluten before 6 months of age to infants without {{a family history of}} atopy or <b>gluten</b> <b>enteropathy,</b> · the consumption of oat and oat ingredients before 6 months of age. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition’s (SACN) Subgroup on Maternal and Child Nutrition (SMCN) considered these issues at their first meeting on the 22 nd January 2003. The conclusions reached by the Subgroup were also endorsed by SACN at its meeting on 12 / 02 / 03 are set out below. 1. Should gluten be given to infants before 6 months if they have no family history of atopy or <b>gluten</b> <b>enteropathy?</b> As you know, SACN originally considered the introduction of gluten on 27 th March 2002 and agreed that it would be prudent to continue with the COMA recommendation on gluten in infant foods, as outlined in its 1994 report Weaning and the Weaning Diet: “Where there is a family history of atopy or <b>gluten</b> <b>enteropathy,</b> mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed for six months or longer.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was used}} to detect class-specific antibodies to wheat protein antigens. Antibodies which we detected by this technique reacted indistinguishably with antigens prepared from crude gluten, crude gliadin, alpha-gliadin, Frazer fraction III, and subtraction B and B 3 of Frazer fraction III. No sera reacted with a human serum albumin control antigen. The prevalence of IgG antibodies to wheat protein antigens was significantly greater in patients with <b>gluten</b> sensitive <b>enteropathy,</b> 12 of 17, (p =. 00011) and in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 5 of 14, (p =. 046) than in normal control subjects.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} lectin histochemistry in {{formalin}} fixed, paraffin embedded normal jejunal and subtotal villous atrophy specimens from patients with <b>gluten</b> sensitive <b>enteropathy</b> were compared. There {{was no significant}} difference in the binding pattern of five lectins (Arachis hypogaea, Canavalia ensiformis, Lens culinaris, Phaseolus vulgaris and Triticum vulgaris) between normal and abnormal specimens. There were significant changes in the binding pattern of three lectins (Dolichos biflorus, Ulex europaeus, Ricinus communis), with special reference to goblet cells staining. These changes were present in all the specimens studied, regardless of the clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis or coeliac disease. Dolichos biflorus reactive goblet cells were significantly decreased (p less than 0. 001) in abnormal tissue and confined to the luminal edge of the mucosa. Strong reactivity of goblet cells in abnormal tissue was recorded with Ricinus communis and Ulex europaeus, lectins that bind to few or no goblet cells in normal tissue.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{indicate an}} abnormal binding of gluten or gliadin to lymphocytes or intestinal mucosa cells in <b>gluten</b> sensitive <b>enteropathy.</b> Since dermatitis herpetiformis is closely associated to <b>gluten</b> sensitive <b>enteropathy,</b> similar receptors could also {{exist in the}} skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. To prove this hypothesis, skin of normal volunteers and uninvolved skin of 3 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was investigated {{for the presence of}} gliadin and gliadin binding sites. In vivo bound gliadin was not found by direct immunofluorescence using 3 different rabbit antigliadin antisera. In order to test skin for gliadin binding sites, normal sera and autologous dermatitis herpetiformis sera containing 25 mg% gliadin and tritium labeled gliadin, respectively, were used for incubation of normal and dermatitis herpetiformis skin cryocut sections and of normal and dermatitis herpetiformis skin specimens, grown under organ culture conditions. As checked by direct immunofluorescence and autoradiography, there was no specific in vitro binding of gliadin, indicating that gliadin does not fix to normal human or dermatitis herpetiformis skin. Thus, the role of gliadin in the fixation in vivo, of antibodies or immune complexes to skin in dermatitis herpetiformis, remains obscure...|$|R

In seven patients with adult steatorrhoea all three measurements were abnormal suggesting basilar impression, while basilar impression was probable in only one patient who had gastric surgery. The trend towards abnormal measurements was significant in the steatorrhoea patients but not in those who had gastric surgery. Basilar impression also was present in patients who did not have rickets or present evidence of osteomalacia. It was argued that this study could support a hypothesis that some cases of primary basilar impression of the skull are secondary to bone softening associated with malabsorption in early life, the evidence of which may have disappeared in adult life...|$|E
40|$|Circulating IgA-antigliadin {{antibodies}} {{were detected}} with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{in four of}} 121 patients (3 %) who had IgA mesangial nephropathy and 14 of 17 children (82 %) who had untreated coeliac disease. No positive cases {{were present in the}} 54 healthy subjects of the control group. Three patients who had IgA nephropathy and IgA-antigliadin antibodies underwent jejunal biopsy, and two showed mucosal atrophy. In these two patients urinary abnormalities, together with the IgA-antigliadin antibodies, disappeared completely after three months and five months, respectively, of following a gluten free diet. Circulating IgA immune complexes were found in most patients who had coeliac disease and Berger's disease associated with IgA-antigliadin antibodies, suggesting overactivity of the B cells producing IgA in both conditions. By contrast, a circulating IgA rheumatoid factor was detectable in three of the four patients who had IgA nephropathy and asymptomatic coeliac disease but was always absent in children who had coeliac disease but did not show signs of renal disease.

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare and}} {{contrast}} the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of IgA antibodies to guinea pig tissue transglutaminase (ELISA), endomysium, and reticulin (immunofluorescence), and gliadin (ELISA), and IgG antibodies to gliadin and tissue transglutaminase. METHODS: Sera from 27 newly diagnosed patients with coeliac disease, 65 biopsied gastrointestinal disease controls, and 50 consecutive blood donors were tested. All cases were adults. RESULTS: IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase showed a sensitivity of 85 % (23 / 27 coeliac disease cases seropositive), specificity 97 % (2 / 65 controls and one blood donor showing low titre positivity), and a positive predictive value of 92 %. High titre anti-tissue transglutaminase was only seen in coeliac disease. Disease controls with mucosal damage unrelated to <b>gluten</b> <b>enteropathy</b> were IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase negative. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for IgA anti-endomysial antibody (monkey oesophagus) were 100 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively, and for IgA anti-gliadin, 93 %, 95 %, and 89 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue transglutaminase is a major autoantigen in coeliac disease. IgA (but not IgG) anti-tissue transglutaminase, especially when in high titre, is closely associated with coeliac disease, but low titres may not be disease specific. In this small pilot study, the established IgA anti-endomysial assay was the superior test...|$|E

The medical records of 81 children who had elevated anti-tTG titer and had duodenal biopsies available were retrospectively reviewed. Result. Assessing the association of anti-tTG titer with duodenal histopathological changes, 94 % of those with high anti-tTG titer (≥ 180 [*]U/mL) had histological evidence of celiac disease. There was statistically significant positive association between high anti-tTG titer and Marsh grading as 82 % of patients with Marsh III had high anti-tTG titer (Chi 2 18. 5; P value 0. 00; Odds Ratio 8. 5). The fraction of patients with Marsh III who were correctly identified as positive by anti-tTG titer ≥ 180 [*]U/mL was high (sensitivity = 81. 6).

The strong humoral and cytotoxic cellular response of IgA to glutamine-forming gliadin occurs and the gliadin molecule is toxic. It is important to detect antigliadin antibody, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and/or anti-endomicin antibody in the celiac epithelium. Levels of these antibodies decline with a strict gluten-free diet or are expected to disappear completely. Glyadines in wheat varieties; sulfur-rich (alpha, beta, gamma) and sulfur-poor (omega) as they fall into two groups.

At four months, permeability in the normal diet group was greater than in controls, although comparable with that in the gluten free diet group. Permeability in the normal diet group increased further in conjunction with the development of partial villus atrophy and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and by 12 months permeability was significantly greater than in their gluten free diet litter mates and the control dogs.
