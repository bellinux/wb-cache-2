5|$|The CS spray used {{by police}} forces {{is in the}} form of a {{hand-held}} aerosol canister containing a 5% solution of CS dissolved in methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone and propelled by pressurized nitrogen. The CS spray used by UK police is generally more concentrated than that used by American police forces (5% vs 1%). The liquid stream is directed where the user points the canister, being accurate up to 4 metres. They are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained.|$|E
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{liquid-liquid}} extraction process which uses methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone as the extractant. The extraction is by a solvation mechanism. This process has {{the disadvantage of}} requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process has been replaced by the PUREX process.|$|E

500|$|Commercial {{zirconium}} metal typically contains 1–3% of hafnium, {{which is usually}} not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. [...] Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. [...] Several separation schemes are in use. [...] The liquid-liquid extraction of the thiocyanate-oxide derivatives exploits {{the fact that the}} hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone than in water. [...] This method is used mainly in United States.|$|E
500|$|These {{equations}} are simplified: it {{is suspected}} that bisulfate (HSO4−) and chloride compete as ligands for the Nb(V) and Ta(V) ions, when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used, respectively. [...] The tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then {{removed from the}} aqueous solution by liquid-liquid extraction into organic solvents, such as cyclohexanone, octanol, and methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone. This simple procedure allows the removal of most metal-containing impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium), which remain in the aqueous phase {{in the form of}} their fluorides and other complexes.|$|E
2500|$|An evaluative study {{carried out}} in 2001 by the British Home Office {{investigated}} the potential for Tasers to ignite CS spray. Seven trials were conducted, in which CS gas containing methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone (a solvent in all CS sprays used by the United Kingdom police) was sprayed over mannequins wearing street clothing. The Tasers were then fired at the mannequins. In two of the seven trials, [...] "the flames produced were severe and engulfed {{the top half of}} the mannequin, including the head". This poses a particular problem for law enforcement, as some police departments approve the use of CS before the use of a Taser.|$|E
