For all formulations, proofing rate of dough after freezing, frozen storage time and thawing, decreased in comparison to non-frozen dough, indicating that the freezing process itself was more detrimental to the proofing rate than storage time. For all formulations, the mean value of proofing rate was 2. 97 +/- 0. 24 cm(3) min(- 1) per 100 g of non-frozen dough and 2. 22 +/- 0. 12 cm(3) min(- 1) per 100 g of frozen dough.

The results show that the λh equation is in better agreement with the experimental data than the Apelblat equation. The relative root mean square deviations (σ) of the λh equation are in the range from 0. 004 to 0. 45 %. The dissolution enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs energies of telmisartan in these solvents were estimated by the Van’t Hoff equation and the Gibbs equation. The melting point and the <b>fusion</b> <b>enthalpy</b> of telmisartan were determined by differential scanning calorimetry...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} five chapters. The {{first three}} chapters are allocated to linear chain extension via associative termini. Chapter 4 describes {{the effect of}} soft segment structure on crystalline domains in block copolymers. Chapter 5 presents the synthesis and characterization of amine-terminated PEEK 2 ̆ 7 s. ^ Oligomers described in Chapter 2 comprise conformationally-flexible mid-blocks of poly(butadiene) or poly(ethylene-co- 1 -butene) capped with bis-aromatic esters which carry benzyl ester or carboxylic acid termini. Hydrogen-bonded chain termini resemble rigid rod-like hard segments. These hydrogen bond-linked hard segments are able to microphase separate and crystallize, locking the hydrogen bonds within the crystal lattice and preventing hydrogen bond dissociation. Dissociation is not possible below the melting temperature of the crystalline domains. Non hydrogen bonding ester-terminated oligomers are used as controls to highlight the effects of hydrogen bonding. Two important structural variable effects on oligomer mechanical properties are examined. These are: {{the use of an}} hydrocarbon soft segment to increase the degree of microphase separation and the effect of soft segment topology to promote network formation. Oligomers were studied by DSC, POM, and rheology. Rheological data demonstrated that chain end aggregation increased the moduli of the carboxylic acid terminated oligomers as compared to non-associative benzyl blocked oligomers. Soft segment topology {{played an important role in}} oligomer properties. ^ Chapter 3 presents a new approach to improving the mechanical properties of the carboxylic acid-terminated oligoethylene-co- 1 -butenes. One ester linkage at each terminus of the oligomers described in Chapter 2 was replaced with an amide linkage. DSC data suggested that amide-containing oligomers might have more stable crystalline domains based on the <b>fusion</b> <b>enthalpies.</b> ^ In chapter 4, we tested a hypothesis about how soft segment substituents proximate to hard segments affect microphase separation and crystallization behavior of segmented block copolymers. We synthesized copolymers with aryl ester hard segments and Reverse Pluronic soft segments. DSC and POM data were suggestive that the substituents proximate to the hard segment dramatically affected polymer thermal properties. ^ The last chapter, chapter 5, describes our effort to simplify the large scale synthesis of amine-terminated t-butylhydroquinone based PEEK 2 ̆ 7 s. High solubility of the oligomers in common organic solvents made it possible to characterize them by VPO and GPC in addition to elemental analysis. GPC analysis demonstrated that oligomers had a broad molecular weight distribution in all cases. Amine-termination step showed no dramatic molecular weight changes by GPC analysis. We could not force extensive Schiff base formation even under forcing conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{achieved in}} the reaction in adiabatic conditions, when no heat is lost to the environment, can be estimated using the Hess's law - by calculating the energy produced by the reaction itself (subtracting the enthalpy of the reactants from the enthalpy of the products) and subtracting the energy consumed to heating the products (from their specific heat, when the materials only change their temperature, and their <b>enthalpy</b> of <b>fusion</b> and eventually <b>enthalpy</b> of vaporization, when the materials melt or boil). In real conditions, the reaction loses heat to the environment, the achieved temperature is therefore somewhat lower. The heat transfer rate is finite, so the faster the reaction is, the closer to adiabatic condition it runs and the higher is the achieved temperature.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether the thermo-modeling process suits the thermal {{properties of the}} material constituting mouthformed mouthguards (MGs). Five mouth-formed MGs were compared: four commercially available MGs (SDITM, Gel NanoTM, Opro Shield GoldTM, and Kipsta R 300 TM) and one prototype. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to determine}} melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) temperatures and specifi <b>fusion</b> and crystallization <b>enthalpies</b> (∆Hf and ∆Hc (J/g)). MGs were modeled with recording of vestibular flnge and occlusal cushion temperatures (Toccl). Tm ranged from 45. 3 °C to 53. 0 °C and Tc ranged from 40. 9 °C to 48. 2 °C. Specifi heat of fusion ranged from 40. 2 J/g to 62. 0 J/g. Toccl was higher than Tm for all MGs except Kipsta R 300 TM. Guidelines provided by manufacturers may not be adapted to thermal properties of the MG material. To ensure proper thermomodeling, heating and biting durations should be adjusted...|$|R
