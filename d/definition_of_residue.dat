Based on statistics of observed interatomic distances, they generally encode pairwise contact information.

A fractionation protocol was applied to quantify the 14 C- 2, 4 -D thatwas incorporated into the biomass among biomolecular-like fractions. Successive fractionation of microbial biomass was implemented to break up and quantify the methanol/dichloromethane fraction (corresponding to the 14 C-lipid-like fraction), the trichloroacetic acid fraction (or hydrolysed 14 C-polysaccharide-like fraction) and the acid hydrolysable fraction (or the hydrolysed 14 C-protein-like fraction). Relevant differences in the 2, 4 -D degradation and biomass radioactivity distribution among the three microorganisms were found. The 14 C-protein-like fraction was the most consistent biomass fraction for reflecting the pesticide use capacity of the microorganisms under liquid and soil conditions. 2, 4 -D and its metabolite 4 - chlorophenol were detected in methanol/dichloromethane and trichloroacetic acid fractions of the biomass of microorganisms exhibiting a low capacity to mineralize 2, 4 -D, thus proving that the microbial participation in the formation <b>of</b> bound <b>residues</b> while conserving the initial pesticide structure under natural soil conditions may be intimately associatedwith the lipid- and polysaccharide-like constituents.

Finally, we critically compare disorder prediction methods on our transmembrane protein set.

40|$|Abstract Background In the {{research}} on protein functional sites, researchers often need to identify binding-site residues on a protein. A commonly used strategy {{is to find a}} complex structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) that consists of the protein of interest and its interacting partner(s) and calculate binding-site residues based on the complex structure. However, since a protein may participate in multiple interactions, the binding-site residues calculated based on one complex structure usually do not reveal all binding sites on a protein. Thus, this requires researchers to find all PDB complexes that contain the protein of interest and combine the binding-site information gleaned from them. This process is very time-consuming. Especially, combing binding-site information obtained from different PDB structures requires tedious work to align protein sequences. The process becomes overwhelmingly difficult when researchers have a large set of proteins to analyze, which is usually the case in practice. Results In this study, we have developed a tool for calculating binding-site residues on proteins, TCBRP [URL]. For an input protein, TCBRP can quickly find all binding-site residues on the protein by automatically combining the information obtained from all PDB structures that consist of the protein of interest. Additionally, TCBRP presents the binding-site residues in different categories according to the interaction type. TCBRP also allows researchers to set the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> binding-site <b>residues.</b> Conclusion The developed tool is very useful for {{the research}} on protein binding site analysis and prediction. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Distinguishing biologically {{relevant}} interfaces from lattice {{contacts in}} protein crystals {{is a fundamental}} problem in structural biology. Despite efforts towards the computational prediction of interface character, many issues are still unresolved. Results We present here a protein-protein interface classifier that relies on evolutionary data to detect the biological character of interfaces. The classifier uses a simple geometric measure, number <b>of</b> core <b>residues,</b> and two evolutionary indicators based on the sequence entropy of homolog sequences. Both aim at detecting differential selection pressure between interface core and rim or rest of surface. The core residues, defined as fully buried residues (> 95 % burial), appear to be fundamental determinants of biological interfaces: their number is in itself a powerful discriminator of interface character and together with the evolutionary measures {{it is able to}} clearly distinguish evolved biological contacts from crystal ones. We demonstrate that this <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> core <b>residues</b> leads to distinctively better results than earlier definitions from the literature. The stringent selection and quality filtering of structural and sequence data was key {{to the success of the}} method. Most importantly we demonstrate that a more conservative selection of homolog sequences - with relatively high sequence identities to the query - is able to produce a clearer signal than previous attempts. Conclusions An evolutionary approach like the one presented here is key to the advancement of the field, which so far was missing an effective method exploiting the evolutionary character of protein interfaces. Its coverage and performance will only improve over time thanks to the incessant growth of sequence databases. Currently our method reaches an accuracy of 89 % in classifying interfaces of the Ponstingl 2003 datasets and it lends itself to a variety of useful applications in structural biology and bioinformatics.

40|$|Sialic acid acetyl {{esterase}} (SIAE) removes acetyl moieties {{from the}} hydroxyl groups in position 9 and 4 of sialic acid. Recently, a dispute has been opened on its association to autoimmunity. In {{order to get}} new insights on human SIAE biology and to clarify its seemingly contradictory molecular properties, we combined in silico characterization, phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling with cellular studies in COS 7 cells. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis revealed that in most tissues only the "long" isoform, originally referred to lysosomal sialic acid esterase, is detected. Using the homology modeling approach, we predicted a model of SIAE 3 D structure, which fulfills the topological features of SGNH-hydrolase family. In addition, the model and site-directed mutagenesis experiments allowed the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>residues</b> involved in catalysis. SIAE transient expression revealed that the protein is glycosylated and is active in vitro as an esterase with a pH optimum corresponding to 8. 4 - 8. 5. Moreover, glycosylation influences the biological activity of the enzyme and is essential for release of SIAE into the culture medium. According to these findings, co-localization experiments demonstrated the presence of SIAE in membranous structures corresponding to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Thus, at least in COS 7 cells, SIAE behaves as a typical secreted enzyme, subjected to glycosylation and located along the classical secretory route or in the extracellular space. In these environments, the enzyme could act on 9 -O-acetylated sialic acid residues, contributing to the fine-tuning of the various functions played by this acidic sugar...|$|R
40|$|The Exergy Cost Theory (ECT) was {{proposed}} {{as a complete}} and formalized method {{to account for the}} exergy cost of system products, defining criteria for optimization and diagnosis purposes. In this paper, different practical approaches for the application of the Exergy Cost Analysis are presented and comparatively applied to the CGAM problem. An emphasis has been specially put on the possible approaches to define and to solve the system of exergy cost balances, including the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary relations and the reallocation of the exergy cost <b>of</b> <b>residues.</b> It is found that the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the functional diagram and the numerical solution of the system through Input-Output analysis seems to be preferable with respect to other approaches...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} result for the supercurrent across a superconductor/quantum-dot/superconductor junction. By converting the current integration into a special contour integral, we can express the current as a sum <b>of</b> the <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> poles. These poles are real {{and give a}} natural <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the Andreev bound states. We also use the exact result to explain some features of the supercurrent transport behavior.

40|$|Binary {{morphological}} transformations {{based on}} the residues (ultimate erosion, skeleton by openings, etc.) are extended to functions by means <b>of</b> the transformation <b>definition</b> and <b>of</b> its associated function {{based on the}} analysis <b>of</b> the <b>residue</b> evolution in every point of the image. This definition allows to build the transformed image and its associated function, indicating the value <b>of</b> the <b>residue</b> index for which this evolution is the most important. These definitions {{have the advantage of}} supplying effective tools for shape analysis and <b>of</b> allowing the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> new residual transforms together with their associated functions. Two <b>of</b> these numerical <b>residues</b> will be introduced, called respectively ultimate opening and quasi-distance and, through some applications, the interest and efficiency of these operators will be illustrated. Finally, this residual approach will be extended to more complex operators...|$|R
40|$|A {{proficiency}} test for tetracycline drug residues in poultry muscle was organized {{according to the}} guidelines of International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) ILAC-G 13 : 2000 (2000). For the {{proficiency test}}, three test materials were prepared. The homogeneity and stability of the materials during the study were demonstrated. Sixteen laboratories accepted the invitation {{to participate in the}} proficiency test; 11 laboratories reported results within the time frame of the study. Most notably, only four of the participating laboratories complied with the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the maximum <b>residue</b> limit (MRL) concerning the inclusion of 4 -epimers as stated in European Commission Regulation 281 / 96 (1996). Most participants reported values for the decision limit (CC) and detection capability (CC) and hence were already in compliance with European Commission 2002 / 657 /EC (2002) for this aspect of method validation. However, some CC and CC values were not in agreement with the actual within-laboratory reproducibility calculated from the results reported in this proficiency test. Although most laboratories obtained satisfactory results, it is clear that an effort is needed to include 4 -epiOTC, 4 -epiTC and 4 -epiCTC in the analytical methods. Moreover, reconsideration of values determined for CC and CC with respect to their accuracy may be necessary in some case...|$|R
