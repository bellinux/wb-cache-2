5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe side of it has the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a <b>front</b> <b>view,</b> holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws. The Ionian Islands formed part of the Venetian maritime trade route to the Orient.|$|E

The control panel shows planes crucial data, {{including}} speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel {{also features a}} radar that provided an overview of important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in <b>front</b> <b>view</b> and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean <b>front</b> <b>view</b> while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and {{an unknown number}} of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough {{on the top of the}} neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in <b>front</b> <b>view</b> protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in <b>front</b> <b>view.</b> Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in <b>front</b> <b>view</b> it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E

25|$|Like all {{methods of}} {{radiography}}, chest radiography employs ionizing radiation {{in the form}} of X-rays to generate images of the chest. The mean radiation dose to an adult from a chest radiograph is around 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) for a <b>front</b> <b>view</b> (PA or posterior-anterior) and 0.08 mSv (8 mrem) for a side view (LL or latero-lateral). Together, this corresponds to a background radiation equivalent time of about 10 days.|$|E
25|$|The House of Representatives Chamber has 448 {{permanent}} seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do {{not have}} assigned seats. The chamber {{is large enough to}} accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history.

25|$|During {{restoration}} in 2002, {{the back}} of the cloth was photographed and scanned for the first time. Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic corona discharge as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud. Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the <b>front</b> <b>view</b> of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those {{on the other side of}} the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} {{thin and}} fragile shell is {{small compared to}} what is known from the other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45mm with about 7½ whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2mm long to this taxon – a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length is always more than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at {{about the level of}} the apex of the aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in <b>front</b> <b>view</b> is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate-granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous periostracum. On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell.|$|E

500|$|Except at {{its base}} the reliquary is slim, with two faces; the <b>front</b> <b>view</b> shows {{the end of the}} world and the Last Judgement, with the Trinity and saints above and the resurrection of the dead below, and the relic of a single long thorn {{believed}} to come from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus when he was crucified. [...] The rear view has less extravagant decoration, mostly in plain gold in low relief, and has doors that opened to display a flat object, now missing, which was presumably another relic.|$|E
500|$|The spores of C.micaceus are reddish-brown, with {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 4.5–6µm. Generally, they are [...] (shaped like a biconvex lens), but {{viewed from the}} side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in <b>front</b> <b>view</b> they appear oval or mitriform (roughly {{the shape of a}} miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a germ pore, a flattened area {{in the center of the}} spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7µm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant, and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. Arthur Buller coined the term [...] to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.|$|E
