500|$|John Keats (The New York Times Book Review) {{described}} Compulsory Miseducation as [...] "passionate" [...] and [...] "eloquent". He called Goodman's propositions in {{the absence}} of formal schooling [...] "startling" [...] and characterized Goodman as [...] "a lonely humanist crying in a Philistine marketplace, where the largest single share of public wealth is devoted to the strategies of overkill, and where another enormous amount is dedicated to putting blinders on the probable victims." [...] Keats recommended the book for parents who put their children's welfare before their own. Eli M. Oboler (Library Journal), meanwhile, only recommended Goodman's [...] "polemic onslaught" [...] <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> [...] "contentious [...] disagreeable" [...] material. He wrote that Goodman's approach was unreasonable and contrarian: for instance, his stances in favor of sexual expression and against the importance of literacy in schools.|$|E

500|$|Suresh Krishnamoorthy of [...] The Hindu summarised, [...] "Magadheera {{is not for}} the weak-hearted, {{those who}} do not like the sight of blood and neither is it <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> movies with storylines that are much-closer-to-everyday- reality. But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|Devil's Halo was {{released}} by Downtown Records on October 6, 2009, to generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on seven reviews. In Billboard, Gary Graff wrote that the record [...] "neatly straddles a line between challenging and accessible", featuring some of Ndegéocello's strongest compositions yet. Jurek claimed she [...] "hasn't been so nakedly vulnerable and brazenly honest on record as she is here". Tyler Lewis of PopMatters hailed it as her most consistent and [...] "emotionally potent work" [...] since 1999's Bitter while adding that Devil's Halo featured [...] "a greater sense of perspective of life's realities". According to Q, the songs expressing frantic feelings were balanced by [...] "unpredictable but always apposite moments of beauty". Salon journalist Heather Havrilesky said [...] "like a world-weary muse, Ndegéocello taps into something rich and melancholy at the sludgy bottom of our hearts" [...] while possessing a [...] "mellow depth" [...] in her singing. Washington Post critic Mark Jenkins believed the music's [...] "stripped-down approach accentuated her musical brawn". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club found the album [...] "bracingly unpredictable and persistently enjoyable; it's an art-soul record <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> to be challenged while they’re tapping their toes. Or vice versa".|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's (ANN) {{review of}} the first volume states that [...] "Hibiki's Magic...focus on the ways that magic effects the {{everyday}} lives of its users. The personal focus is welcome, but {{the book is a}} little too compressed and rushed to evoke exactly the emotional response that it desires." [...] While at the same time describing the first volume as having an [...] "inspirational tone", the review ends by saying, [...] "Don't come to Hibiki's Magic expecting a life-changing re-examination of magic. It's a heavy dose of pure cuteness <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> their sweet-and-sour drama with lots of cheese." [...] The first volume of Hibiki's Magic was featured in ANN's Right Turn Only column in January 2007, where Carlo Santos compares the series to [...] "Someday's Dreamers with more guts and heart," [...] which portrays magicians as similar to normal people with [...] "weaknesses and all" [...] as opposed to [...] "other tales of magic [...] focus on how cool and different magicians are [...]" [...] Visually, the series is described as being too similar to [...] "every other fantasy series" [...] and even cites similarities with [...] "Hogwarts' magic robes and school logo." [...] IGN Comics' review said, [...] "This book ought to be fairly popular for its intended age group....Make no mistake, this book is cute {{in every sense of the}} word...but at the same time it's a solid story that breaks out of that cuteness mold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Colin McNamara of Reflection of Darkness {{gave the}} album nine stars of ten, stating [...] "For Godsmack fans {{who felt that}} their latest album, The Oracle, was a letdown {{due to a lack}} of tribal/spiritual influences, Avalon is the perfect remedy for that.", then he added, [...] "Every song is a spiritual journey that doesn’t preach religion, just the stuff of life. Erna {{certainly}} respects his Wicca/ pagan beliefs, but his ultimate goal with Avalon was to connect his own life through readers in numerous ways, not his religious practices. Definitely worth looking into <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> new age or acoustic music with strong messages." ...|$|E

50|$|The hard-packed sand of Volusia County's beaches lent {{itself to}} auto races {{beginning}} in 1903, before paved roads were common, {{leading to the}} area's reputation for cars and racing. Ormond Beach was a popular spot <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>liked</b> fast cars {{after the turn of}} the 20th century because the hard-packed beach was ideal for going fast. That same beach had led to the development of a tourist resort by Henry Flagler. It later attracted Flagler's former business partner John D. Rockefeller, who had a winter home in Ormond.|$|R

2500|$|Levels of competition, {{based on}} skill, range from {{recreational}} to competitive, and include: Rec, C, B, BB, A, and AA and AAA, with AA being {{the highest level}} at which league competition occurs. [...] AAA ringette is typically specific to particular regions who feel another category is necessary to clarify their league or tournament play. For example: AAA teams out of Quebec have played AA teams out of Alberta at various tournaments, including the National Championships. In Alberta, the highest level considered is AA, although they are deemed equal to the AAA teams from areas such as Quebec. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> the hockey parallel, playing AA ringette {{is the same as}} playing AAA hockey. The National Ringette League was introduced in 2004-2005 season and includes open-aged players at AA/AAA level.|$|E
2500|$|However, a few critics took a more-mixed {{view of the}} album. Emma Johnston {{from the}} English {{language}} version of Metal Hammer rated the album six out of ten, pointing out that [...] "there's little here to have progressive scene-leaders like Opeth looking over their shoulders." [...] She elaborated that apart from the string-drenched interlude on [...] "Dawn of Redemption", [...] "Extol hardly shifts out of a single gear, but it's worth a listen <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> their genres bobbing around in a big old melting pot." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, this one did not entirely click with him. He concluded that [...] "The music itself was excellence {{in and of itself}} but perhaps it was the odd mix of vocals that let me down. I guarantee after a few listens even a doubter like me will warm up to return of Extol and the album they've always intended to create." [...] Mario of Metal 4 rated the album six out of ten, stating the while the album is decent, it also is fairly predictable.|$|E
2500|$|The English {{version of}} NTR: Netsuzou Trap has {{received}} mixed reviews from manga critics. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network gave the series an overall C+ grade. She {{felt that it}} is a [...] "fairly unusual yuri story", similar to what is seen in yaoi, because of the sexually aggressive nature of the romance. Silverman stated there is a strong indication that Hotaru is using boys to get over Yuma, and that Hotaru not appearing to particularly love Yuma might be masked feelings due to past problems. Although Silverman felt that it is good that the series offers variety <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>like</b> this kind of story, and that, unlike with Hotaru, readers get a better feel for Yuma's character, she felt that the story's [...] "less consensual romance" [...] is uncomfortable, and critiqued the artwork of the character's upper bodies; she did, however, praise the artwork involving the character's legs. Transgender activist Kat Callahan agreed with Silverman on the series not being a typical example of a yuri series. She writes in her review that the series deals with the cycle of abuse when it comes to Hotaru, and that Yuma is also a victim as a result.|$|E
