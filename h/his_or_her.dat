However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also {{report to the}} Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> orders and without <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> sanction or connivance, or that of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} Pokémon {{role-playing}} games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, {{in which the}} player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a move for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive {{a certain amount of}} experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.|$|E

The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E

5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> possession or under <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking {{that he or she}} embark on a journey and fill <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> Pokédex.|$|E
