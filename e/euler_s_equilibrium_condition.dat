40|$|This paper {{examines}} the quantitative implications of government fiscal policy in a discrete-time one-sector growth {{model with a}} productive externality that generates social increasing returns to scale. Starting from a laissez-faire economy that exhibits local indeterminacy, we show that {{the introduction of a}} constant capital tax or subsidy can lead to various forms of endogenous fluctuations, including stable 2 -, 4 -, 8 -, and 10 -cycles, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaos. In contrast, a constant labor tax or subsidy has no effect on the qualitative nature of the model s dynamics. We show that the use of local steady-state analysis to detect the presence of multiple equilibria in this class of models can be misleading. For a plausible range of capital tax rates, the log-linearized dynamical system exhibits saddle-point stability, suggesting a unique equilibrium, whereas the true nonlinear model exhibits global indeterminacy. This result implies that stabilization policies designed to suppress sunspot fluctuations near the steady state may not prevent sunspots, cycles, or chaos in regions away from the steady state. Overall, our results highlight the importance of using a model <b>s</b> nonlinear <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> to fully investigate global dynamics. ...|$|R

Observed and predicted relative ionization fractions are then compared to determine the electron and radiation temperatures. Crude and refined estimates of the mass-loss rate and velocity law are made, and radiative acceleration in the expanding envelope is analyzed. The derived model for Zeta Pup is found to have a mass-loss rate of about 7. 2 millionths of a solar mass per year, a wind velocity that increases slowly outward and reaches 700 km/s about 28 solar masses, and a nearly isothermal envelope with an electron temperature of approximately 200, 000 K...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{aquifers}} {{suitable for}} CO 2 sequestration contain measurable concentration of dissolved non-hydrocarbon species. In this paper, the compositional modelling of the CO 2 injection into aquifers that contain dissolved hydrogen sulfide, described here as sour aquifers, is studied. According {{to the results}} of this study, when CO 2 is injected into such aquifers, exsolution of dissolved components will occur and gaseous H 2 S will accumulate at {{the leading edge of the}} CO 2 plume. At any time after the start of CO 2 injection, the region swept by the plume consists of two sub-regions. An inner radial sub-region extending from the injection well is characterized by the absence of H 2 S in both the aqueous (brine) and gaseous (supercritical CO 2) phases. The dissolved H 2 S in this first sub-region is almost completely removed from the brine and released to the migrating gas phase. The second sub-region extends from the outer edge of the first sub-region to the leading edge of the gas plume. In this outer sub-region, the mole fraction of H 2 S in the CO 2 plume gradually increases toward a constant value at the edge (which is defined by the CO 2 -H 2 O-H 2 <b>S</b> phase <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> at specific temperature, pressure, and salinity of the brine) and thereafter only the size of this sub-region progressively increases. For dissolved H 2 S concentrations typically found in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, mole fraction of gaseous H 2 S in the leading edge of the gas plume can be higher than 50 %. This may have important implications for assessing the risk of CO 2 injection into sour aquifers. Leakage into abandoned wells, for example, might plausibly occur when the gas phase first reaches the wellbore, so initial leakage may contain substantial amounts of H 2 S even though the average H 2 S fraction in the stored CO 2 is quite small. H 2 S is highly toxic, with acute short term toxicity at 100 to 1000 times larger than that of CO 2. This suggests that one need to account for this phenomenon when establishing risk assessment, monitoring and management strategies at planned CO 2 geo-storage sites...|$|R

We examine this proof closely and, with the help of some insight provided by a modern (and completely dierent) proof of the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, we present a rational reconstruction in terms which could be considered rigorous by modern Weierstrassian standards. At the same time, with a few ideas borrowed from nonstandard analysis we see how the same reconstruction can be also be considered rigorous by modern Robinsonian standards. This last approach, though, is completely in tune with Goldbach and <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> proof.

40|$|AbstractFuel {{management}} of once-through-then-out (OTTO) cycle Pebble Bed Reactors (PBR) was studied, {{in particular the}} start-up condition of the core before it achieves the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> Optimum and simple fuel management performance in the start-up condition {{is important for the}} practical deployment of PBR. There is no option for fuel re-insertion in an OTTO cycle PBR, hence nuclear fuel utilization is an important factor not only in the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> but also in the start-up condition. The {{purpose of the study was}} to find an optimum procedure to improve burnup performance of fuel management in startup of the OTTO cycle PBR. Initial Heavy Metal (HM) loading in the core, power density, and multiplication factors were the main parameters investigated. The target of the analysis was a small sized 10 MW PBR. A newly developed code system for OTTO cycle PBR was used. The code system is capable of performing neutron transport and depletion calculations of the OTTO cycle PBR covering whole of its fuel management scheme from initial loading to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition.</b> In this study, fuel composition in the start-up condition was limited to the same composition (a single enrichment) as the fuel in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> for simplicity of the whole fuel management. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> of the PBR was investigated first. Based on the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> two start-up fuel management schemes, a mixed and top-bottom scheme, were investigated. It was found that mixed scheme is better compare to top bottom scheme in achieving efficient HM-loading. Mixed scheme also gave a lower maximum power density. For the chosen target equilibrium design with 10 wt% enrichment and 12 g-HM/pebble the minimum initial HM-loading using mixed and top-bottom scheme was 97. 1 kg and 161. 9 kg, respectively. While the maximum power density at that minimum initial loading was 4. 5 W/cm 3 and 4. 9 W/cm 3, respectively...|$|R
