40|$|This report APRIL, {{which is}} a {{prototype}} implementation of the non-standard database system PRODAT developed in the PROSYT project. The PRODAT object model is a derivative of the Entity-Relationship Model with a special focus on complex objects. It provides attributed objects with longfields and a structuring mechanism to build arbitrary acyclic object graphs. Further PRODAT concepts implemented in APRIL are versions, a transaction concept taylored to the data model, and an integrated archiving component. Some other parts defined in PRODAT are emitted in APRIL, among others because it is directed to graphics applications and their data handling. In APRIL, interfaces are offered on three different levels: There is a procedural C interface which covers the whole functionality, two <b>alphanumeric</b> interpeters (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> for batch jobs), and a graphical interactive database editor, the so-called object editor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} {{underlying}} vision, the approach, {{the current status}} and the gained experiences {{in the attempt to}} establish a personal and electronic health record (PEHR) system in the Rhine-Neckar Region. First, an electronic health record (EHR) shall be implemented, which is in a second step expanded by a personal health record (PHR) in order to form a PEHR. Integration between the PEHR and the source systems is achieved with international standards (HL 7, DICOM, IHE) and existing technologies. Non-image information (<b>alphanumeric</b> data, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> reports, lab results) is replicated; image information is replicated and then referenced after 3 months for capacity reasons. The approach to use off-the-shelf technologies and existing international standards proved successful but current HIS/EPR systems need to improve their support. Major issues could be indentified for the management of access rights and data privacy when using only EHR approaches. PHR is superior for as well ethical as technical reasons. More attention has to be paid to organisational aspects in order to truly empower patients. Uvajanje osebnega elektronskega zdravstvenega zapisa v regiji Rhine-Necka...|$|R

40|$|Here {{follow a}} couple of remarks, which might {{improve the quality of}} essays and reports: • Essays and reports should contain title, table of contents, introduction, conclusion, list of {{references}} (which must not consist of web addresses only), citations in the text, and numbered chapters. • To copy sentences and small paragraphs from other texts is acceptable, if cited correctly (especially, quotation marks should be put around them). To do this for longer paragraphs doesn’t give a good impression. It is a violation of the university policy on plagiarism, to copy material from other sources without making this explicit in the text. Such a violation might have serious consequences. • The same rules apply to pictures taken from somewhere else: it should be cited where they have been taken from. • Usually, using L ATEXor TEX, a much higher quality is achieved. • Justify the text left and right (in L ATEX, this is done automatically, under Word, there is a button for doing this). • References to literature should be added in a proper way: – There are several schemata for introducing abbreviations, two of them are: ∗ Numbers in square brackets <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> [5]. 1 ∗ <b>Alphanumeric</b> references, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> [Sm 98] for an article written 1998 by John Smith, [Sm 98 a], [Sm 98 b] if there are two articles by the same author, [AS 01] for an article written by Adams and Smith 2001, [ASJ 01] for an article written by Adams, Smith and Jones, 2001). – Below follows an example of a bibliography. The order in each entry (author, book-title, edition, publisher, year, page number; note that sometimes one takes an article in a collection of articles – then {{the author of the book}} is usually an editor and the title of the book is in italics whereas the title of the article itself is not; an example is [3] below) and the use of Roman and italic font is particularly important (however one might follow a different schema, as long as it is one typically used in scientific literature).

40|$|The {{valorisation}} of {{the urban}} heritage is presently one of main topics discussed, mostly in the theme related conferences, treaties, conventions and programs. Mobile platforms (especially smartphones and tablets) may be very useful technological means for the agents in the territory. Admitting these assumptions, we created an information model for a mobile application (app) development, with a specific theme (water and city) that represents and describes architectural elements of a city. The selected architectural elements are those related with the water supply system in Lisbon built from XVIII to the XIX century. The inclusion of these elements in a mobile platform requires 3 D modelling, improving the visualization and <b>alphanumeric</b> information access (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> historical) very useful to the agents (in particular to the city visitors). 3 D models were created based on terrestrial and UAV surveys, considering rapid and authentic data acquisition. The stages of building the models were: i) Data acquisition (UAV - flight planning and image acquisition); ii) Data processing; iii) Data visualization (App/AR). The created models are very realistic. However, the results may differ when processing the data in different software, especially concerning the level of detail. The technical challenge is to simplify the models to use in mobile platforms and maintain the level of realism.

5000|$|Geschwaders, {{other than}} day fighters, {{during the war}} usually bore a four-character {{identification}} code, starting with a two-character alphanumeric [...] (a code unique to each Geschwader) {{to the left of}} the national Balkenkreuz marking and two letters to the right, signifying the individual aircraft's letter within its Staffel as the third letter and the Staffel-designating letter within the Geschwader as the fourth and last letter. The full four-character code was usually shown on the fuselage sides, sometimes with the individual aircraft letter repeated under the wings. Gruppe and Staffel-sized units could also have their own unique codes of this type, most often used for reconnaissance and maritime aviation groups and Wekusta weather observation squadrons, with Staffel sized units using the <b>four-character</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code almost always using an [...] "H" [...] as the fourth and last character. Late in the war, the first two characters of the Geschwaderkennung code (designating the geschwader) were depicted on the fuselage sides in a much reduced size, possibly as a [...] "low-visibility" [...] security measure.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that goal priming effects are context dependent. We show that goal primes encourage prime-consistent behavior when the behavioral context is common and prime-inconsistent behavior when the behavioral context is un-common. While the prime-consistent behavior is compatible with existing theory, the prime-inconsistent behavior poses a theoretical challenge. We argue that un-common behavioral contexts encourage {{the release of a}} primed goal and, as a consequence, an increase in the relative activation of information inconsistent with the primed goal and prime-inconsistent behavior. The influence of priming in consumer behavior is ubiq-uitous. Primes have been shown to influence product evaluations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Brendl, Markman, and Messner 2003), consideration set formation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shapiro 1999), choices (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Chun and Kruglanski 2005; Sheeran et al. 2005), the extremity of behavior (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang, Reed, and Croson 2008), and product experience (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Aaker and Stayman 1992). The pervasive influence of primes has also led to an exten-sive documentation of the processes supporting priming ef-fects.

This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to live longer), sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to support their sporting goals), physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness) and social influences (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> making friends), physical and mental health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> peer influence), while busy lifestyles (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> lack of time), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), cognitive-emotional (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> feelings of inferiority) and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity. Responses varied little by BMI status. Conclusion: This research emphasises the importance of consulting young men when developing healthy lifestyle programs that aim to promote healthy eating and physical activity in young men.

What is the purpose of assessing sustainability of forest management (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> operations, planning, policy, international agreements) ? 2. What scale is relevant (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> compartment, forest, watershed, nation, global) ? 3. What actors are involved (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> communities, government, corporations) ? 4. What are relevant sustainability goals to be discussed among actors (consider economics <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> yields, revenue; ecology <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> biodiversity, water quality; social aspects <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> tenure) 5. Assess sustainability goals and highlight information requirements in the light of system behaviour and use, with special consideration of the likely timing and location of potential problems (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> anticipated or unpredictable, minor or catastrophic, single event or continuing trend, localized or widespread), and the anticipated nature of observable problems. 6. Define indicators of sustainability and consider suitable measurement scales (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> present/absent, qualitative, quantitative). 7. Define when, where and how to measure these indicators, giving special attention to the sampling scheme (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> purposive, systematic, stratified random). 8. Select and apply a suitable assessment methodology (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> permanent sample plots, environmental impact assessment, forest resource accounting, cost-benefit analysis). 9.
