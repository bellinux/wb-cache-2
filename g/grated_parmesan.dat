50|$|Grated {{cheese is}} a type of cheese that has gone through the process of being grated. Typically, aged hard cheeses are used for this purpose. A hand grater can be used to {{manually}} grate the cheese, or cheese can be bought already grated. Commercially produced grated cheeses are often blends of more than one variety of cheese, such as Pecorino and <b>Parmesan.</b> <b>Grated</b> cheese and shredded cheese are not the same thing.

40|$|Developing low-fat {{cheese with}} flavor to match that of full-fat cheese {{has been a}} {{challenge}} in the dairy industry. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to develop lower fat Cheddar and <b>Parmesan</b> <b>grated</b> cheese using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and characterize its flavor profile comparative to a full-fat product. Specifically, enabling flavor compound partition between the matrices of cheese and extracted lipids. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) was the supercritical fluid for fat extraction. Extraction took place in a 500 mL SFE vessel using 100 g of grated cheese. Fractional factorial design was utilized to investigate two levels of treatment for each pressure (200 and 350 bar), temperature (35 and 40 °C) and CO 2 level (500 and 1000 g) for each extraction trial. The most efficient parameters for lipid removal resulted in 51. 00 % fat reduction (wet basis) for Cheddar extracted at 200 bar, 40 °C, 1000 g CO 2, and 55. 56 % fat reduction for Parmesan extracted at 350 bar, 35 °C, 1000 g CO 2. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was utilized to assess the lipid composition of each cheese and the lipids extracted by SFE. TLC analysis for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses showed only nonpolar lipids (triaclyglycerides and free fatty acids) in the recovered lipids extracted by SFE; indicating that polar lipids such as phospholipids are being retained in the cheese matrix. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize volatile flavor compounds for each cheese sample. SFE treatment of the cheeses altered the ability to detect flavor compounds and allowed partitioning of those compounds, which varied with the type of cheese. This study suggests that SFE technology can be used in the dairy industry to develop cheese products lower in fat, which retain flavor compounds that may not be typically fully developed with alternative methods of low-fat cheese processing...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effects of water activity, {{particle}} size distribution and free fat content on flowability of <b>Grated</b> and Dried <b>Parmesan</b> cheese made by Greenwood Valley Cheese Company (GVC) and by Kraft. The three parameters were modified to span a wide range around the original level of each. Water activity (Aw) was decreased / increased through water sorption. A range of particle sizes for each of the samples was obtained by separating the samples into two fractions and then combining them together to different levels. Samples were sieved through a stack of sieves with different mesh sizes and particle size was expressed in terms of median particle size. A range of free fat levels was obtained by spraying samples with anhydrous milk fat (AMF). The response of flowability to changes in these parameters was assessed. Flowability was measured by using a rotating drum. The results in the preliminary study showed that flowability increased with increasing moisture content from 18 to 22 %, which is in contradiction to the normal expectation from the literature. Therefore, the hypothesis: flowability increases with increasing moisture content / Aw was proposed. To test the validity of the hypothesis, several trials were conducted. The results in the first trial showed that flowability increased with increasing Aw from 0. 66 to 0. 79 for both GVC and Kraft products. The results also revealed a possible critical Aw between 0. 79 to 0. 83 at which the products could have their optimum flowability. In the next trial, additional values in the Aw range between 0. 79 to 0. 83 were included. The results showed that flowability increased with increasing Aw from 0. 67 to the critical Aw value and dropped down above this value. The critical Aw values for GVC products were determined at 0. 80 ± 0. 01. Kraft's product did not show this increasing trend or the critical Aw value. A series of commercial samples with different Aw levels from two of each of GVC products were chosen to test the hypothesis. Variation in water activity naturally occurred during processing due to the slight changes in drying conditions. The results obtained on these commercial samples showed flowability increased with increasing Aw from 0. 69 to 0. 77, Therefore, the hypothesis has been proven. The study on the effect of particle size shows flowability also increased with increasing median particle size for both GVC and Kraft products. Of the methods chosen to plot cumulative undersize versus sieve size, linear regression is suggested rather than simply joining the points. This is because all the points are taken into account when linear regression is used. The study conducted on the effect of free fat shows that flowability decreased with increasing free fat levels from 16. 8 to 26. 3 %. The sieve analysis results on the samples with different free fat levels show that median particle size increased from 721 to 1476 μm with increasing free fat levels from 16. 8 to 26. 3 %. This was presumably caused by particle aggregation. The results show that the positive effect of particle size on flowability could not counteract the negative effect of free fat. Further study is required to confirm the net effect of free fat and particle size...|$|R

The constant stirring, with {{only a small amount}} of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch molecules from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible.

50|$|Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called {{spaghetti}} alla bolognese, or colloquially spag bol or just spaghetti) is a pasta dish {{consisting of}} spaghetti {{served with a}} sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef garlic wine and herbs; sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats. In this sense it is actually more similar to Neapolitan ragu from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of Ragu. Often accused of 'inauthenticity' when encountered by Italians abroad, it may be served with {{a larger proportion of}} sauce to spaghetti than is common in some Italian spaghetti dishes, and the sauce may be laid on top of the spaghetti (rather than being mixed into it, as Italian custom) or even served separately from it (so that the diner can mix to his or her preference). It is often served with <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> on top as in Italy, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also often substituted. The sauce is commonly referred to as Bolognese sauce or just spaghetti sauce, but is actually closer to a Southern or Central Italian style of pasta dish, as true Bolognese sauce would be served only with tagliatelle ribbons rather than spaghetti in Italy.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} hygienic and sanitary conditions of <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> cheese acquired from the retail business, total 120 cheese samples were acquired: 60 of which were obtained from four different brands of cheese that were grated in factories, and the other 60 samples were obtained from another four brands of cheese that are normally acquired by retailers (supermarkets) in blocks and grated {{at the moment of}} sale. The population of heterotrophic mesophilic microorganisms ranged from 1. 2 × 10 ³ to 1. 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) ·g- 1. All samples analyzed contained Staphylococcus spp. with populations varying from 1. 2 × 10 ³ to 8. 7 × 106 CFU·g- 1, from which 60. 0 % were classified as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and 52. 5 % of the samples possessed populations above the permissible limit set by legislation. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 57. 5 % of the samples. Population of molds and yeasts varied from < 10 to 1. 8 × 106 CFU·g- 1. Salmonella spp. was not isolated in this research.
