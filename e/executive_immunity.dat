500|$|Just {{prior to}} the Supreme Court's ruling, the grand jury handed down indictments against Fletcher for three misdemeanors – conspiracy, {{official}} misconduct, and political discrimination. Fletcher did not appear at his arraignment on June 9 because he was on vacation in Florida; his attorney entered [...] "not guilty" [...] pleas to all three charges on his behalf. On August 11, 2006, Special Judge David E. Melcher ruled that because the personnel violations were allegedly committed while Fletcher was acting in his official capacity as governor, he was protected by <b>executive</b> <b>immunity</b> {{and could not be}} prosecuted until he left office. Melcher asked that the two sides work together to reach a settlement in the case. On August 24, Fletcher and Stumbo announced such an agreement. Under the settlement, Fletcher acknowledged that evidence [...] "strongly indicate wrongdoing by his administration" [...] but did not admit any wrongdoing personally. Fletcher also acknowledged that Stumbo's prosecution of the case [...] " [...] necessary and proper [...] of his constitutional duty" [...] and ensured that abuses of the merit system would be ended. In addition to dropping the charges against Fletcher, Stumbo conceded that any violations by Fletcher's administration were [...] "without malice". Four members of the state Personnel Board who were appointed by Fletcher were required to step down. Their replacements would be chosen by Fletcher from a list provided by Stumbo.|$|E

40|$|The Attorney-General, Senator the Hon George Brandis QC, {{has asked}} the Australian Law Reform Commission to review Commonwealth {{legislation}} to identify provisions that unreasonably encroach upon traditional rights, freedoms and privileges.

40|$|In the United States, where “all men {{are created}} equal,” every person must obey {{the laws of the}} {{community}} and the nation or pay the penalty for his failure to do so. This principle, in the abstract, would go unchallenged. However, as is so often the case, when principles are translated into policies, the national consensus vanishes and disagreements arise. It can be rationally argued that the public welfare will best be served when certain persons are not subject to all the laws of the land. The concept of public officer immunity from private tort actions has been around for centuries and has been applied by federal, state, and local courts to various public officers ranging from local school board members to members of the President 2 ̆ 7 s cabinet. In the recent case of Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the United States Supreme Court, for the first time, addressed the issue {{of the extent to which}} the President of the United States is entitled to immunity from civil actions. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s five to four decision allowing the President absolute immunity from civil suits arising from actions taken by him within 2 ̆ 2 the outer perimeter of his authority, 2 ̆ 2 draws into question the actual validity of the principle that 2 ̆ 2 no man is above the law. 2 ̆ 2 This Note examines the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Nixon v.

40|$|The vice {{presidency}} of Dick Cheney from 2000 to 2008 raised complicated {{questions about the}} constitutional and legal position of the Vice President, including the Vice President 2 ̆ 7 s amenability to civil suits for damages. The U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s <b>executive</b> <b>immunity</b> jurisprudence has established that the President can claim absolute immunity for official acts, while cabinet members and presidential aides can assert only qualified immunity. No court has ever determined if the Vice President should be granted absolute or qualified immunity in civil suits for damages. Acknowledging that the {{vice presidency}} is an increasingly important political office, this Note argues that neither the Vice President 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional status nor his specific functions justify a grant of absolute immunity, This Note asserts that although the Vice President could claim some limited form of legislative immunity, qualified immunity is the appropriate standard in most suits for damages. This Note contends that qualified immunity for the Vice President would both preserve the effective functioning {{of the executive branch}} and ensure that the Vice President is legally accountable for an abuse of power...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} first {{presented}} at the Temple Law Review Symposium on Executive Power. In Reynolds v. United States, the Supreme Court shaped the state secrets privilege (the Privilege) as one akin to that against self-incrimination. In recent litigation, the government has asserted the Privilege in motions for pre-discovery dismissal, thus transforming the Privilege into a form of <b>executive</b> <b>immunity.</b> This Paper argues that courts must step in to return the Privilege to a scope more in keeping with {{its status as a}} form of evidentiary privilege. After reviewing the doctrinal origins of the Privilege, the Paper explores three types of issues implicated by the government 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of the Privilege. The government, in calling for judicial deference to executive assertions of the Privilege, often realies on (1) separation of powers arguments or on (2) arguments sounding in institutional competence. Courts are often swayed by such arguments and thus give relatively little consideration to the (3) conflict of interest inherent in the government 2 ̆ 7 s assertion of the Privilege and the impact of the successful invocation of the Privilege on the rights of individual litigants. The Paper then proceeds to address arguments that Congress can provide a check on executive abuse of the Privilege. The Paper argues that, assuming that Congress has constitutional authority, it lacks the will or the institutional competence to provide a proper solution to the problems raised by the Privilege. Instead, the Paper contends that, since courts created the Privilege, courts are best positioned to rein it in. The final section of the Paper provides examples drawn from case law illustrating mechanisms whereby courts can protect state secrets while also giving litigants adverse to the government their day in court...|$|E
40|$|In 1978, Ernest Fitzgerald sued Richard Nixon, and in 1994, Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton. In a {{landmark}} but closely divided 1982 opinion, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court sided with Nixon and against Fitzgerald. What {{does this mean}} for Jones and Clinton today? Ed Meese speaks for many when he insists that Nixon protects Presidents only for presidential conduct and that extending immunity to Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s pre-presidential conduct would be a huge and unprincipled stretch that would place Bill Clinton above the law. Other com- mentators aren 2 ̆ 7 t so sure that Nixon itself was rightly decided but are sure that Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s claim is much weaker. Terry Eastland has argued that, if you reject Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s immunity claim, you presumably must reject Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s a fortiori. We will show that all of this is dead wrong. Bill Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s claim for immunity is actually much stronger than Richard Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s - supported by crisper arguments from constitutional text and structure, by more historical evidence from the Founding and early Republic, and by better modern-day policy arguments. Nixon sought absolute and permanent immunity from a civil damage action after he left office; Clinton seeks only temporary immunity from litigating a civil damage suit while he serves as President. We will show that the Arrest Clause of Article I, Section 6 and the democratic structural principles underly- ing this Clause cast light on Article II, and provide a sturdy constitutional basis for temporary presidential immunity. In the process of elaborating the best argument for Clinton, we will also show how all nine Justices in Nixon missed the point and in particular misread a key quote from the great Justice Joseph Story. We will outline a new theory of limited <b>executive</b> <b>immunity</b> that protects a sitting President and (most importantly) the American people he serves, yet does not put the President above the law, as Nixon did, despite the Court 2 ̆ 7 s protestations to the contrary...|$|E
