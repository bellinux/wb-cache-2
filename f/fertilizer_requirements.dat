40|$|In a {{study using}} data from 57 wheat field {{experiments}} on the central-western slopes of New South Wales, eight soil phosphate tests (Bray,, Bray,, alkaline fluoride, Mehlich, Truog, lactate, Olsen and Colwell) were evaluated and calibrated in terms of responsiveness (â) and response curvature (C) parameters derived from the Mitscherlich equation. The results showed that, regardless of how well correlated a soil test is with yield responsiveness, it cannot give a satisfactory estimate of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirement</b> unless yield response curvature is also taken into account. The tendency of soil test values, especially of the Colwell test, to be negatively related to response curvature, and hence inversely related to fertilizer effectiveness, compounded the problem of directly relating soil test values to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirement.</b> The best test (lactate) accounted for only 28...|$|R
30|$|In this study, the {{determinants}} of adoption of IMVs in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana were investigated. The results show that farm labour, maize experience, availability of variety, information availability, low yield, early maturity, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirement</b> and cost of variety were the major discriminating variables in classifying farmers in the study areas. The study revealed that maize experience, low yield, information availability and cost of variety were the most influential discriminating variables between adopters and non-adopters of IMVs. It is therefore recommended that soil scientists and crop breeders should consider an improvement in the specific varietal characteristics identified as influencing adoption of IMVs. Priority can be given to development of maize varieties whose <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirement</b> is low and which are early maturing and high yield. Also agricultural extension division of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) should consider organizing on-farm trials with the farmers in order to accelerate their adoption of the IMVs. The ministry of Agriculture through the public information department should intensify public educations through radio, community dabbers and any available platform to increase farmer’s knowledge on new agricultural technologies.|$|R

Advantages of mosses over higher plants in green roofs include reduced weight loads, increased water absorption, no <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirements,</b> and high drought tolerance. Since mosses {{do not have}} true roots, they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems. With proper species selection for the local climate, mosses in green roofs require no irrigation once established and are low maintenance.|$|E

These variables were as follows: storage/streak resistance, recycle grain (replanting), mature late, weed resistance, grain quality (grain colour/texture), low yield, water stress resistance, mature early, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirement,</b> information availability, diseases/pest resistances, soil fertility requirement and cost. In addition to these variables, farmers characteristics such as age of farmer, total farm labour and experience in maize farming were used in the analysis.|$|R

50|$|The <b>fertilizer</b> <b>requirements</b> {{for growing}} duckweed {{depend on the}} water source and the {{geographic}} isolate of L. minor that is used. L. minor grown in ponds that are filled with rainwater, need an additional application of Nitrogen, Phosphor and Potassium. Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen should not drop below 20-30 mg/l if high growth rates and crude protein contents want to be maintained. Regarding phosphorus, good growth {{has been reported in}} concentrations between 6 and 154 mg/l (there is no notable sensitivity for high phosphorus concentrations on growth rates). Effluents from domestic animal production have very high concentrations of ammonium and other minerals. They often need to be diluted to a balanced nutrient concentration. For the L. minor isolate 8627 cultivated in swine lagoon liquid, the best production rates were reached when grown in swine lagoon liquid diluted to 20% (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen: 54 mg/l, Ammonium: 31 mg/l, Total Phosphorus: 16 mg/l). Sewage water, which often has an adequate concentration of potassium and phosphorus can be used to grow duckweed, but nitrogen concentrations need to be adjusted.|$|E

40|$|Lentil and {{chickpea}} are dietary staple {{crops in}} Bangladesh but their local production has been markedly declining in recent decades, mainly due to competition with irrigated cereals.
