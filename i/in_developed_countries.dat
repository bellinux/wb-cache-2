5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. <b>In</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates how mobile {{technology}} usage could help to bring Information and communication technologies (ICT) {{to the people}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Some people <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> have access to use ICT while other {{people do not have}} such opportunity. This digital divide among people is present <b>in</b> many <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> where computers and the Internet are difficult to access. The Internet provides information that can increase productivity and enable markets to function more efficiently. The Internet reduces information travel time and provides more efficient ways for firms and workers to operate. ICT and the Internet can provide opportunities for economic growth and productivity <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This indicates that {{it is very important to}} bridge the digital divide and increase Internet connections <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how can {{mobile technology}} and mobile services help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Theoretical background of this thesis consists of a collection of articles and reports. Theoretical material was gathered by going through literature on the digital divide, mobile technology and mobile application development. The empirical research was conducted by sending a questionnaire by email to a selection of application developers located <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> The questionnaire’s purpose was to gather qualitative information concerning mobile application development <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This thesis main result suggests that mobile phones and mobile technology usage can help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This study finds that mobile technology provides one of the best tools that can help to bridge the digital divide <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Mobile technology can bring affordable ICT to people who do not have access to use computers.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} magnitude and scope of automotive pollutant emissions <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and their role in global warming, regional scale air pollution and urban air quality. Greenhouse-gas emissions (CO 2 and CFCs) from motor vehicles <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> contribute less than 3 % to the global greenhouse effect, compared to a 9 to 12 % contribution from motor vehicles in OECD countries and Eastern Europe. The share of OECD countries in conventional pollutant {{emissions from motor vehicles}} exceeds the combined contribution of all <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> by a factor of three to five. Acid deposition from motor vehicle emissions does not currently appear to be a problem <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> The incidence of regional scale ozone is not known but could be potentially significant downstream from large urban centers. There is a need for more systematic monitoring and evaluation of acid deposition and regional ozone concentrations <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Urban air quality is the prime casualty of motorization <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> The air pollution problem will intensify <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> with increasing urbanization and the rapid pace of motorization. Urban concentrations of carbon monoxide, airborne lead, particulate matter and sulfur oxides <b>in</b> many <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> already exceed the levels in industrialized countries.
