Accurate assessment of the soil moisture state and its spatial and temporal dynamics is therefore of crosscutting importance for many disciplines. Considerable technological progress {{during the last three}} decades leave no doubt that remote sensing from space afford the possibility of obtaining frequent global sampling of soil moisture over large fractions of the earth surface. Only recently the first global soil moisture data set based on remotely sensed data has been presented. The data set is derived from measurements taken by the ERS scatterometer, a coarse resolution active microwave instrument. First validation studies, using soil moisture data from global climate models and field data, indicate the good overall performance of the derived information.
