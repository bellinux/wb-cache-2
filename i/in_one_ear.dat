50|$|As a counselor, the eudaemon whispered {{advice and}} {{opinions}} <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>ear.</b> Such person escorted by the eudaemon was considered fortunate. It {{was said that}} Socrates during his lifetime had a daemon that always warned him of threats and bad judgment, but never directed his actions. According to Socrates, his daemon was more accurate than the respected forms of divination at that time, such as either reading the entrails or watching the flights of birds.|$|R
50|$|Tinnitus {{occurring}} <b>in</b> only <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> should {{prompt the}} clinician to initiate further evaluation for other etiologies. In addition, {{the presence of}} a pulse-synchronous rushing sound may require additional imaging to exclude vascular disorders.|$|R
50|$|Hearing loss is {{categorized}} by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist <b>in</b> only <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> (unilateral) or <b>in</b> both ears (bilateral). Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.|$|R
25|$|The bullet had severed an {{auditory}} nerve, {{leaving him}} deaf <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear,</b> {{and he has}} suffered from chronic pain from bullet fragments lodged in his brain. He was visited {{the day after the}} shooting by Mayor John V. Lindsay and Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy, and the police department harassed him with hourly bed checks. He later testified before the Knapp Commission.|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> {{is supposed to}} be shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear {{is supposed to be}} ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E
25|$|Although modern {{headphones}} {{have been}} particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since {{the release of the}} Walkman, there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard panned sounds will also only be heard only <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> rather than from one side.|$|E

25|$|On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey is suicidal. Prayers for him reach Heaven, where Clarence Odbody, Angel 2nd Class, is {{assigned}} to save George in order to earn his angel wings. To prepare, Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life. The first is in 1919, when 12-year-old George saves his younger brother Harry, who falls through the ice on a frozen pond, from drowning; George loses his hearing <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> as a result. While working after school at the local drug store, George sees that his employer, Mr. Gower, distraught over his son's death from the flu, has accidentally added poison to a child's prescription drug, and intervenes to stop it from causing harm.|$|E
25|$|By day 63, Horne was deaf <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear,</b> {{blind in}} one eye, his liver was failing, {{and he was}} in {{considerable}} pain. A meeting was arranged for day 66 at noon with his supporters to show him the documents that were being faxed through by the Home Office regarding offers the government might be willing to make. It was agreed that, if there was any substance to them, Horne would call off the strike. Early on the morning of 10 December 1998, the 66th day of his hunger strike, Horne was moved out of hospital and back to Full Sutton Prison. The Home Office said that, because he was refusing treatment, {{there was no need for}} him to be in hospital. By now, Horne was hallucinating and could no longer remember why he was on hunger strike.|$|E

50|$|Sudden {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (SSHL), {{commonly}} known as sudden deafness, occurs as an unexplained, rapid loss of hearing—usually <b>in</b> <b>one</b> ear—either at once or over several days.

500|$|Some {{experiments}} give subjects a [...] "distractor" [...] task {{to ensure}} that subjects are not consciously {{paying attention to the}} experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes attentional resources to it. [...] For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. [...] The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attentionor at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.|$|E
500|$|Marcus [...] "Mark" [...] Laurence Elwin Oliphant {{was born}} on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town, a suburb of Adelaide. His father was Harold George [...] "Baron" [...] Oliphant, a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and {{part-time}} lecturer in Economics with the Workers' Educational Association. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. He was named after Marcus Clarke, the Australian author, and Laurence Oliphant, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. He had four younger brothers, Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald. His parents were theosophists, and as such were opposed to eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy, after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm. He {{was found to be}} completely deaf <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and he needed glasses for severe astigmatism and short-sightedness.|$|E

She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small.

50|$|Nystagmus is very {{noticeable}} {{but rarely}} recognized. Nystagmus can be clinically investigated {{by using a}} number of non-invasive standard tests. The simplest one is the caloric reflex test, <b>in</b> which <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> canal is irrigated with warm or cold water or air. The temperature gradient provokes the stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal and the consequent nystagmus.Nystagmus is often very commonly present with Chiari malformation.|$|R
500|$|The NMEs Bob Woffinden wrote a notably {{unfavourable}} {{assessment of}} the Dark Horse album, in which he found [...] "Hari's on Tour" [...] to be [...] "an unevenly paced boogie thing that has George blowing most of his licks straightaway and Tom Scott coming on with a few quasi-Jnr. Walker bursts". Woffinden continued: [...] "Which, you feel, {{would not be a}} bad appetiser for the real meat to follow. Unfortunately, Hari's vegetarian." [...] In an equally unfavourable review of the album, Jim Miller of Rolling Stone dismissed the track as [...] "banal". Harrison biographer Alan Clayson refers to Hari's on Tour" [...] as [...] "an instrumental that went <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and out the other", while in , critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described it as sounding like [...] "a backing track from which the vocal line has mysteriously been deleted". Author Elliot Huntley acknowledges that the musicians [...] "performed brilliantly" [...] on the recording, but adds, [...] "unfortunately brilliant musicians alone do not a good song make".|$|E
500|$|... "The Sweet Escape" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary pop music critics. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as [...] "an irresistible [...] track, {{driven by a}} giddy 'wee-oh!' hook and supported by a nearly anthemic summertime chorus". John Murphy of musicOMH referred to [...] "The Sweet Escape" [...] as [...] "a lovely, summery bouncy pop song with a very infectious chorus". Murphy compared the song to Weezer's 2002 single [...] "Keep Fishin'", and Blenders Ben Sisario compared it {{to the work of}} The Beach Boys. Alex Miller from the NME compared the song to Madonna's early work but added that it sounded [...] "cringey and saccharine". Anna Britten from Yahoo! Music commented that it sounded like music from 1970, specifically that of soul group Chairmen of the Board. Bill Lamb of About.com called the song [...] "a welcome change from the over-produced 'Wind It Up'", but noted that it [...] "easily jets <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> and out the other leaving little trace of its presence". MuchMusic's video review program Video on Trial referred to the song as [...] "incredibly intoxicating".|$|E
500|$|In Europe, {{earrings}} {{for women}} fell from fashion generally between the 4th and 16th centuries, as styles in clothing and hair tended {{to obscure the}} ears, but they gradually thereafter came back into vogue in Italy, Spain, England and France—spreading as well to North America—until after World War I when piercing fell from favor and the newly invented Clip-on earring became fashionable. According to The Anatomie of Abuses by Philip Stubbs, earrings were even more common among men of the 16th century than women, while Raphael Holinshed in 1577 confirms the practice among [...] "lusty courtiers" [...] and [...] "gentlemen of courage." [...] Evidently originating in Spain, the practice of ear piercing among European men spread {{to the court of}} Henry III of France and then to Elizabethan era England, where earrings (typically worn <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>ear</b> only) were sported by such notables as Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles I of England. Common men wore earrings as well. From the European Middle Ages, a superstitious belief that piercing one ear improved long-distance vision led to the practice among sailors and explorers. Sailors also pierced their ears in the belief that their earrings could pay for a Christian burial if their bodies washed up on shore.|$|E
