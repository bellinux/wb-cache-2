40|$|From recent {{calls for}} {{positioning}} forensic scientists within {{the criminal justice}} system, but also policing and intelligence missions, this paper emphasizes {{the need for the}} development of educational and training programs in the area of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence,</b> It is argued that an imbalance exists between perceived and actual understanding of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> by police and forensic science managers, and that this imbalance can only be overcome through education. The challenge for <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> education and training is therefore to devise programs that increase <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> awareness, firstly for managers to help prevent poor decisions on how to develop information processing. Two recent European courses are presented as examples of education offerings, along with lessons learned and suggested paths forward. It is concluded that the new focus on <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> could restore a pro-active approach to forensic science, better quantify its efficiency and let it get more involved in investigative and managerial decisions. A new educational challenge is opened to forensic science university programs around the world: to refocus criminal trace analysis on a more holistic security problem solving approach...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we posit that current investigative techniques—particularly as {{deployed}} by law enforcement, are becoming unsuitable for most types of crime investigation. The growth in cybercrime and {{the complexities of}} the types of the cybercrime coupled with the limitations in time and resources, both computational and human, in addressing cybercrime put an increasing strain on the ability of digital investigators to apply the processes of digital forensics and digital investigations to obtain timely results. In order to combat the problems, {{there is a need to}} enhance the use of the resources available and move beyond the capabilities and constraints of the forensic tools that are in current use. We argue that more intelligent techniques are necessary and should be used proactively. The paper makes the case for the need for such tools and techniques, and investigates and discusses the opportunities afforded by applying principles and procedures of artificial <b>intelligence</b> to digital <b>forensics</b> <b>intelligence</b> and to intelligent forensics and suggests that by applying new techniques to digital investigations there is the opportunity to address the challenges of the larger and more complex domains in which cybercrimes are taking place...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{chorus of}} {{forensic}} professionals believe that forensic science has undersold its potential contribution to crime reduction {{and has a}} more significant {{role to play in}} policing, with collation and analysis of forensic information used to inform policing tactics, operations or strategy. Domestic law enforcement agencies, as producers, consumers and purveyors of forensic information and intelligence, are also responding to political pressures to expand and accelerate their technological abilities to gather and disseminate forensic information and intelligence within expanding operational boundaries. For example, {{there are a number of}} agreements that promise the automated exchange of forensic data internationally, in particular: fingerprints and DNA profiles, and many that share other law enforcement information via a variety of channels. However, there is yet to be any detailed consideration of the multi-faceted issues raised by the production of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and the impact of direct access and/or exchanges of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence.</b> While technologies are increasingly interoperable, traditional parameters restraining law enforcement information sharing are increasingly inadequate. The lack of oversight of the transnational flows of law enforcement information mean that current processes lack transparency and, consequently, citizens’ ability to know of, understand, and challenge exchanges of their data is almost non-existent. Yet the expectation is that the power to generate, gather, store and share <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> will be used with integrity. Integrity is essential for generalised trust among not just the direct consumers of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence,</b> but the public. For the integrity of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> to be maintained, critical attention must be paid not only to the viability of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> production and sharing, but also to its legitimacy and acceptability...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{relies on the}} expression of suitable models that better represent the contribution of <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{in relation to the}} criminal justice system, policing and security. Such models assist in comparing and evaluating methods and new technologies, provide transparency and foster the {{development of}} new applications. Interestingly, strong similarities between two separate projects focusing on specific forensic science areas were recently observed. These observations have led to the induction of a general model (Part I) that could guide the use of any forensic science case data in an intelligence perspective. The present article builds upon this general approach by focusing on decisional and organisational issues. The article investigates the comparison process and evaluation system that lay {{at the heart of the}} <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> framework, advocating scientific decision criteria and a structured but flexible and dynamic architecture. These building blocks are crucial and clearly lay within the expertise of forensic scientists. However, it is only part of the problem. <b>Forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> includes other blocks with their respective interactions, decision points and tensions (e. g. regarding how to guide detection and how to integrate forensic information with other information). Formalising these blocks identifies many questions and potential answers. Addressing these questions is essential for the progress of the discipline.

40|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> has {{recently}} gathered increasing attention {{as a potential}} expansion of forensic science that may contribute in a wider policing and security context. Whilst the new avenue is certainly promising, relatively few attempts to incorporate models, methods and techniques into practical projects are reported. This work reports a practical application of a generalised and transversal framework for developing <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> processes referred to here as the Transversal model adapted from previous work. Visual features present in the images of four datasets of false identity documents were systematically profiled and compared using image processing {{for the detection of}} a series of modus operandi (M. O.) actions. The nature of these series and their relation to the notion of common source was evaluated with respect to alternative known information and inferences drawn regarding respective crime systems. 439 documents seized by police and border guard authorities across 10 jurisdictions in Switzerland with known and unknown source level links formed the datasets for this study. Training sets were developed based on both known source level data, and visually supported relationships. Performance was evaluated through the use of intra-variability and inter-variability scores drawn from over 48, 000 comparisons. The optimised method exhibited significant sensitivity combined with strong specificity and demonstrates its ability to support <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> efforts...|$|E
40|$|Since 2008, Intelligence {{units of}} six {{states of the}} western part of Switzerland have been sharing a common {{database}} for the analysis of high volume crimes.

Several forensic outcomes are integrated in the system such as matches of traces with persons, and links between scenes detected by the comparison of forensic case data. Systematic procedures have been settled to integrate links assumed mainly through DNA profiles, shoemarks patterns and images. A statistical outlook on a retrospective dataset of series from 2009 to 2011 of the database informs for instance on the number of repetition detected or confirmed and increased by forensic case data. Time needed to obtain <b>forensic</b> <b>intelligence</b> in regard with the type of marks treated, is seen as a critical issue.

40|$|Today's {{approach}} to anti-doping is mostly {{centered on the}} judicial process, despite pursuing a further goal in the detection, reduction, solving and/or prevention of doping. Similarly to decision-making {{in the area of}} law enforcement feeding on <b>Forensic</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> anti-doping might significantly benefit from a more extensive gathering of knowledge. <b>Forensic</b> <b>Intelligence</b> might bring a broader logical dimension to the interpretation of data on doping activities for a more future-oriented and comprehensive approach instead of the traditional case-based and reactive process. Information coming {{from a variety of sources}} related to doping, whether directly or potentially, would feed an organized memory to provide real time intelligence on the size, seriousness and evolution of the phenomenon. Due to the complexity of doping, integrating analytical chemical results and longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers with physiological, epidemiological, sociological or circumstantial information might provide a logical framework enabling fit for purpose decision-making. Therefore, Anti-Doping Intelligence might prove efficient at providing a more proactive response to any potential or emerging doping phenomenon or to address existing problems with innovative actions or/and policies. This approach might prove useful to detect, neutralize, disrupt and/or prevent organized doping or the trafficking of doping agents, as well as helping to refine the targeting of athletes or teams. In addition, such an intelligence-led methodology would serve to address doping offenses in the absence of adverse analytical chemical evidence...|$|E

While networks of policing cooperation are not novel, their powers and capabilities have been growing {{in recent years and}} bilateral and multi-lateral agreements to exchange data between countries continue apace. With increasing demand for, and mechanisms enabling the extra-territorial exchange of evidence under mutual legal assistance, as well as direct law enforcement exchange of data there are increasing numbers of criminal investigations where evidence may have been collected, examined, or interpreted in a different country. Since the Prum Treaty of 2005, the exchange of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data (fingerprints) and vehicle registration data has become both automated, and mandatory across the EU. This exchange of evidence, highlights some of the wider issues raised by the exchange of scientific evidence for use in criminal proceedings undertaken in a different jurisdiction from that where the evidence emanated.
