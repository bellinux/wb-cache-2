500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue and <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E

You know the first time I heard it, I went bananas." [...] At Pat Field's Disco Party in New York, she told Universal Music Group executives [...] "I know in my gut that it felt good. Nobody could take my thoughts away from that. I doesn't need anyone else to tell me it's good". The song was released on May 17 and May 18, 2010 to the iTunes Stores, in France and the United States, respectively. The official extended dance remix was released alongside the main single on May 18, 2010. In the United Kingdom, [...] "Commander" [...] was planned for a June 28, 2010 release. Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower, smoother sound. American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix. It was released as part of the UK Remixes EP. as well as the second U.S. remixes EP. The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19, 2010 confirmed that [...] "Commander" [...] would serve only as the [...] "international lead single", leading to speculation another song would be released domestically. This speculation was confirmed when the Ne-Yo-penned, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off" [...] was set to impact on radio stations in the United States.

This admiration is best shown in Kusturica's Underground where the underwater scenes are very reminiscent of those from L'Atalante. Other films to pay tribute to L'Atalante include Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, Leos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, and Jean-Luc Godard's In Praise of Love.|$|E

2500|$|The Alcazar was rebuilt in {{the eighteenth}} century as the Royal Palace of Madrid, but the {{painting}} remained in the royal collection, and by 1794 had been moved to the [...] "Palacio Nuevo".

[...] He claimed that after he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Waterloo the previous year, the painting hung in the room where he convalesced in Brussels. [...] He <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and persuaded the owner to sell.

2500|$|Growing up in Barbados, she wasn't {{exposed to}} a lot of music, mainly reggae, hip-hop, and soca music.

[...] At the time of her debut, she {{recorded}} songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as [...] "a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R, with a little something different thrown in". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005), and its follow-up, A Girl like Me (2006). Music of the Sun demonstrates the influence of Rihanna’s musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, [...] "Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be". Her debut single, [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while [...] "If It's Lovin' that You Want" [...] talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her sophomore album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.|$|E

On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day.

2500|$|Musically, A Girl like Me reveals {{new types}} of musical genres {{compared}} to Rihanna's light and uptempo debut effort, Music of the Sun. Her goal on the album was to find songs that express the many things young women want to say, but might not know how. In an interview, Rihanna said: [...] "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] Reggae music, present in her debut album, subsequently continues into A Girl like Me. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different music genres, including rock music, while keeping the roots of her previous album, which where reggae and dancehall. The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some balladic elements. Although the album mostly follows the disco-ish mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae mash-up [...] "Kisses Don't Lie", though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence. In an interview, Rihanna commented: [...] "Growing up in Barbados, I wasn't exposed {{to a lot of}} rock music. We really love reggae and soca music and hip-hop. But when I moved to the United States last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I love rock music." [...] Celia SanMiguel of Vibe [...] magazine wrote that A Girl like Me is [...] "a pop album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's Caribbean roots", and that it [...] "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-R ambassador." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the album [...] "a record that almost identically" [...] veered between [...] "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", [...] "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and [...] "adult-oriented ballads".|$|E
