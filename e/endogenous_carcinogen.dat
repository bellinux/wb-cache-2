40|$|Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) {{is currently the}} most sensitive method for trace DNA adduct detection. O 6 -Mehtyldeoxyguanosine (O 6 -MedG) is a strongly mutagenic lesion formed {{by a variety of}} alkylating agents. For this reason this was the adduct of choice for use in this study, the aim of which was to develop a 14 C-postlabelling technique, involving incorporation of radiolabel onto O 6 -MedG adducts after isolation, thus enabling exploitation of AMS to detect low levels of adducts without the need to administer a 14 C-labelled compound. A method was developed and optimised for acetylating O 6 -MedG, in < 90 % yields. This method was then used to acetylate the adduct with 14 C-acetic anhydride, but changes required for the safe handling of radiolabelled compound altered the reaction product profile, resulting in the major derivative being 14 C-di-acetyl O 6 -MedG, (38 % yield). This pure standard was used to determine detection limits of 1. 4 pmoles of adduct using HPLC and liquid scintillation counting and 79 attomoles using AMS. A 3 H-O 6 MedG standard was used to determine the efficiency of each stage of the 14 C-postlabelling procedure. Overall assay efficiency was calculated to be 29 % and taking this into account the practical limit of detection for the 14 C-postlabelling procedure was calculated to be 272 attomoles of adduct. The assay was then utilised to quantitate O 6 -MedG adducts formed by exposure of DNA with MNU. The theoretical limit of detection was 3 adducts/ 1012 nucleosides, based on background 14 C levels in blank HPLC fractions, which indicates the assay should ultimately be the most sensitive for detection of endogenous O 6 -MedG adducts in control human DNA. The techniques developed for this assay were utilised to quantitate O 6 -MedG adducts formed in DNA exposed to 14 C-S-adenosylmethionine. Unfortunately no adducts were conclusively detected by AMS due to contamination of the samples, highlighting the problem of contamination in AMS analysis. However, with the addition of further purification steps, this assay could be sensitive enough to detect O 6 -MedG formed by the suspected <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogen...</b>|$|E
30|$|Unbalanced {{estrogen}} metabolism is {{a critical}} factor in cancer initiation. The discovery that specific oxidative metabolites of estrogens, the catechol estrogen quinones, react with DNA supports the hypothesis that estrogens can become <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> by generating the mutations leading to the initiation of cancer [11 – 14]. This paradigm indicates that specific, critical mutations produce abnormal cell proliferation leading to cancer, rather than ER-mediated abnormal cell proliferation that generates random mutations [1, 6 – 10]. The specificity of the critical mutations {{is the result of the}} preliminary intercalating physical complex between estrogen and DNA that occurs before formation of the covalent bond between them. This intercalating mechanism has been demonstrated for the human carcinogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) [15].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Endogenous estrogens can be bio-activated to <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> via {{formation}} of estrogen quinones. Estrogen- 3, 4 -quinones react with DNA to form mutagenic depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts. The carcinogenicity of endogenous estrogens {{is related to}} unbalanced estrogen metabolism leading to excess estrogen quinones and {{formation of}} depurinating DNA adducts. The present studies were initiated to confirm that relatively high levels of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts are present in women {{at high risk for}} breast cancer or diagnosed with the disease. These adducts may be biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer risk. The estrogen metabolites, conjugates and depurinating DNA adducts were identified and quantified by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urine samples from 40 healthy control women, 40 high-risk women and 40 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Estrogen metabolism was shifted from protective methoxylation and conjugation pathways in healthy control women towards activating pathways leading to formation of depurinating DNA adducts in women at high risk or with breast cancer. These results support the hypothesis that breast cancer is initiated by mutations derived from depurination of estrogen-DNA adducts. Therefore, relative levels of depurinating estrogen-DNA adducts could become biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer risk and aid in determining preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Various DNA {{alterations}} can {{be caused}} by exposure to environmental and <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogens.</b> Most of these alterations, if not repaired, can result in genetic instability, mutagenesis and cell death. DNA repair mechanisms are important for maintaining DNA integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. Recent lung cancer studies have focused on identifying the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, among which DNA repair genes are increasingly being studied. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to modulate DNA repair capacity and are suggested to be related to lung cancer risk. We identified a sufficient number of epidemiologic studies on lung cancer to conduct a meta-analysis for genetic polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes, focusing on xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC 1), ERCC 2 /XPD, ERCC 4 /XPF and ERCC 5 /XPG. We found an increased risk of lung cancer among subjects carrying the ERCC 2 751 Gln/Gln genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 14 - 1. 49). We found a protective effect of the XPA 23 G/G genotype (OR = 0. 75, 95 % CI = 0. 59 - 0. 95). Considering the data available, it can be conjectured that if there is any risk association between a single SNP and lung cancer, the risk fluctuation will probably be minimal.

40|$|The role of estrogens {{in breast}} and other cancers has been {{extensively}} investigated for many years, and historically most of these {{studies have focused on}} the hormonal regulation of cell proliferation. The most recent work in this area has focused on the expression of genes likely to mediate proliferation (e. g., growth factors, proto-oncogenes, etc.) and their regulation by the classic nuclear estrogen receptor, ER-�. In this chapter, we present a synopsis of several new developments in this area of ER-regulated gene expression. These developments include the following: 1) the selective activation of ER domains by partial estrogen antagonists, such as tamoxifen and other ligands; 2) the effects of ER-� overexpression and gene knockout on the development of breast and uterine cancers in experimental animal models; 3) mechanisms by which steroid hormones regulate programmed cell death, cell cycle progression, cell-substratum interactions, and genomic instability in cancer cells; 4) identification of nuclear proteins that interact with the ER in the presence of agonists and antagonists, the effect of ligand binding on the receptor structure, and the interactions of liganded and nonliganded receptors with coactivators, corepressors, and other regulatory proteins; and 5) the biochemical properties, cellular distribution, and potential biologic roles for the newly discovered ER-�. Although there is an increasing interest in understanding the role of estrogens as <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> it remains clear that ER-mediated regulation of gene expression plays many significant roles in normal and cancer cells, and increased knowledge of the mechanisms involved will improve our overall understanding of hormonal carcinogenesis.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Tat protein stimulates cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, displays angiogenic functions and {{is believed to be}} involved in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and other tumours arising in AIDS patients. Tat-transgenic (TT) mice, which constitutively express Tat in all tissues and organs, may therefore be predisposed to tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we treated TT mice with urethane, a general carcinogen inducing tumours of various organs. The results indicate that, after injection of urethane, the incidence of lung tumours and lymphomas is not significantly different in the TT and control (CC) mice, whereas liver preneoplastic lesions and tumours show a significantly greater incidence in TT than in CC mice. This remarkable carcinogenic effect of urethane for the liver may be due to a tat-induced predisposition, manifested as a liver cell dysplasia (LCD), spontaneously affecting most of the TT mice. LCD may exert a promoting effect by stimulating proliferation of cell clones initiated by the mutagenic effect of urethane. In addition, LCD, which is associated with aneuploidy and chromosome instability, may enhance the progression to malignancy of the preneoplastic lesions induced by urethane. Interestingly, a significantly greater incidence of vascular ectasias and haemangiomas was detected in the liver of urethane-treated TT mice, most likely due to the marked angiogenic properties of Tat. This study suggests a role for Tat in the promotion and progression of tumours initiated by exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>carcinogens</b> in HIV- 1 -infected patients, thereby contributing to the tumorigenesis in the course of AIDS...|$|R

For all 31 patients the total bile acids concentration was highly variable (8. 3 mg/ml- 106. 5 mg/ml). The median ratio of primary to secondary bile acids was 2. 7 : 1. The biliary bile acid ratios were similar in both control patients (3. 7 : 1) and those with colon cancer (3. 1 : 1), whereas patients with gall stones had significantly higher secondary bile acid levels in their biliary bile (ratio 1. 9 : 1, p = less than 0. 05).

It {{is very difficult to}} specifically detect trace DNA damage {{in the presence of a}} large excess of unmodified nucleosides. Here we report a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanocomposite, namely nanoMIP, which can be used as a "plastic antibody" for specific recognition of benzo[a] pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) -DNA adduct. Enhanced binding affinity (880 nM) of nanoMIPs was achieved by using two tailor-made functional monomers. The property of binding kinetics was greatly improved in virtue of the well-defined nanostructure, which was fabricated by initiators for continuous activator regeneration-atom transfer radical polymerization (ICAR-ATRP). The BPDE-adducted DNA can be specifically captured by synthetic nanoMIP. By taking advantage of this antibody-mimicking behavior, we further developed a fluorescently imaged particle counting immunoassay (FIPCIA) method for ultrasensitive detection of BPDE-ssDNA adducts using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). The number of countable fluorescent dots is proportional to the content of BPDE-ssDNA adducts in the DNA sample. The proposed plastic antibody-based FIPCIA method can detect traces of BPDE-DNA adducts as low as 18 pM in human lung carcinoma A 549 cells.

Recent studies demonstrate the inverse relationship between DNA repair capacity and efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapeutics: increased DNA repair capacity leads to resistance, while decreased capacity leads to increased sensitivities. Cisplatin's cytotoxic effects are mediated by formation of intrastrand DNA crosslinks, which are predominantly repaired via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.

To test if TT mice are predisposed to liver carcinogenesis, we treated them with diethylnitrosamine, a hepatotropic carcinogen. Diethylnitrosamine-treated TT mice developed both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the liver. They showed an enhancement of LCD and developed basophilic liver cell nodules (BLCN), hepatocellular adenomas (HA), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HC). Both preneoplastic (LCD and BLCN) and neoplastic (HA and HC) lesions were significantly more frequent in TT than in control mice: 29. 7 % versus 12. 7 % for LCD, 57. 9 % versus 23. 3 % for BLCN, 40. 6 % versus 10. 0 % for HA, and 50. 0 % versus 12. 7 % for HC.

Increasing lines of evidence show that the Keap 1 –Nrf 2 complex is a key molecular target of chemopreventive phase 2 enzyme inducers. The transcription factor Nrf 2 {{is a member of}} the basic leucine-zipper NF-E 2 family and interacts with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. A cytoplasmic actin-binding protein, Keap 1, is an inhibitor of Nrf 2 that sequesters it in the cytoplasm. Inducers dissociate this complex, allowing Nrf 2 to translocate to the nucleus. Disruption of the nrf 2 gene in mice leads to the loss of chemopreventive efficacy by inducers. This review focuses on (1) the role of Nrf 2 in the regulation of phase 2 and antioxidative genes, (2) the molecular actions of dithiolethiones on the Keap 1 –Nrf 2 pathway, and (3) the contribution of Nrf 2 -regulated gene families to the cytoprotective actions of dithiolethiones and other inducers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS : This case control study was undertaken {{over a period of}} 24 months and included 103 prostate cancer patients and 117 controls; both patients and controls originated from northern part of India. The GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 genotypes were identified by multiplex PCR in peripheral blood DNA samples.

RESULTS : Frequencies of null genotypes in GSTT 1 and GSTM 1, was 11 &#x 0025; (13 / 117) and 30 &#x 0025; (35 / 117) respectively in control individuals.

40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are an {{important}} part of the cellular detoxification system and, perhaps, evolved to protect cells against reactive oxygen metabolites. Theta is considered the most ancient among the GSTs and theta-like GSTs are found in mammals, fish, insects, plants, unicellular algae, and bacteria. It is thought that an ancestral theta-gene underwent an early duplication before the divergence of fungi and animals and further duplications generated the variety of the other classes of GSTs (alpha, mu, phi, etc.). The comparison of the aminoacidic homologies among mammals suggests that a duplication of an ancient GST theta occurred before the speciation of mammals and resulted in the subunits GSTT 1 and GSTT 2. The ancestral GST theta has a dehalogenase activity towards several halogenated compounds, such as the dichloromethane. In fact, some aerobic and anaerobic methylotrophic bacteria can use these molecules as the sole carbon and energy source. The mammalian GST theta cannot sustain the growth of bacteria but still retains the dehalogenating activity. Therefore, although mammalian GST theta behaves as a scavenger towards electrophiles, such as epoxides, it acts also as metabolic activator for halogenated compounds, producing a variety of intermediates potentially dangerous for DNA and cells. For example, mice exposed to dichloromethane show a dose-dependent incidence of cancer via the GSTT 1 - 1 pathway. Because GSTT 1 - 1 is polymorphic in humans, with about 20 % of Caucasians and 80 % of Asians lacking the enzyme, the relationship between the phenotype and the incidence of cancer has been investigated extensively in order to detect GSTT 1 - 1 -associated differential susceptibility towards <b>endogenous</b> or exogenous <b>carcinogens.</b> The lack of the enzyme is related to a slightly increased risk of cancer of the bladder, gastro-intestinal tract, and for tobacco-related tumors (lung or oral cavity). More pronounced risks were found in males with the GSTT 1 -null genotype for brain diseases and skin basal cell carcinomas not related to sunlight exposures. Moreover, there was an increased risk of kidney and liver tumors in humans with the GSTT 1 - 1 positive genotype following exposures to halogenated solvents. Interestingly, the liver and kidney are two organs that express the highest level of GST theta in the human body. Thus, the GSTT 1 - 1 genotype is suspected to confer decreased or increased risk of cancer in relation to the source of exposure; in vitro studies, mostly conducted on metabolites of butadiene, confirm the protective action of GSTT 1 - 1, whereas, thus far, experimental studies prove that the increasing risk is limited...|$|R
