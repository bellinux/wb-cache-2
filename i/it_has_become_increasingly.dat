5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of}} the Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E

25|$|With {{the closing}} of these state mental {{institutions}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult for {{people who suffer from}} severe mental illness to receive treatment in a facility. Many mentally ill individuals were left homeless after deinstitutionalization, making up one-third of the homeless population (D.E. Torrey). Today the most prominent treatment for the severely mentally ill is incarceration in a correctional facility, where mentally ill individuals are not receiving adequate care for their disorder.|$|E

50|$|Although the Sierra Leone People's Party {{had won the}} {{previous}} elections in 1962, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> unpopular, {{in part due to}} Albert Margai's unsuccessful attempts to convert the country into a one-party state, accusations of corruption, and an attempt to prevent opposition parties running against him and three other SLPP candidates.|$|R
25|$|The {{osmolality}} of {{the contrast}} agent was previously {{believed to be}} an important factor in contrast-induced nephropathy. Today <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> clear that other physicochemical properties play a greater role, such as viscosity. Attention should be paid to using contrast agents of low viscosity. Moreover, sufficient fluids should be supplied to limit fluid viscosity of urine. Modern iodinated contrast agents are non-ionic, the older ionic types caused more adverse effects, and their use has diminished.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{procedures}} {{also included}} {{the manner in}} which the work of paramedics was overseen and managed. In the early days medical control and oversight was direct and immediate, with paramedics calling into a local hospital and receiving orders for every individual procedure or drug. While this still occurs in some jurisdictions, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> rare. Day-to-day operations largely moved from direct and immediate medical control to pre-written protocols or standing orders, with the paramedic typically seeking advice after the options in the standing orders had been exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Professionals, {{those who}} have a college education, and those whose work {{revolves}} around the conceptualization of ideas have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} {{apparently}} introduced by John Calvin (1509-1564) in 1544 in his Excuse à messieurs les Nicodemites. [...] Since the French monarchy had increased its prosecution of heresy with the Edict of Fontainebleau (1540), <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> dangerous to profess dissident belief publicly, and refuge was being sought in emulating Nicodemus.|$|R
50|$|The synagogue {{continued}} to function until January 1973. By that time <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult to obtain}} a minyan for services and the remaining members decided to vote the community out of existence. One Sefer Torah which had been borrowed from Birmingham in 1940 was returned to its owners, while a second one was donated to a new Israeli community.|$|R
5000|$|The 8th {{had long}} been a classic [...] "Yellow Dog" [...] Democrat district. Most state and local {{officials}} were Democrats, and congressional elections usually saw Democrats skate to reelection. However, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> friendly to Republicans at the national level {{since the turn of the}} 21st century. In the 2008 presidential election, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain carried the district with 56% of the vote.|$|R
25|$|As is {{customary}} at German universities, {{students are}} generally required {{to arrange for}} their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however {{a large majority of}} students share private flats with a couple of other students (German: Wohngemeinschaft, abbreviated WG), or live in single apartments. In recent years, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into buying behavior (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E
25|$|From human {{clinical}} trials, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{evident that}} a more effective focus of treatment is slowing, stopping and even partially reversing the atheroma growth process. There are several prospective epidemiologic studies including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which have supported a direct correlation of Carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT) with myocardial infarction and stroke risk in patients without cardiovascular disease history. The ARIC Study was conducted in 15,792 individuals between 5 and 65 years of age in four {{different regions of the}} US between 1987 and 1989. The baseline CIMT was measured and measurements were repeated at 4- to 7-year intervals by carotid B mode ultrasonography in this study. An increase in CIMT was correlated with an increased risk for CAD. The CHS was initiated in 1988, and the relationship of CIMT with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was investigated in 4,476 subjects ≤65 years of age. At the end of approximately six years of follow-up, CIMT measurements were correlated with cardiovascular events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} to suggest that DNA damage, as {{distinct}} from mutation, is {{the primary cause of}} aging was Alexander in 1967.

The central idea is that from the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old Carolingian heartlands in northern France and western Germany were spreading to outlying areas, creating a more recognisable [...] "Europe". Scotland was just one of many [...] "outlying" [...] areas.|$|E

In 2005, Rita was built (then called Rita: Queen of Speed), as well as there being several other changes to the park.

2500|$|Acoustic {{amplifiers}} {{produce an}} uncolored, [...] "acoustic" [...] sound when used with acoustic instruments with built-in transducer pickups or microphones. The amplifiers often {{come with a}} simple mixer, so that the signals from a pickup and condenser microphone can be blended. Since the early 2000s, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for acoustic amplifiers to provide a range of digital effects, such as reverb and compression. As well, these amplifiers often contain feedback-suppressing devices, such as notch filters or parametric equalizers.|$|E

2500|$|Radio {{broadcasting}} of Christmas {{music has}} been around for several decades in the United States and elsewhere. Traditionally, U.S. radio stations (particularly those with such formats as adult contemporary, adult standards, easy listening, oldies, or beautiful music) began adding some Christmas-themed selections to their regular playlists shortly after Thanksgiving each year, typically culminating in 36–48 hours of continuous Christmas music between December 24–25. Since the mid-1990s, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for stations to switch their programming to continuous Christmas music around Thanksgiving, or earlier. This practice became even more widespread after 9/11, when many radio stations across the U.S. sought a sort of musical [...] "comfort food".|$|E

"In the {{intervening}} years <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> clear that the tragedy of a Scottsboro lies, not in the bitterly cruel injustice which it works upon its immediate victims, but also, and perhaps even more, in the cynical use of human misery by Communists in propagandizing Communism, and in the complacency with which a democratic government views the basic evils from which such a case arises. A majority of Americans still ignore, the plain implications in similar tragedies." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1889, {{the city}} of Decatur was the largest city in North Alabama, out-sizing Huntsville. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{apparent}} {{that the city was}} in need of a theater to showcase its fine arts. The Opera House was built on a 100 by 140 foot site that ran south from Johnston Street and fronting {{on the east side of}} 1st Avenue.

500|$|Feyerabend {{said that}} science {{started as a}} {{liberating}} movement, but that over time <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> an ideology. Because of this, {{he said it was}} impossible {{to come up with an}} unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythology. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as authoritarian and ungrounded. Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of [...] "the worst enemy of science" [...] from his detractors.|$|R
2500|$|The first mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} to be {{discovered}} was ERK1 (MAPK3) in mammals. Since ERK1 and its close relative ERK2 (MAPK1) are both involved in growth factor signaling, the family was termed [...] "mitogen-activated". With the discovery of other members, even from distant organisms (e.g. plants), <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> clear that the name is a misnomer, since most MAPKs are actually involved in the response to potentially harmful, abiotic stress stimuli (hyperosmosis, oxidative stress, DNA damage, low osmolarity, infection, etc.). Because plants cannot [...] "flee" [...] from stress, terrestrial plants have {{the highest number of}} MAPK genes per organism ever found. Thus the role of mammalian ERK1/2 kinases as regulators of cell proliferation is not a generic, but a highly specialized function.|$|E
2500|$|The {{canonicity}} of the spin-off {{media with}} respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation (the [...] "Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who" [...] on the BBC's classic Doctor Who website suggests {{this may be due to}} the Time War). It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama Zagreus. In response, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common to consider the three ranges separately. The final Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, The Gallifrey Chronicles, obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the Ninth Doctor (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). Mary's Story, a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In The Night of the Doctor, the Doctor [...] "salutes" [...] five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the primary purpose of CSR is to provide {{legitimacy}} to the power of businesses. As wealth inequality is perceived to be increasing <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> necessary for businesses to justify their position of power. Bakan {{is one of the most}} prominent critics of the conflict of interest between private profit and public good, and his argument is summarised by Haynes that [...] "a corporate calculus exists in which costs are pushed onto both workers, consumers and the environment". CSR spending may be seen in these financial terms, whereby the higher costs of socially undesirable behaviour are offset by a CSR spending of a lower amount. Indeed, it has been argued that there is a [...] "halo effect" [...] in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms which had been convicted of bribery in the USA under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a 20% increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue, such as child labour, was equated to a 40% lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{protecting}} nature for nature's sake began {{to gain more}} recognition in the 1930s with American writers like Aldo Leopold, calling for a [...] "land ethic" [...] and urging wilderness protection. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to deep ecology; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.|$|R

The race galvanized Democrats across the nation, who said Chambliss had questioned the patriotism of Cleland, a disabled Vietnam veteran. Miller remained true to the Democrats in this case, campaigning hard for Cleland despite their ideological differences. But after Chambliss won, Miller formed a close working relationship with him. He also moved even further to the right, presumably because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult for a Democrat to win statewide in Georgia.|$|R
