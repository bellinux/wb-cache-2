6000|$|By {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} the leaves, their degree of complication, and their rudimentary parts in the six genera, we are led to infer that their common parent form partook of the characters of Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis. The leaves of this ancient form were almost certainly linear, perhaps divided, and bore on their upper and lower surfaces glands which had the power of secreting and absorbing. Some of these glands were mounted on pedicels, and others were almost sessile; the latter secreting only when stimulated by the absorption of nitrogenous matter. In Byblis the glands consist of a single layer of cells, supported on a unicellular pedicel; in Roridula they have a more complex structure, and are supported on pedicels formed of several rows of cells; in Drosophyllum they further include spiral cells, and the pedicels include a bundle of spiral vessels. But in these three genera these organs do not possess any power of movement, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt that they are of the nature of hairs or trichomes. Although in innumerable instances foliar organs move when excited, no case is known of a trichome having such [page 359] power.* We are thus led to inquire how the so-called tentacles of Drosera, which are manifestly of the same general nature as the glandular hairs of the above three genera, could have acquired the power of moving. Many botanists maintain that these tentacles consist of prolongations of the leaf, because they include vascular tissue, but this can no longer be considered as a trustworthy distinction. The possession of the power of movement on excitement would have been safer evidence. But when we consider the vast number of the tentacles on both surfaces of the leaves of Drosophyllum, and on the upper surface of the leaves of Drosera, it seems scarcely possible that each tentacle could have aboriginally existed as a prolongation of the leaf. Roridula, perhaps, shows us how we may reconcile these difficulties with respect to the homological nature of the tentacles. The lateral divisions of the leaves of this plant terminate in long tentacles; and these include spiral vessels which extend for only a short distance up them, with no line of demarcation between what is plainly the prolongation of the leaf and the pedicel of a <b>glandular</b> <b>hair.</b> Therefore there would be nothing anomalous or unusual in the basal parts of these tentacles, which correspond with the marginal ones of Drosera, acquiring the power of movement; and we know that in Drosera it is only the lower part which becomes inflected. But in order to understand how in this latter genus not only the marginal but all the inner tentacles have become capable of movement, we must further assume, either that through the principle of correlated development this ...|$|E

50|$|The salt glands of {{mangroves}} such as Acanthus, Aegiceras, Aegialitis and Avicennia are {{a distinctive}} multicellular trichome, a <b>glandular</b> <b>hair</b> {{found on the}} upper leaf surface and much more densely in the abaxial indumentum.

The salt gland continues to develop to produce two to four vacuolated cells {{at the level of the}} epidermis, the stalk cell with an almost completely cutinized wall, and at least eight terminal cells. The terminal cells have a thin, perforated cuticle which separates from the cell walls apically, leaving an enclosed cavity between them. The secreted salt evaporates and forms visible crystals.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted to evaluate glandular-haired perennial Medicago species as potential germplasm sources for alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica (Gyllenhal)) resistance. M. prostrata and M. glandulosa had the highest degree {{of resistance to the}} weevil, while M. glutinosa had intermediate resistance. Larval development studies indicated that perennial diploids M. prostrata and M. glandulosa were highly resistant, and were comparable with a resistant annual M. disciformis. Number of eggs oviposited into stems of M. prostrata and M. glandulosa was low in both free-choice and no-choice tests. In the no-choice test, oviposition was higher in susceptible M. sativa (alfalfa) than in perennial tetraploid M. glutinosa, however, no difference between these entries was evident in the free-choice test. In feeding tests, dry matter consumption, leaf damage ratings, and numbers of weevils on the entries were all lower for M. prostrata and M. glandulosa than for susceptible M. sativa. M. glutinosa {{did not appear to be}} consistently resistant to adult weevil feeding. Adult feeding damage ratings, leaf dry matter consumption, and oviposition did not vary with <b>glandular</b> <b>hair</b> density on the stems of M. glutinosa. The relative number of adults present on M. glutinosa did vary inversely with <b>glandular</b> <b>hair</b> density on stems. Weevil oviposition appeared to be associated with stem toughness, with fewest eggs deposited into relatively tough stems of M. prostrata and progeny of M. prostrate x M. sativa (diploid) crosses. Oviposition was highest into the least tough stems of tetraploid M. sativa. A field study compared weevil abundance and damage on four perennial, glandular-haired lines and four commercial cultivars. The glandular-haired M. glandulosa entry tended to have the lowest number of larvae and the least stem tip damage, when differences were indicated among entries. The M. prostrata x M. sativa cross progeny had moderate damage similar to the commercial cultivar 2 ̆ 7 Team 2 ̆ 7 and to the M. glandulosa entry on one sample data. M. glandulosa had the shortest growth habit while the commercial cultivars were taller than the remaining glandular-haired entries. ...|$|E
40|$|Plants of Origanum vulgare L. ssp. vulgare {{from the}} Veneto region (NE Italy) were {{selected}} to study the variability of the essential-oil composition from leaves and inflorescences throughout an elevation gradient.

Since glandular trichomes are prerequisite for the essential-oil synthesis, the second objective was to establish whether its production is related to <b>glandular</b> <b>hair</b> number, and density. Essential-oil contents decline with increasing altitude, and the micromorphological observations revealed a decrease in trichome density along the same direction. Moreover, GC/MS analysis together with principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the three investigated populations were significantly different in chemical composition. Therefore, an important interpopulation variability for low-, mid-, and high-altitude sites was established, suggesting the likely occurrence of different biotypes associated with altitudinal levels. Hence, the involvement of abiotic factors such as temperature and drought in the chemical polymorphism of O. vulgare associated with elevation is briefly discussed...|$|E
