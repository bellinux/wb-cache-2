500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also wondered if she might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E

No woman, by contrast, agreed to such propositions from men of average attractiveness. While men were in general comfortable with the requests, regardless of their willingness ("Why do we have to wait until tonight?", [...] ", I'm married"), women responded with shock and disgust ("You've got to be kidding", [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> Leave me alone").|$|E

5000|$|Besides its {{commercial}} success, [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] {{had a big}} impact on blues and R&B musicians. B.B. King, who was a disc jockey at Memphis, Tennessee, radio station WDIA at the time, regularly featured Hooker's song. He recalled: [...] was hardly anybody around who was playing at that time didn't play 'Boogie Chillen.' That's just how heavy it was ... I, for one, and many others musicians who would go out and play—if you didn't play 'Boogie Chillen' at that time, people probably look at you and wonder what <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> It <b>was</b> such a big record. Murray likens the song to [...] "the R&B equivalent of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple enough not to intimidate beginners. It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,' ... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' I mean John Lee's got a hell of a style". In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} {{are excerpts from}} Elder Mason's personal testimony regarding his receiving the Holy Ghost. [...] "The first day in the meeting I sat to myself, away from those that went with me. I began to thank God in my heart for all things, for when I heard some speak in tongues, I knew it was right though I did not understand it. Nevertheless, it was sweet to me.I also thank God for Elder Seymour who came and preached a wonderful sermon. His words were sweet and powerful and it seems that I hear them now while writing. When he closed his sermon, he said 'All of those that want to be sanctified or baptized with the Holy Ghost, go to the upper room; and all those that want to be justified, come to the altar.'I said that is the place for me, for it may be that I am not converted and if not, God knows it and can convert me...""Glory!""The second night of prayer I saw a vision. I saw myself standing alone and had a dry roll of paper in my mouth trying to swallow it. Looking up towards the heavens, there appeared a man at my side. I turned my eyes at once, then I awoke and the interpretation came.God had me swallowing the whole book and if I did not turn my eyes to anyone but God and Him only, He would baptize me. I said yes to Him, and at once in the morning when I arose, I could hear a voice in me saying, [...] "I see...""I got a place at the altar and began to thank God. After that, I said Lord if I could only baptize myself, I would do so; for I wanted the baptism so bad I {{did not know what to}} do. I said, Lord, You will have to do the work for me; so I turned it over into His hands.""Then, I began to ask for the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Acts 2:4, [...] "All were filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to express themselves in foreign tongues and make bold proclamation as the Spirit prompted them"and Acts 2:41"Then they that gladly received His word were baptized," [...] Then I saw that I had a right to be glad and not sad.""The enemy said to me, there may <b>be</b> something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Then a voice spoke to me saying, if there <b>is</b> anything <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Christ will find it and take it away and marry you...Someone said, 'Let us sing.' I arose and the first song that came to me was 'He brought me out of the Miry Clay.' O Glory Hallelujah! Praise His most wonderful name!The Spirit came upon the saints and upon me...Then I gave up for the Lord to have His way within me. So there came a wave of Glory into me and all of my being was filled with the Glory of the Lord.So when He had gotten me straight on my feet, there came a light which enveloped my entire being above the brightness of the sun. When I opened my mouth to say Glory, a flame touched my tongue which ran down me. My language changed and no word could I speak in my own tongue. Oh! I was filled with the Glory of the Lord. My soul was then satisfied.|$|R

Lead singer Enright strutted {{the stage in}} one of two sets of brightly colored feathered wings, and the audience often had the opportunity to share in the fun, as described on Lanarama's Bizarre Stage Antics: “Scatterheart had a feather cannon that would shoot feathers out over the crowd at their album release party” Scatterheart publicist Cristy Laubman, in conversation with Georgia Straight writer Adrian Mack speculated that the man might actually use his wings to fly. Ronatron {{had this to say about}} the group's performance at a legendary Vancouver venue: [...] "After the bricks have fallen and the lights turned off, I want to take a moment and step back in time and relive one of the best shows I have ever been to at Richard’s on Richards[...] [...] on that normal night, when no one actually believed that this venue was actually going to torn down, a local band by the name of Scatterheart utterly blew my mind with their amazing showmanship and tight instrumentals. I can honestly say that this was one of the best shows I have ever witnessed at Richard’s on Richards." [...] Regarding an earlier performance, Cordmag stated: [...] "This was the highlight of the festival so far. Scatterheart made it worth it if nothing else." [...] Spun concedes: [...] "If you weren't dripping in loverockrevolution by the end, there <b>is</b> something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Scatterheart <b>is</b> a positive, high energy, rock n roll show that DEMANDS you be entertained." [...] With regards to international performance, the challenges of performing at a festival halfway around the globe are defined thus: [...] "Fury mentioned that learning to say “Scatterheart loves you!” in Korean was the first order of business, along with a couple of radio and TV interviews." [...] Rob Michaels of Mountain 102.1 FM Radio in Whistler/Squamish, B.C., became a Scatterheart fan after hearing the group at the 2009 Telus World Ski and Snowboard event http://wssf.com/. Intrigued by the sight of a man wandering around Whistler wearing multi-colored feathers, Rob later invited the group to his studio for both an extensive interview and an acoustic performance of the song Beautiful. Scatterheart guitarist Doug Fury regaled Michaels with stories of the group's festival experience in Busan, Korea: the initial ecstatic reaction of the crowd of 25,000 as the group came out on the stage led Doug to comment to Mike, Jesse, and Wes that “Dudes, this is going to go off!” and, later, to note that a crowd of that size felt “just about right!” During the interview, Rob also reminded his listening audience about the upcoming First Night 2010 http://www.whistlerfirstnight.com/ show in the outdoor stadium at Whistler Olympic Park, at which Scatterheart was a featured group.|$|R
