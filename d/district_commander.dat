5|$|The {{relationship}} between the North Caucasus Military <b>District</b> <b>commander</b> {{and the air force}} and their roles in commanding were unclear. Colonel-General Aleksandr Zelin, commander-in-chief of the Air Force did not set foot in the command post, instead running Air-force operations on a mobile phone from his office without any help from his air-defence assistants. The air force was accused of rendering no assistance to land campaign.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an afloat unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half). In 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R. Castillo became the first Hispanic-American <b>district</b> <b>commander</b> in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after he}} had taken office Meyszner clashed with Kaltenbrunner, {{requiring}} {{the intervention of the}} Chief of the Orpo, SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei Kurt Daluege. Meyszner was transferred to the Sudetenland in early October 1938, after its annexation by Germany, as an Orpo <b>district</b> <b>commander.</b> On 20 April 1939, he was promoted to Generalmajor der Ordnungspolizei. In June 1939, he was again transferred, this time to Kassel, as Inspector of Orpo for the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. He remained in this role until 10 September 1940, during which time he was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer on 20 April 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 16:00 on 16 September; {{by the second}} day, JNA 9th (Knin) Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vuković modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police (who relied on populated areas and terrain features {{to hold back the}} JNA). Vuković's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj, resting the remainder of the attacking force. These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military-Maritime <b>District</b> <b>commander,</b> Vice Admiral Mile Kandić. The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September, further isolating Zadar, and the city's electricity supply was cut {{on the first day of}} the JNA attack. The ZNG was driven out of Polača, towards Škabrnja, on 18 September. Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar, the most significant the Turske kuće barracks and depot. The captures provided the ZNG with about 2,500 rifles, 100 M-53 machine guns and ammunition, although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons. The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence, but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate; Croatian forces were spread too thin to defend the city and capture the remaining barracks, and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out.|$|E
25|$|During the Allied {{operations}} in Norway following the German surrender in May 1945, Bruun was deployed to Naval Command Mid-Norway as a <b>district</b> <b>commander,</b> based in Ålesund. He held this position until May 1946.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from the}} National Police Headquarters, all the {{regional}} divisions have subdivisions under them. The {{aim of this}} is to decentralize the activities of the regional police force for more effective and flexible policing. Each regional command is divided into divisional commands. The various divisional commands are headed by Divisional Commanders, who are in charge of the district commands under them. The individual district commands are, in turn, headed by <b>District</b> <b>Commanders.</b> The <b>District</b> <b>Commanders</b> have direct control and supervisory responsibilities over all police stations and posts under their jurisdiction.|$|R

25|$|The District was {{originally}} established on 4 May 1918, and reorganised {{as a field}} formation during the Russian Civil War. The First Cavalry Army was formed in the District in November 1919. The District was reformed in the early 1920s with its headquarters at Rostov. Kliment Voroshilov was made <b>district</b> <b>commander.</b> During the 1920s and 1930s the District became home to many training establishments, which were to multiply greatly during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, the General {{was again}} ordered to foreign shore duty, {{this time to}} the Dominican Republic where he was {{assigned}} duty with the Guardia Nacional Dominicans, as <b>District</b> <b>Commander</b> of Santo Domingo (then Ciudad Trujillo). He returned to the United States in 1921, and in December of that year was assigned as Commanding Officer, 77th Machine Gun Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia. In October 1922, he {{was transferred to the}} Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., where he served as adjutant and other related duties.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Gurion's plan didn't work. In {{the course}} of a meeting with Revisionist party member Yaakov Chinsky, Ben Ami told him that Haganah knew the kidnapped {{soldiers}} were being imprisoned under Banai's house. Chinsky, who knew the information was wrong, passed it to Avraham Assaf, the Irgun's <b>district</b> <b>commander</b> in the Netanya area. Assaf knew the hostages were not in Banai's cellar, but it did contain the equipment used in the kidnapping, and he thought its discovery might assist the British in finding the kidnappers or their hostages. He therefore arranged to have the evidence removed.|$|E
25|$|<b>District</b> <b>Commanders</b> {{hold the}} rank of Superintendent, as do sworn National Managers, the road {{policing}} manager in the Waitemata District, responsible for the motorway network and traffic alcohol group, and the commandant of the Royal New Zealand Police College. Area Commanders hold {{the rank of}} Inspector as do Shift Commanders based {{in each of the}} three Communications Centres. <b>District</b> Section <b>Commanders</b> are typically Senior Sergeants.|$|R

25|$|The next day, 18 April, HNoMS Stegg was {{despatched}} to Langenuen in Austevoll {{to intercept}} four merchant ships, leaving Sæl {{alone in the}} area. Soon afterwards, an alarm went out in Uskedal warning that three German E-boat fast attack craft were entering the Hardangerfjord. In response, <b>district</b> <b>commander</b> Orlogskaptein (Lieutenant Commander) Ulstrup – the former commander of the mine layer Tyr – gave an oral order that Sæl was to avoid contact with the superior enemy force. Ulstrup felt that the poorly armed, slow and not very manoeuvrable Sæl would not {{stand a chance against}} the three fast and modern opponents.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Army {{still exists}} today, with {{headquarters}} at Ussuriysk, but has seen much reorganisation and reductions. On 29 November 2000 the then Far East Military <b>District</b> <b>commander,</b> General Colonel Yuri Yakubov, {{was reported in}} Vremya Novostei as saying that only 'four fully staffed operational regiments and several operational divisions' in the district were combat ready. In addition, the last exercise for reserve divisions was run in 1985. One regiment at Yekaterinoslavka was reported in October 1999 as being the only 100% manned regiment in 35th Army, {{so it could be}} guessed that during the 1999–2000 time period the remaining three full-strength regiments were with the 5th Army.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Admiral Morrison {{replaced}} Admiral Prins as <b>District</b> <b>Commander</b> and Lieutenant Mark O'Hare replaced Lieutenant Boyer as Admiral's Aide. The {{change of}} command was favorable toward Marlett's cartoons, {{except for one}} incident: Marlett created a storyboard that poked fun at a recent district inspection that the admiral planned and managed. Admiral Morrison called Marlett to his office and made it clear how offended {{he was with the}} cartoon. Marlett apologized to the admiral and the offending storyboard was replaced with another idea. After the uncomfortable situation with the admiral, Lieutenant O'Hare became more vigilant and required Marlett to have future storyboards meet his approval before turning the sketches into original artwork.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, African-American {{officers}} {{founded the}} Vanguard Justice Society, {{to represent their}} rights and interests. Throughout the 1970s, more African Americans advanced in the department; Black officers were promoted to positions of <b>district</b> <b>commanders</b> and chief of patrol.|$|R
50|$|The Enforcement Division {{has both}} uniformed patrol deputies and plain clothes deputies {{working in the}} {{following}} assigned units: Patrol, Investigation, Traffic, Civil Process, D.A.R.E./SRO, Explorers, and D.O.V.E. The South and North <b>District</b> <b>Commanders</b> oversee the day to day operation of Patrol, Investigations, School Resource Officers, Civil Process and the Traffic Unit. In order to better manage operations the South and North <b>District</b> <b>Commanders</b> split supervision duties based on geographic location. The dividing line for this is Interstate 70. Deputies have jurisdiction for the entire county of Boone. This includes any town within Boone County {{that does not have}} a police department. Deputies have powers of arrest in all municipalities and townships within Boone County.|$|R
25|$|The Steppe Military District {{was formed}} {{for a second}} time postwar when the {{territory}} of the Central Asian Military District was divided between the Steppe and Turkestan Military Districts on 9 July 1945. The district headquarters was formed from the 4th Shock Army headquarters at Alma-Ata, and its only commander was former Central Asian Military <b>District</b> <b>commander</b> Lieutenant General Pavel Kurbatkin. It controlled troops on the territory of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, excluding Aktobe, Guryev, and West Kazakhstan Oblasts. The district disbanded reserve and training units and demobilized combat units withdrawn to the district. On 4 February 1946 it became a territorial military district and was subordinated to the Turkestan Military District. Its headquarters was disbanded on 3 May.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{reinforcements}} {{were deployed}} to PRT Kunduz, almost doubling the garrison there. The security situation had turned notably worse. All girl schools in Chardara {{had to be}} closed for fear of imminent terrorist attacks. Manpower shortages did not allow German forces to uphold a permanent deterrence against armed militias, crippling the long-term effect of their actions. However, German and Afghan troops increased their efforts {{to take on the}} Taliban in different operations of various character. On May 15, ANSF killed Qari Sidiqulla, a Taliban <b>district</b> <b>commander</b> for Imam Sahib, in Imam Sahib's Sharawan region. Three of his fighters were also killed. In the same week, the Taliban tried to assassinate Mohammad Omar, the Governor of Kunduz. He and his bodyguard were slightly wounded. On July 1, four ANSF personnel were killed in Chahardara.|$|E
25|$|In February 1648 Colonel John Poyer, the Parliamentary Governor of Pembroke Castle, {{refused to}} hand over his command to one of Fairfax's officers, and he was soon joined by some {{hundreds}} of officers and men, who mutinied, ostensibly for arrears of pay, but really with political objectives. Furthermore, many of the royalist survivors had ganged up and wanted the monarchy back in power and control. Rebels from all over Ireland, England and Scotland had joined in with this act. At the end of March, encouraged by minor successes, Poyer openly declared for the King. Disbanded soldiers continued {{to join him in}} April, all South Wales revolted, and eventually he was joined by Major-General Rowland Laugharne, his <b>district</b> <b>commander,</b> and Colonel Rice Powell. In April also news came that the Scots were arming and that Berwick and Carlisle had been seized by the English Royalists.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Louisiana and Texas {{was placed}} in the Fifth Military District under General Philip Sheridan. A Third Reconstruction Act (1867) allowed <b>district</b> <b>commanders</b> {{authority}} to remove state officials from office. Carpetbaggers were appointed to many offices to assure loyalty to the Union.|$|R
50|$|The rank {{was usually}} given to senior {{officers}} of the Ministry of Defence and General Staff, and also to meritorious military <b>district</b> <b>commanders.</b> From the 1970s, it was also frequently given to {{the heads of the}} KGB and the Ministry of the Interior.|$|R
