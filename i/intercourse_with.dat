The second model, the stage termination model, proposed that early first sexual <b>intercourse</b> interferes <b>with</b> subsequent development, thereby resulting in negative developmental outcomes. problem behavior theory was supported. For both boys and girls, earlier timing of first sexual <b>intercourse</b> was associated <b>with</b> longitudinal patterns of greater transition proneness and poorer psychosocial adjustment. The stage termination model was not supported. No evidence was found suggesting that early timing of first sexual intercourse results in negative psychosocial outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual <b>intercourse</b> <b>with</b> their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M.
