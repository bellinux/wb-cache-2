50|$|Because each {{staircase}} {{was constructed}} individually and entirely from wood, {{it is assumed}} that the staircase either broke apart and floated out of the stairwell during the sinking or disintegrated in the 73 years before the Titanic rediscovery. Another option is that whatever remained of the staircase was destroyed by the force of the bow hitting the sea floor and the huge <b>hydraulic</b> <b>blast</b> which resulted. Survivors described a large wave that swept the Boat Deck as the Titanic took her final plunge - this, or the wave produced by the collapse of the forward funnel, is often blamed for smashing through the dome and destroying the Grand Staircase. The surrounding foyers, with their oak pillars, plaster ceilings with oak beams, and chandelier ceiling fixtures all survive in recognizable condition.|$|E
5000|$|The main Replicator {{directives}} in {{the show}} are to multiply and to assimilate new technologies. Replicators utilize whatever materials are available; in , the Replicators created from a Russian submarine are made of steel and susceptible to rusting. Multiple blocks are required for replication, and the process requires {{a large amount of}} energy. Replicators are attracted to the most advanced technologies available, thus they ignore the relatively crude technology of the Earth ship Prometheus in [...] Replicators adapt very quickly to new technologies and they are capable of enhancing technology they encounter beyond its original specifications. Replicators are impervious to all known handheld energy weapons, including zat'nik'tels and staff weapons. They can be shattered by projectile firearms, though given time and relative proximity to each other, the blocks will re-assemble. Replicator bugs produce a corrosive liquid ("Replicator spray") capable of dissolving through any known material but concrete and glass, including the nigh-invulnerable armor of Kull Warriors. In close quarters, they can produce an electrical discharge to kill their opponents. Replicator bugs are strong for their size; a single one held open the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>blast</b> doors of the SGC's gate room in [...]|$|E

Selection of a trench excavation method {{must take into}} account a range of rock and machine properties. It is suggested that the advantages of using chain trenchers in suitable rock outweigh the limitations and may have cost benefits and fewer adverse environmental effects compared with alternative methods.|$|R

40|$|The heat of {{hydration}} {{evolution of}} eight paste mixtures of various {{water to binder ratio}} and containing various pozzolanic (silica fume, fly ash) and latent <b>hydraulic</b> (granulated <b>blast</b> furnace slag) admixtures have been studied by means of isothermal calorimetry during the first 7 days of the hydration process and by means of solution calorimetry for up to 120 days. The results of early {{heat of hydration}} values obtained by both methods are comparable in case of the samples without mineral admixtures; the values obtained for samples containing fly ash and granulated blast furnace slag differ though. The results from isothermal calorimetry show an acceleration of the hydration process by the presence of the fine particles of silica fume and retarding action of other mineral admixtures and superplasticizer. The influence of the presence of mineral admixtures on higher heat development (expressed as joules per gram of cement in mixture) becomes apparent after 20 h in case of fly ash without superplasticizer and after 48 h for sample containing fly ash and superplasticizer. In case of samples containing slag and superplasticizer the delay observed was 40 h. The results obtained by solution calorimetry provide a good complement to the ones of isothermal calorimetry, as the solution calorimetry enables to study the contribution of the mineral admixtures to the hydration heat development at later ages of the hydration process, which is otherwise hard to obtain by different method...|$|R
30|$|In all the Group I, II and III, the {{compressive}} strength of specimen SF 5, binary admixture containing 5  % silica fume, are still {{much higher than}} those of specimens FA 15, FA 25, BS 25  + FA 25, BS 30  + FA 30, BS 50 containing fly ash or/and blast furnace slag at all ages and various admixture. This is attributed to the fact that silica fume consisted of ultra fine particles and increased the bond strengths between cement paste and aggregate by making the interfacial zone denser. In addition, the {{compressive strength}} of specimens BS 30  + FA 30, BS 30  + FA 25  + SF 5 decreased with increasing fly ash and blast furnace slag at all ages, compared with Specimens BS 25  + FA 25, BS 25  + FA 20  + SF 5 in Group I, Group II and Group III. This is attributed to the fact that pozzolanic reaction of fly ash and latent <b>hydraulic</b> activity of <b>blast</b> furnace slag could develop compressive strength slowly.|$|R

The objective of this survey is to determinate Rock Quality Designation (RQD) of the granitic rock mass quarried from terrace 9 (highest) to terrace 7. The SASW survey was conducted with using OROS 25 and the software that used for data processing is Winsasw 3. 1. 3. The Rock Quality Designation (RQD) for terrace 9 varies from 45. 63 % to 94. 17 %. Base onSuharsono rock classification system, these two values suggest that the rock mass is easy rippable and need blasting. The RQD for terrace 8 are 40. 12 %, 72. 43 %, 80. 35 % and 99. 39 % which are classified as easy rippble, hardly rippable, required <b>hydraulic</b> breaker and <b>blasting.</b> The terrace 7 has three RQD show that the rock mass requires hydraulic breaker and blastin...|$|R
60|$|He had tasted toil, {{and what}} toil really is only those know who have borne {{it in the}} steamy heat of the tropics, which saps the white man's vigour; while he had {{discovered}} what, artist as he was, he had not learned before: that, by way of compensation, man may attain a certain elusive spirituality by the stern subjugation of his body, {{even when it is}} accomplished by brutal manual labour. As the Estremedura's sobrecargo he had watched the struggle for existence between man and man with good-humoured toleration of its petty wiles and trickeries, but now it was the cleaner and more primitive struggle between man and matter he was called upon to take his part in with the faith in the destiny of his species which is capable of moving mountains, and not infrequently does so with <b>hydraulic</b> hose and <b>blasting</b> charges, as well as a few odd thousand tons of iron and water in a stranded steamer. Lying still a while, he heard the great pump hurling out its announcement of man's domination to swamp and forest, and then went peacefully to sleep.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using the {{industrial}} limestone, fly ash and pure chemical reagents as raw materials, the {{blast furnace slag}} was prepared in the simulation condition of the actual slag-making process by three different cooling ways, including air cooling, water cooling and liquid nitrogen cooling. Combined with different test methods such as XRD, SEM, IR, the influence of cooling ways on the structure and <b>hydraulic</b> activity of <b>blast</b> furnace slag was studied in the present in investigation. The relationship between glass content, compressive strength and the phase compositions of blast furnace slag has been obtained. The results showed that, the glass content of water cooling slag or liquid nitrogen cooling slag was slightly {{higher than that of}} air cooling slag, there was obviously gehlenite crystal phase in air cooling slag. The 7 d and 28 d compressive strength of three slags did not present positive correlation with vitreous content, the sequence of 28 d compressive strength of three slags was water cooling slag> air cooling slag> liquid nitrogen cooling slag. SEM observation found that crystallization phases in water cooling slag had a small grain and uniform distribution, this kind of structure was advantageous to the latter hydration reaction and strength development of blast furnace slag...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{geologic}} literature regarding sedimentation in the San Francisco Bay estuarine system shows that {{the main part of}} the bay occupies a structural tectonic depression that developed in Pleistocene time. Eastern parts, including San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay, have had sedimentation throughout late Mesozoic and Tertiary. Carquinez Strait and the Golden Gate may represent antecedent stream erosion. Sedimentation has included estuarine, alluvial, and eolian deposition. The ages of estuarine deposition includes the modern high sea level stand and earlier Pleistocene interglacial periods. Sediment sources can be generally divided into the Coast Ranges, particularly the Franciscan Complex, and “Sierran. ” Much of the estuarine system is floored by very fine sediment, with local areas of sand floor. Near the Golden Gate, sediment size decreases in both directions away from the deep channel. Bedforms include sand waves (submarine dunes), flat beds, and rock and boulders. These are interpreted in terms of dominant transport directions. Near the Golden Gate is an ebb-tidal delta on the outside (including San Francisco bar) and a flood-tidal delta on the inside (parts of Central Bay). The large tidal prism causes strong tidal currents, which in the upper part of the estuary are normally much stronger than river currents, except during large floods. Cultural influences have altered conditions, including <b>hydraulic</b> mining debris, <b>blasting</b> of rocks, dredging of navigation channels, filling of the bay, and commercial sand mining. Many of these have served to decrease the tidal prism, correspondingly decreasing the strength of tidal currents...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extension}} of previous researches on mortars with mineral admixtures and super-plasticizers. In this way, the same methodology was applied to concretes and the use of mineral admixture was limited to low cost materials available in Algeria as limestone, pozzolan and blast furnace slag, with current cement and super-plasticizer. The experimental methodology used was based on the volume substitution of the cement by admixtures in mixtures with the absolute volume of the solid phases and workability preserved constant. The main results achieved showed that the super-plasticizer demand of concretes depends on the nature and the quantity of the incorporated admixture. The combined use of admixtures and super-plasticizer has generally a favourable effect on compressive strengths at 07 and 28 days at low rates of cement substitution, which vary significantly with the nature, fineness and quantity of the used admixtures. At 07 days, limestone admixtures give better improvements and reach more than 20 % of gain to the compressive strength of the reference concrete with no admixtures or super-plasticizer, at 10 % of the cement substitution and still better until 30 %. At 28 days, blast furnace slag admixtures give better improvements at 28 days and reach more than 20 % of gain to the compressive strength of the reference concrete at 20 % of the cement substitution and still better until 30 %. This contribution to the compressive strength is explained on the one hand by the reduction of the quantity of water in the mixtures at the same consistency, by the use of the super-plasticizer and on another hand by the activity of Limestone admixtures at early ages and to the latent <b>hydraulic</b> properties of <b>blast</b> furnace slag at 28 days...|$|R
