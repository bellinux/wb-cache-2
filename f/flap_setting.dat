25|$|Contemporary {{bilateral}} transport arrangements prevented BUA from {{offering a}} first class on its East African routes. To compensate for {{this loss of}} competitiveness, Freddie Laker {{came up with the}} novel idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage of the airline's VC10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the carriage of additional freight instead of first class passengers on the East African routes. BUA's VC10s also had extended wingtips that were slightly bent downwards to reduce the aircraft's cruise drag and to help it overcome the instability encountered when entering a stall, as well as an intermediate, 14-degree <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> to enable all-year round, nonstop flights from the then relatively short runway at Nairobi's hot-and-high Embakasi Airport to Gatwick with a full payload and reserves.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{suggested}} that Cooper was shrewd. He demanded four parachutes {{to force the}} assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring {{he would not be}} deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment. He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair, but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had [...] "single-point fueling" [...] capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots. In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch {{in the rear of the}} cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit. Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [...] Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary units.|$|E
2500|$|At the onset, the NTSB {{determined}} that the captain had flown an unstable approach, descending steeply and {{too close to the}} runway. As a result, the captain would not have had sufficient time to correct problems as they arose. Furthermore, the plane's flaps were found to be in the up position, which is improper procedure. The NTSB could only speculate that either the pilots forgot to set the flaps or that they incorrectly retracted the flaps while attempting to go-around. The <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> error could have contributed to a stall.|$|E

That changes with 203s {{displayed}} at the 1953 Motor Show, after which the hitherto protruding fuel filler cap was sunk a couple of centimeters lower into the rear wing, and gained the protection of an opening <b>flap</b> <b>set</b> flush with the line of the bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The RPD is an {{automatic}} weapon using a gas-operated long stroke piston {{system and a}} locking system recycled from previous Degtyaryov small arms, consisting {{of a pair of}} hinged <b>flaps</b> <b>set</b> in recesses {{on each side of the}} receiver.

2500|$|... 20 July 1975 – A British Island Airways (BIA) Handley Page Dart Herald 201 (registration: G-APWF) was {{involved}} in a runway accident while departing on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. The aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a ground run of , and appeared airborne for [...] (with its landing gear retracting), before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back onto the runway and brought the aircraft to a stop. An investigation concluded that the landing gear was retracted before the aircraft had become established in a climb and the <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> and takeoff speed were incorrect. Although the aircraft incurred substantial damage, none of the 45 occupants were hurt.|$|E
2500|$|V1 is the {{critical}} engine failure recognition speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed above which the takeoff will continue even if an engine fails or another problem occurs, such as a blown tire. The speed will vary among aircraft types and varies according to factors such as aircraft weight, runway length, wing <b>flap</b> <b>setting,</b> engine thrust used and runway surface contamination, thus it must {{be determined by the}} pilot before takeoff. Aborting a takeoff after V1 is strongly discouraged because the aircraft will by definition not be able to stop {{before the end of the}} runway, thus suffering a [...] "runway overrun".|$|E
50|$|The Chief Committee of Aircraft Accident Investigation {{stated that}} at the time of the {{accident}} the plane was configured for landing (<b>flaps</b> <b>set</b> and landing gear lowered). It also stated there was no explosion mid-air and all damage was a result of the crash. The plane was landing in harsh, Winter weather conditions, with dense near-ground fog, 6/8 overcast, fractostratus clouds at 250 meters, 7-km visibility and temperature of 5 degrees below 0.|$|R
50|$|The Airbus {{carried out}} a ILS/DME {{approach}} to runway 05L at Taipei Chiang Kai Shek Airport in light rain and fog but came in 1,000 feet too high above the glide slope (at 1,515 feet, 1.2 nm short of the threshold). Go around power was applied 19 seconds later over the threshold (at a 1,475 feet agl). The landing gear was raised and the <b>flaps</b> <b>set</b> to 20deg as the Airbus climbed through 1,723 feet in a 35-deg pitch-up.|$|R
25|$|A new trailing-edge {{high-lift}} device {{has been}} adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap {{similar to that of}} the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential <b>flaps</b> <b>setting</b> for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially.|$|R
2500|$|Variable {{incidence}} {{allowed the}} fuselage {{to be kept}} at the optimum angle for good visibility whilst maintaining lift – particularly useful for a carrier-borne aircraft and with tail-wheel undercarriage. [...] The incidence could be varied from 2 degrees when the <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> was neutral, to 16 degrees when the flaps were lowered to 60 degrees. [...] The lift coefficient with the wing at this setting was 3.9 (double that of conventional and contemporary aircraft), giving a stalling speed of 57 knots. Since it was intended for carrier use, the wing also folded – a remarkable technical achievement {{in view of the}} small increase in structural weight involved. The undercarriage was a fixed tailwheel type to save complexity. It would have been very challenging to retract the landing gear into the wings. It was primarily of wooden construction, in common with the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle bomber since, when it was being built, there was a danger of light alloy being in short supply. [...] The Exe was cancelled in 1938, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin was substituted in the design.|$|E
2500|$|Concern {{over the}} USAAF's {{inability}} to escort B-29s {{all the way}} to mainland Japan resulted in the highly classified [...] "Seahorse" [...] project (NAA-133), an effort to [...] "navalize" [...] the P-51. [...] On 15 November 1944, naval aviator (and later test pilot) Lieutenant Bob Elder, in a P-51D-5-NA 44-14017, started flight tests from the deck of the carrier [...] This Mustang had been fitted with an arrestor hook, which was attached to a reinforced bulkhead behind the tail wheel opening; the hook was housed in a streamlined position under the rudder fairing and could be released from the cockpit. [...] The tests showed that the Mustang could be flown off the carrier deck without the aid of a catapult, using a <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> of 20° down and 5° of up elevator. Landings were found to be easy, and, by allowing the tail wheel to contact the deck before the main gear, the aircraft could be stopped in a minimum distance. The project was canceled after U.S. Marines secured the Japanese island of Iwo Jima and its airfields, making it possible for standard P-51D models to accompany B-29s {{all the way to}} the Japanese home islands and back.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 2006, C-5B 84-0059 crashed {{following}} a cockpit indication that a thrust reverser was not locked. The C-5B {{assigned to the}} 436th Airlift Wing and flown by a reserve crew from the 709th Airlift Squadron, 512th Airlift Wing crashed about [...] short of the runway while attempting a heavyweight emergency landing at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The aircraft had taken off from Dover 21 minutes earlier and reported an in-flight emergency 10 minutes into the flight. All 17 people aboard survived, but two received serious injuries. The Air Force's accident investigation board report concluded the cause to be human error, most notably the crew had been manipulating the throttle of the (dead) number-two engine {{as if it was}} still running while keeping the (live) number-three engine at idle. The situation was further worsened by the crew's decision to use a high <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> that increased drag beyond normal two-engine capabilities. [...] The aircraft {{was one of the first}} to receive the new avionics and glass flight displays for C-5 avionics modernization program (AMP). [...] This accident led to a redesign of the cockpit engine displays, particularly the visual indicators of a non-active engine. [...] The aircraft was a complete hull-loss and the airframe was scrapped, but the forward fuselage became a C-5 AMP test bed.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{preliminary}} acoustic {{tests of the}} engine over the wing concept are summarized. The tests were conducted with a small wing section model (32 cm chord) having two <b>flaps</b> <b>set</b> at the landing position, which is 30 and 60 deg respectively.

Factors investigated for their effect on noise include nozzle location, wing shielding, flap leakage, nozzle shape, exhaust deflectors, and internally generated exhaust noise...|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that it}} was impossible for the aircraft to maintain altitude on two engines with its <b>flaps</b> <b>set</b> for takeoff and at its weight of 164514 kg, which was close to the maximum takeoff weight for an Il-62. It found no fault with the pilots' actions, who could not make a forced landing because of the dark and the urban areas on the ground below. The {{investigation found}} the pilots had followed flight manual procedures; however there was no procedure in the flight manual to cover the situation in which they found themselves.|$|R
25|$|Star Air's only hull-loss {{accident}} {{took place}} on 26 May 1988.

25|$|During {{go around}} the Captain {{commanded}} to retract the flaps to 5. The FCOM stated a go around with two engines operation initiated from flaps 30, in which the <b>flaps</b> should be <b>set</b> to 15, and remain at 15 until above 400 feet and the speed reaches 135 knots. There is a strong indication that the PIC reverted to a procedure for a previous aircraft type he had flown when he asked for “Flap 25”, which does not exist on the MA60 aircraft type. Another action was to <b>set</b> <b>flaps</b> position to 5 during the go around. This procedure was a typical action in the Fokker aircraft type. The Captain had 6,982 hours flying time of the Fokker 100 aircraft type, which does have a <b>Flap</b> 25 <b>setting.</b> In contrast, he had flown the MA60 for only 199 hours.

5000|$|In a July 2016 review, Flying {{magazine}} writer Pia Bergqvist generally {{praised the}} aircraft, but found fault with the flap mechanism and resulting pitch changes with flap deployment. She wrote, [...] "One thing {{that takes a}} bit of getting used to is the flap mechanism. Flaps are adjusted with a large handle in the upper left corner of the cockpit. The location of the handle {{makes it easy to}} access, and each <b>flap</b> <b>setting</b> is in a notch to prevent slippage. To get the first flap in position, you have to push slightly forward before grabbing the trigger to release the latch. For the second and third notches, however, you need to pull back before the handle will release. It took a few approaches {{to get used to the}} opposite action. The new slotted flap design allows for air from the underside of the wing to flow over the flap surface. With the additional lift, the pitch increases a great deal with each <b>flap</b> <b>setting.</b> president Randy Lervold advised me to fly with some nose-down trim before adding flaps. Without using that technique, retrimming was definitely required after each notch to prevent going too slow." ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the NACA symmetrical laminar flow 65, 1 - 012 airfoil. The model was tested with and without a dive recovery flap. The effects obtained by suddenly extending the flap are compared to those obtained with the <b>flap</b> <b>set</b> down in position. The tests cover a range of angle of attack from zero to plus three degrees while the Mach number was varied from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The following conclusions were reached: 1. The lift curve for the airfoil with no flap is essentially a straight line. 2. A flap suddenly extended produces aerodynamic effects which are different from those produced by a <b>flap</b> which is <b>set.</b> Whenever model test results are to be used to produce design information to be incorporated in full scale aircraft, the dive recovery flaps on the model should be equivalent to those on the full scale airplane in regard to dimensional proportions and to the method and timing of operation, if a high degree of accuracy is desired.
