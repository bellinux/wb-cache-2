I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|Captain Henry Blackwood {{arrived at}} Merton early on 2 September, {{bringing}} {{news that the}} French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in Cádiz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading Cádiz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, [...] "He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost disgust me." [...] However, {{after a few minutes}} Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of an hour, on the war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley. This was the only meeting between the two men.|$|E
2500|$|Righteous indignation {{stemming}} {{from his own}} situation and {{the conditions under which}} working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, David Copperfield: [...] "I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Stewart who was Gates' {{subordinate}} {{for over}} a year, took his former chief's side in the political struggle between Gates and his rival Philip Schuyler. When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, [...] "You can't Imagine my Dear Sir, the Satisfaction it gives me your being sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> them by no other Name." [...] In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, [...] "We are throwing up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade. I believe he heartily wishes all engineers at the devil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries, Jones {{stuck with}} country music with a vengeance. [...] Jones never reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and almost never had any of his music played on {{mainstream}} popular music stations in his career. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters {{from a wide range}} of genres. [...] In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones [...] "the second best singer in America". [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'," [...] and in his autobiography Chronicles, Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits [...] "Outside of maybe George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either." [...] Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song [...] "That's All It Took" [...] on his first solo album. [...] In the documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song [...] "She Once Lived Here" [...] at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: [...] "It was my peak, peak moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment." [...] Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, [...] "He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> to mind. [...] You heard his heart in every note he sang." [...] Richards recorded [...] "Say It's Not You" [...] with Jones for The Bradley Barn Sessions in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: [...] "They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. [...] Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there." [...] In the documentary The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. [...] John Prine mentions Jones in his song [...] "Jesus the Missing Years". [...] Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered [...] "A Good Year For The Roses" [...] in 1981. [...] Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: [...] "George Jones would be singing all the time. [...] It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other for no reason at all, and it would smell good." [...] In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from Rolling Stone, Leonard Cohen asked, [...] "Have you heard George Jones' last record Cold Hard Truth? [...] I love to hear an old guy lay out his situation. [...] He has the best voice in America," [...] and the day Jones died, Cohen performed [...] "Choices" [...] on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. [...] In 2013, Robbie Robertson told Uncut, [...] "He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in The Band, but we'd listen to George Jones..." [...] Robert Plant told Uncuts Michael Bonner in 2014, [...] "I now have to listen to George Jones once a day. [...] Amazing singer. [...] What a singer." [...] James Taylor, who wrote [...] "Bartender's Blues" [...] with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told Rolling Stone, [...] "He sounds like a steel guitar. [...] It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. [...] The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice." [...] Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King, Blackberry Smoke and Linda Ronstadt. [...] In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, [...] "He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies." ...|$|E
