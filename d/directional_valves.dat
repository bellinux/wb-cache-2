40|$|Membrane {{material}} is {{one kind of}} special material with nonlinear feature. Its mechanical characteristic is so complicated and anisotropic that the performance is quite different between the single-axis loading and the double-axis loading. So the experimental results with the single-axis loading will usually lead to unexpected results. With the development and widely application of membrane materials, the double-axis property experiment plays an increasingly important role all around the world.

The main focus {{of this study is}} on revealing the dynamic properties of the priority control system for a developed high-speed on–off digital valve. In this article, a detailed introduction to the high-speed on–off digital valve and its priority control system is performed first, which includes the system function, structural composition, and operation principle. Thereafter, a simulation model of the priority control system is established using the AMESim software and the dynamic characteristics are simulated. Simulation results including the variations in the pulse-width modulation signal, coil current, and the main spool displacement of the <b>directional</b> <b>valve</b> are presented and discussed. They indicate that the opening time of the main spool increases with the duty ratio of the voltage signal. Moreover, the main spool displacement is basically equal in one single pulse-width modulation signal cycle, and thus, it is proportional to the cycle number of the pulse-width modulation signal.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{hydraulically}} driven wheel loader, {{which has a}} flexible crane mounted {{in front of the}} machine, has been under research. Flexible boom was excited with a operator given commands, which caused the system vibrate due to different sources of flexibility. The goal was to test cylinder load pressure as a estimate of boom vibrations {{and use it as a}} feedback signal to suppress the system oscillations. Therefore, a simulation of wheel loader was created, which replicates real four wheel loader located at the facilities of Laboratory of Automation and Hydraulics. The first simulator represents a traditional hydraulical system, which has proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valves</b> and variable displacement pump with load sensing functions. A simple controller with pressure feedback vibration damping was designed and tested with different scenarios. After promising results, another simulator was created, which emulates the existing wheel loader better. This experimental wheel loader, called as IHA-machine, has different <b>directional</b> <b>valves</b> and pump operating principal. For working hydraulics, a digital flow control unit was installed. As a power source, IHA-machine has a variable displacement pump-motor, which has a possibility to collect energy from hydraulic system. Updated simulation version was tested with a controller, which was able to control flow and supply pressure. Vibration damping was added to the flow controller and tested in simulator. After this, the same controller was also tested in real IHA-machine. The results showed, that load pressure as an estimate of system vibrations is a promising way to damping the oscillations that exist in the application. However, the simulation results couldn't be repeated at the same level in the real machine. The control of boom with flow in digital valve environment appeared to be a difficult task when vibration damping was implemented. Regardless, some oscillation canceling was still achieved...|$|E

For this reason, the pressure of each bending actuator is individually controlled by a proportional directional valve, and the valves are connected in parallel to a constant positive pressure source. Since the suction cups have only two states, namely vacuum on and vacuum off, we use direct acting solenoid valves that are parallel connected to a constant negative pressure source for their control. In order to obtain information about the pressure states in the bending actuators, digital pressure sensors are connected to all outputs of the proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valves.</b> A processing unit compares the measured data with the current reference values and then generates the corresponding control signals.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} unique control method {{designed to be}} applicable to mobile hydraulic machines controlled by proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valves.</b> In particular, the proposed control method is targeted to hydraulic machines such as those used in the field including construction (wheel loaders, excavators, and backhoes, etc.), load handling (cranes, reach-stackers, and aerial lift, etc.), agriculture (harvesters, etc.), forestry, and aerospace. For these applications the proposed control method is designed to achieve the following goals: A. Improvement of the machine dynamics by reducing mechanical vibrations of mechanical arms, load, as well as operator seat; B. Reduction of the energy dissipation introduced by current vibration damping methods; C. Reduction of system slowdowns introduced by current vibration damping methods. ^ Two case studies are discussed in this work: 1. Hydraulic crane: {{the focus is on}} the vibrations of the mechanical arms and load (goals A and B). 2. Wheel loader: {{the focus is on the}} vibrations of the driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat and bucket (goals A and C). ^ The proposed controller structure is organized so that the control parameters are adapted with respect to the instantaneous operating point which is identified by means of feedback sensors. The Gain Scheduling technique is used to implement the controller whose set of parameters are function of the specific identified operating point. ^ The optimal set of control parameters for each operating point is determined through the non-model-based controller tuning. The technique determines the optimal set of controller parameters through the optimization of the experimental machine dynamics. The optimization is based on an innovative application of the Extremum Seeking algorithm. The optimal controller parameters are then indexed into the Gain Scheduler. ^ The proposed method does not require the modification of the standard valve controlled machine layout since it only needs for the addition of feedback sensors. The feedback signals are used by the control unit to modify the electric currents to the proportional <b>directional</b> <b>valves</b> and cancel the undesired dynamics of the machine by controlling the actuator motion. In order for the proposed method to be effective, the proportional valve bandwidth must be significantly higher than the frequency of the undesired dynamics. This condition, which is typically true for heavy machineries, is further investigated in the research. ^ The research mostly focuses on the use of pressure feedback. In fact, although the use of position, velocity, or acceleration sensors on the vibrating bodies of the machine would provide a more straightforward measurement of the vibration, they are extremely rare on mobile hydraulic machines where mechanical and environmental stress harm their integrity. A comparison between pressure feedback and acceleration feedback alternatives of the proposed method is investigated with the aim to outline the conditions making one alternative preferable over the other one (for those applications were both alternatives are technically viable in terms of sensors and wiring reliability). ^ A mid-sized hydraulic crane (case study 1) was instrumented at Maha Fluid Power Research Center to study the effectiveness of the proposed control method, its stability and its experimental validation.

Initially, the speed behaviour of the digital hydraulic system, using different delay times applied to on/off valves, is analyzed. The cases where the smallest power loss and the best dynamic behaviour take place are identified. Based on this, the actuator speed behavior, flow rate on the on/off valves and actuators and the pressure in the fixed displacement units for different speed steps are studied.
