Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices like Static Var Compensators (SVCs) are used to control reactive power generation or absorption in long transmission line. However, these SVCs will introduce harmonic current in to the system due to the operation of thyristor controlled reactors (TCR). This paper proposes a modified genetic algorithm approach to minimize the harmonics injected into the systems with the operation of TCR-FC type SVC used in conjunction with fast-changing loads. Optimum triggering <b>delay</b> <b>angles</b> used to trigger thyristors in TCR are calculated using the proposed genetic algorithm to achieve better, smooth and adaptive control of reactive power as well as harmonics. This approach can be effectively used to limit the THD as well as receiving end voltage within the acceptable range for linear as well as nonlinear load condition...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{compensation}} of the dc-side voltage harmonics of a medium-voltage (MV) 12 -pulse ac/dc converter is achieved using a series active power filter (APF). The output voltage harmonics {{are dependent on}} the converter firing <b>delay</b> <b>angles</b> and, consequently, on the specific power locus followed by the ac/dc converter. This power locus ensures minimum fifth and seventh harmonics (total rms) in the input current which provides minimum input current total harmonic distortion when the reactive power is less than 0. 5 p. u. The series APF is connected between the load and the converter output via a magnetic amplifier to eliminate the dc current from the APF inverter, thus reducing inverter losses. Voltage harmonic compensation using a series APF, with and without a magnetic amplifier, is examined with both resistive and inductive loads.

The {{ultimate goal is to}} increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduce the effect of intersymbol interference, and eliminate the need to calculate the hologram at each transmitter and receiver location. A significant improvement is achieved in the presence of demanding background illumination noise, receiver noise, multipath propagation, mobility, and shadowing typical in a realistic indoor environment. The combination of beam <b>delay,</b> <b>angle,</b> and power adaptation offers additional degrees of freedom in the link design, resulting in a system that is able to achieve higher data rates (5 Gb/s).

40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{distribution}} system suffers from various problems like reactive power burden, unbalanced loading, voltage regulation and harmonic distortion. Though DSTATCOMS are ideal solutions for such systems, {{they are not}} popular {{because of the cost}} and complexity of control involved. Phase wise balanced reactive power compensations are required for fast changing loads needing dynamic power factor correcting devices leading to terminal voltage stabilization. Static Var Compensators (SVCs) remain ideal choice for such loads in practice due to low cost and simple control strategy. These SVCs, while correcting power factor, inject harmonics into the lines causing serious concerns about quality of the distribution line supplies at PCC. This paper proposes to minimize the harmonics injected into the {{distribution system}}s by the operation of TSC-TCR type SVC used in conjunction with fast changing loads at LV distribution level.
