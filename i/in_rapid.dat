5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> succession by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, {{one of whom}} only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal seams were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in {{the side}} of a disused chalk quarry, the most {{prominent}} feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which its modern name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> sequence against London and southern England.|$|E

5|$|Demonstrators in Milwaukee protested peacefully against Trump and Senator Ron Johnson, and {{in support}} of {{immigration}} and women's rights. They marched from Zeidler Union Square to the Federal Building. Milwaukee Coalition Against Trump organized the demonstration; Citizen Action Organizing Cooperative was also represented. Mystic, Connecticut held a protest of around 60 demonstrators who marched through the downtown area. <b>In</b> <b>Rapid</b> City, South Dakota, hundreds of anti-Trump and Trump supporters turned out at a rally that began at noon. The groups stood opposite {{each other at the}} intersection of Omaha Street and Mount Rushmore Road, near Memorial Park. The event was organized by Joyce Patton.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports {{suggested}} {{it was two}} separate storms that developed and hit land <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> succession.

Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. <b>In</b> <b>rapid</b> succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E

5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and swept through Venetia, taking <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns {{closer to the}} coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> rotation.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Hans Kelker {{succeeded in}} synthesizing a {{substance}} that had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, {{which is one of}} the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.|$|E

5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|L'Arianna was {{followed}} <b>in</b> <b>rapid</b> succession by three brand new Monteverdi operas, of which Il ritorno was the first. The second, Le nozze d' Enea in Lavinia ("The Marriage of Aeneas to Lavinia"), was performed during the 1640–41 carnival; Monteverdi's music is lost, but {{a copy of}} the libretto, of unknown authorship, survives. The last of the three, written for the 1642–43 carnival, was L'incoronazione di Poppea ("The Coronation of Poppea"), performed shortly before the composer's death in 1643.|$|E

5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.

5|$|Since Herrick and {{his brother}} began selling {{manipulated}} taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, {{can be found in}} many places beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called The Jackalope. On {{the other side of the}} world, The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo.
