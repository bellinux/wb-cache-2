5|$|Chapter 2 {{examines}} {{productivity in}} the contemporary economy. Cowen describes spurts in productivity growth, 2.8% between 1996 and 2000 and 3.8% from 2000 to 2004, and he asks if they disprove the stagnation thesis. <b>He</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> there have been gains in certain areas, such as information technology, but argues that in other important areas such as finance, which is 8% of GDP, there has been less value created.|$|E
5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up the {{contents}} of his locker. <b>He</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E

25|$|John C. Bogle, {{founder of}} the Vanguard Group, a leading issuer of index mutual funds (and, since Bogle's retirement, of ETFs), has argued that ETFs {{represent}} short-term speculation, that their trading expenses decrease returns to investors, and that most ETFs provide insufficient diversification. <b>He</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> a broadly diversified ETF that is held over time {{can be a good}} investment.|$|E
25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E
25|$|In the {{literature}} on the Vietnam War, Cedar Falls is evaluated much more negatively. Phillip Davidson {{is one of the few}} authors who sees it as part of a meaningful broader strategy. While <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> Cedar Falls missed some of its short-term goals, he holds that, along with its follow-up Operation Junction City, it had beneficial long term strategic consequences: It dealt a serious blow to the North Vietnamese strategy of protracted guerilla warfare by permanently driving the NLF's main force from the more populated areas and across the Cambodian border. Already this conclusion, however, is contested by Shelby L. Stanton. He notes the same effect as does Davidson but interprets it as detrimental to the American military strategy. Instead of driving the Vietcong into a more “vulnerable posture”, as had been intended by MACV, they were in fact driven into Cambodia and hence into a region beyond the allied forces’ reach where, together with the North Vietnamese Army, they established sanctuaries immune to US attacks.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, Stevens quickly {{rejected}} Rhode Island's {{contention that}} the Twenty-first Amendment gave the state the power to enforce the complete advertising ban. <b>He</b> <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> that Amendment did give the state's greater ability to regulate alcohol without violating the dormant commerce clause, but {{that it did not}} [...] "license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.” ...|$|R
25|$|Locke {{and his men}} {{transport}} Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to Harrenhal. Along the way, Brienne and Jaime bicker {{about their}} capture, Brienne chides Jaime for his poor swordplay, and Jaime anticipates the men will try to rape Brienne, suggesting she submit to their advances or face being killed. However, <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> {{if he were in}} Brienne's position he would make the men kill him. At camp for the night, when Locke's men attempt to rape Brienne, Jaime convinces Locke that Brienne's father is rich and would pay ransom to have her back chaste and unharmed. Locke believes Jaime's story and stops the men from raping Brienne. However, Jaime then tries to secure his own release, promising Locke that his father Tywin will reward him with gold and titles if he is returned to him. Locke feigns acceptance but is actually offended by Jaime's offer, sneers that Jaime is powerless without his father, and drives home the point by severing Jaime's right hand, his sword hand.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled {{workers in the}} rich countries may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.|$|E
500|$|Cotton's {{response}} to Baillie was The Way of Congregational Churches Cleared published in 1648. [...] This work brings out more personal views of Cotton, particularly {{in regards to}} the Antinomian Controversy. [...] <b>He</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> neither Congregationalism nor Presbyterianism would become dominant in the domain of the other, but he looks at both forms of church polity as being important in countering the heretics. [...] The brief second part of this work was an answer to criticism by Presbyterian ministers Samuel Rutherford and Daniel Cowdrey. [...] Baillie made a further {{response to}} this work in conjunction with [...] Rutherford, and to this Cotton made his final refutation in 1650 in his work Of the Holinesse of Church-members.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} song's intro and {{extended}} ending (or coda), the composition is structured into three patterns of verse and chorus, {{with the second}} and third patterns separated by an instrumental section. The song originally contained a fourth verse–chorus combination, but this would be omitted from the officially released recording. Among musicologists discussing [...] "It's All Too Much", Walter Everett describes it as a two-chord composition, whereas Alan Pollack contends that the song's sole chord is G major, although <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> transcribers may well list fleeting changes to C major over the choruses. In Pollack's opinion, these sections appear to employ IV (C major) and ii (A minor) chords yet, rather than formal changes, [...] "it all boils down to neighbor tone motion in the inner voices superimposed on to the pedal tone of G in the bass." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second type}} of source is the burial records written down by Chinese {{charitable}} associations. The IMTFE stated that a total of 155,300 corpses were buried in and around Nanking {{after the fall of}} the city, based on statistics from the Red Swastika Society and the Chongshantang, though many historians now discount the accuracy of the burials recorded by the Chongshantang. Consequently, Askew estimates that the true number of corpses buried in and around Nanking was 17,500, whereas military historian Masahiro Yamamoto puts the number at 43,000. By contrast, Kasahara generally supports the higher burial estimates presented at the IMTFE, though <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> not all of the Chongshantang's figures can be accepted [...] "at face value." [...] However, both Kasahara and Yamamoto have noted that burial records can be problematic in ways that can exaggerate or underestimate the true death toll of the massacre. On the one hand, burial statistics combine together massacre victims with Chinese combat casualties and thus exaggerate the death toll. On the other hand, they fail to include corpses that were destroyed rather than buried and thus underestimate the death toll.|$|E
500|$|In the Fall 1996 {{issue of}} Raritan Quarterly Review, Stephen D. Cox, freely admitting to never having read the book, {{nonetheless}} called Terhune a [...] "hack writer" [...] who lacked [...] "storytelling skill" [...] and denounced Lad: A Dog as non-literature with [...] "sentences [...] are insufferably stilted and hammy" [...] and [...] "have {{a tendency to}} wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions." [...] Terming it a [...] "socially interesting" [...] work, <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the novel has maintained [...] "intense and long-lasting" [...] interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and [...] "desire to have a collie dog." [...] He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography The Master of Sunnybank, stating that Lad [...] "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. Maybe even more than that—maybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." [...] In You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film, Timothy Morris felt the novel had [...] "dated badly" [...] due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to Anna Sewell's Black Beauty he faults Lad: A Dog for lacking an [...] "autobiographical frame" [...] and for leaving readers guessing {{as to what is}} happening.|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} interlude {{that follows}} {{begins with the}} short instrumental movement, the Pifa, which {{takes its name from}} the shepherd-bagpipers, or pifferari, who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either will work in performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria [...] "But who may abide" [...] is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final [...] recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus [...] "Glory to God". The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria [...] "He shall feed his flock" [...] underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. [...] The appropriateness of the Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus [...] "His yoke is easy" [...] has been questioned by the music scholar Sedley Taylor, who calls it [...] "a piece of word-painting... grieviously out of place", though <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.|$|E
500|$|Smith's thesis, and {{the central}} theme of The Utility of Force, {{is that the world}} entered a new {{paradigm}} of conflict {{at the end of the}} 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, which he calls [...] "war amongst the people", and that Western, industrialised armies are ill-suited to the new style of warfare. The defining characteristics of [...] "war amongst the people" [...] are that conflicts tend to be timeless, more political in nature, and fought between parties that are part of, and in amongst, the civilian population rather than between uniformed armies on a battlefield. To prove his theory, Smith provides a detailed history starting with Napoleon, who invented what Smith calls [...] "industrial warfare"—the paradigm in which the entire resources of the nation were mustered and which culminated in the two world wars. In the second half of the book, Smith states that the advent of nuclear weapons rendered industrial warfare obsolete, but that Western governments and generals refused to acknowledge the new paradigm, which led to several significant defeats in the second half of the 20th century. He provides six themes which characterise modern conflicts and proceeds to analyse each in detail, before dedicating his final chapter to his reflections on his command in Bosnia. <b>He</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> he did not foresee the Srebenica massacre, but criticises UNPROFOR, believing that it was not in a position to act even had the massacre been foreseen and that it had no strategy for effectively intervening in the war. In his conclusion, Smith argues that military force is only part of the solution in modern conflicts, and that it must be combined with political initiatives which together will subdue but not necessarily end the conflict.|$|E
500|$|After {{reprisal}} from death, Davies felt {{further development}} {{was necessary for}} the character to continue {{as part of the}} drama; one of the first decisions the production team made was that [...] "we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to be made aware of what's going on." [...] The events of the episode [...] "Meat", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys' [...] patience in relation to Gwen noting that [...] "he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that [...] "the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack" [...] comprise [...] "the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'". Although actor Kai Owen feels that [...] "Rhys will always {{have a little bit of}} a gripe about Jack", <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> [...] "he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in [...] "Meat" [...] in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a [...] "sweet, kind handsome prince" [...] and the latter to a [...] "compelling trickster." [...] Whilst Eve Myles feels that [...] "Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is", she states that it is precisely this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, Singer has {{not held}} that {{objective}} moral values exist, {{on the basis}} that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism {{on the basis that}} people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the [...] "point of view of the universe" [...] and [...] "an impartial standpoint". But in the Second Edition of Practical Ethics, <b>he</b> <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the question of why we should act morally [...] "cannot be given an answer that will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally".|$|E
50|$|On 26 September 2014, {{shortly after}} the vote in Parliament to {{authorise}} airstrikes in Iraq, Prime Minister David Cameron stated {{that there was a}} case for airstrikes in Syria, however, <b>he</b> <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> any British airstrikes in Syria would require another House of Commons vote unless it was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.|$|R
