5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley {{headed a}} {{distinctly}} conciliar government {{and sought to}} introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E

5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Deodato drew {{influence}} from {{the works of}} Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries {{similar to the one}} made in Cannibal Holocaust. These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's Mondo Cane.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E

Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them.

5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E

5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
