5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> were quasi-legal {{entities}} {{in international}} law. The International Labour Organisation in many Conventions called on member states to abolish them. However, the UK never signed up. The major piece of legislation which regulates agency practices is the <b>Employment</b> <b>Agencies</b> Act 1973, though it was slimmed considerably by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. This abolished licences, so agencies operate without governmental oversight, except for a small inspectorate and occasional court cases. After the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster, Parliament enacted the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, requiring agencies (gangmasters) in the agricultural, shellfish and food packing sectors to be licensed.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, Leigh, aged 40 {{and retired}} from {{modeling}}, {{was living in}} France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France.

Leigh contacted the Fords about starting a legitimate modeling agency, {{the first of its}} kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|On December 12, 2005, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams, another {{civil suit}} brought under section 1964(c) of RICO. In this case, {{employees}} alleged that their employer, Mohawk Industries (Mohawk), violated RICO by knowingly employing illegal immigrants {{with the help}} of third party <b>employment</b> <b>agencies.</b> The larger job pool enabled Mohawk to lower the wages of its legal employees and thereby reduce its labor costs. The Supreme Court, on the same day as its decision in Ideal, issued a brief order stating that certiorari had been granted improvidently and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for consideration in light of its decision in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. Under the Ideal rationale, {{it would appear that the}} direct victim of Mohawk's RICO violations was the federal government, not Mohawk's employees.

500|$|Expansion {{abruptly}} {{stopped in}} the 1910s and {{was followed by a}} period of population decline, {{due in large part to}} Spokane's slowing economy. Control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than local people and organizations, diverting capital outside of Spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city. During this time of stagnation, unrest was prevalent among the area's unemployed, who became victimized by [...] "job sharks", who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps. Job sharks and <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> were known to cheat itinerant workers, sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews, thus generating repetitive fees for themselves. Crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s, with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or [...] "Wobblies" [...] as they were often known, whose free speech fights had begun to garner national attention. Now, with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the <b>employment</b> <b>agencies,</b> they initiated a free speech fight in September 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing. With IWW encouragement, union members from many western states came to Spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt. Many Wobblies were incarcerated, including feminist labor leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who published her account in the local Industrial Worker.|$|E
