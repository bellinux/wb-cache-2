50|$|Therefore, the {{macroscopic}} {{picture of}} <b>the</b> current <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> diode involves electrons <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> n-type region toward <b>the</b> junction, holes <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> p-type {{region in the}} opposite direction toward the junction, and the two species of carriers constantly recombining {{in the vicinity of the}} junction. The electrons and holes travel in opposite directions, but they also have opposite charges, so the overall current is in the same direction on both sides of the diode, as required.|$|R
5|$|Solar power towers use {{thousands}} of individual sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located {{on top of}} a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat-transfer fluid that <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, built the first two large-scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California.|$|E
5|$|The River Parrett <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{counties}} of Dorset and Somerset in South West England, from its {{source in the}} Thorney Mills springs in the hills around Chedington in Dorset. Flowing northwest through Somerset and the Somerset Levels to its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea, into the Bridgwater Bay nature reserve on the Bristol Channel, the Parrett and its tributaries drain an area of – about 50per cent of Somerset's land area, {{with a population of}} 300,000.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
50|$|The water {{steadily}} rose, <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> 10 cm hole in {{the bulkhead}} and into the sewage waste disposal tank. Because there were no check valves to stop it, <b>the</b> water <b>flowed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> main drainage pipes and rose <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ship, spilling out of showers, toilets, and waste disposal units.|$|R
5000|$|Plug valves are valves with {{cylindrical}} or conically tapered [...] "plugs" [...] {{which can}} be rotated inside the valve body to control <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> valve. The plugs in plug valves have one or more hollow passageways going sideways <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plug, so that fluid can <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plug when the valve is open. Plug valves are simple and often economical.|$|R

5|$|Topographically, Scarborough is {{dominated}} by two watersheds, Highland Creek and the Rouge River. Highland Creek lies almost entirely within Scarborough and occupies approximately 70% of its total area. It occupies the western half of Scarborough, while the Rouge River <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eastern portion. Both of these rivers flow into Lake Ontario on Scarborough's shore. Due {{to the location of}} the Lakeshore CN railway right-of-way, both river deltas are constricted to narrow channels where they flow into the lake.|$|E
5|$|Wadi Jarash, a {{northern}} {{tributary of the}} Zarqa River, <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> modern city of Jerash.

5|$|Big Run, a {{tributary}} stream of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage. Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> front {{lawn of the}} house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E

40|$|The {{actions of}} adrenaline, noradrenaline, {{phenylephrine}} and isoprenaline {{have been examined}} on <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> terminal bile duct and on {{the tone of the}} duodenum {{in the vicinity of the}} terminal bile duct. These drugs were injected intravenously, or intra-arterially into the blood supply of the junction of the bile duct and duodenum. The effects of the antagonistic drugs, dibenamine and dichloroisoprenaline, were also tested. Isoprenaline always relaxed the duodenum and increased <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bile duct. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine relaxed the duodenum, but had variable effects on <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bile duct. It is concluded that adrenaline acts directly on the smooth muscle of the bile duct to contract it, but the influence of the neighbouring duodenal muscle may nevertheless result in an increase in <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> duct...|$|R
40|$|Background. This study {{investigated}} the effects of impairment to placental flow on <b>flow</b> patterns <b>through</b> <b>the</b> aortic isthmus because in the fetus, this vascular segment is {{the link between the}} parallel vascular systems perfused by the left and right ventricles. Methods and Results. A progressive increase in resistance to blood <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> placenta was created in seven exteriorized fetal lambs by mechanical umbilical vein compression. Blood flows were measured in the ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, aortic isthmus, and umbilical artery at baseline and at each compression level. The severity of the levels of compression was determined by changes in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> profile <b>through</b> <b>the</b> umbilical artery. An increase in placental resistance causing a fall in umbilical blood flow of approximately 50 %v was associated with a retrograde diastolic <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> aortic isthmus even though <b>the</b> diastolic <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> umbilical artery remained forward. Because of the systolic predominance, however, the net flow in the isthmus was forward. With a more severe increase in placental resistance corresponding to a decrease of 75 % in umbilical blood <b>flow,</b> <b>the</b> net <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> isthmus approached zero. A strong positive correlation was found between the umbilical blood flow and <b>the</b> net <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> aortic isthmus (r=. 89). Conclusions.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, {{but they are}} not burdened with the problem of mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|The City of Manila {{is located}} on the eastern shores of the Manila Bay in one of the finest harbors in the country. The Pasig River <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of the city, {{dividing}} it into the north and south. Manila is made up of 16 districts: Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Paco, Pandacan, Port Area, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Andres, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Ana, Santa Cruz, Santa Mesa and Tondo. Manila is also made up of Six Congressional Districts that represents the city on the Lower House of the Philippine Congress.|$|E
5|$|The City of Manila is {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Manila Bay, on the western edge of Luzon, 1300 km from mainland Asia. One of Manila's greatest natural resources is the protected harbor upon which it sits, regarded as the finest in all of Asia. The Pasig River <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of city, dividing it into the north and south. The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{terrain of}} the area has been {{modified}} in the urban core of the city by grading, but maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in {{the northern and southern}} portions of the city. Sowashee Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and branches off into Gallagher's Creek, which <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center of the city.
