5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals {{were well aware of}} the threat that Tung posed; they had <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of the}} air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E

5|$|Boot's {{most recent}} book, titled Invisible Armies (2013), {{is about the}} history of guerrilla warfare, going through various cases of {{successful}} and unsuccessful insurgent efforts such as the fighting during the American war of independence, the Vietnam War, and the current Syrian Civil War. He states that traditional, conventional army tactics as employed by the American military under the administrations of President Bush and President Obama against guerrilla organizations have produced big strategic failures.

5|$|Burnet's first book, Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease, was {{published}} in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, {{as well as his}} sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus.

He <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men.

5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and <b>discussed</b> <b>his</b> plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo's travel to Spain, and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader {{on how to use}} a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances).|$|E
