6000|$|... "How <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it? I don't {{understand}} it at all," [...] said Peter, as he scratched his long left ear {{with his long}} left hind leg.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see they}} are very {{superior}} people," [...] said Bernard. [...] "And little Miss Evers--what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> in the morning? I know what she does in the evening!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Golden was a {{mistress}} of graceful forgetting. Almost never <b>did</b> <b>she</b> remember to <b>do</b> anything <b>she</b> didn't want to <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not lie about it; she really and quite beautifully did forget.|$|R
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that <b>she</b> knows what <b>she’s</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing</b> what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R. S. Gwynn, David Mason, and Deborah Warren, among others.|$|R
60|$|She acted of her {{own free}} will. What <b>she</b> would <b>do</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> and made nobody responsible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Miss Jane, {{there she}} bides {{all day long}} at the stile gaping; not a stitch <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> for her mother; I cannot tell {{what is to be}} the end of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I {{care for}} your maintenance, or what <b>does</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Do</b> you know, sir, that you are {{talking to me about}} a lady whom I intend to make my wife,--who is engaged to marry me? Goodness gracious me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mais, nom de Dieu, I can't teach you. I {{could more}} easily teach a camel." [...] He turned to Mrs. Otter. [...] "Ask her, <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> this for amusement, or does she expect {{to earn money}} by it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bury her yourselves,' he answered. 'What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it for? It was not by {{my orders}} that she impaled {{herself on the}} stake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bury her, then!' {{returned}} he. 'But why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it? I am sure I {{said nothing}} to make her throw herself into the oven.' ...|$|R
50|$|In late June 2016, Vardalos {{hinted at}} the {{possibility}} of a third film, saying that although no writing has been <b>done,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> have an idea.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} art," [...] {{she said}} in broken English. [...] "The little English girl is very fortunate. For what indeed <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> A simple song, no gesture, no acting, nothing. And they pay her. Monsieur is going inside perhaps?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well!' {{said the}} locksmith. 'We must be patient, Joe, and bear with old folks' foibles. How's the mare, Joe? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> the four {{miles an hour}} as easily as ever? Ha, ha, ha! Does she, Joe? Eh!--What have we there, Joe--a nosegay!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} is. Bell is of a firmer mind, and I dare say she'll {{get over it}} after the first day. But what on earth <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> there? I wonder whether they mend their {{stockings}} in such a house as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Frank, {{the first}} {{question}} of all is--How is my mother? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when I was missing? It must have been awful for her." ...|$|R
50|$|Angel Sy as Bing-Bing - called Calla and Lily's triplet {{because she}} is their {{favorite}} playmate. Whatever the twins <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> too.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, {{bowed to}} Father Conmee from the farther {{footpath}} along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you if old Martha'd let ME cook you'd have some decent meals," [...] she told the manse {{children}} indignantly. [...] "There'd be no more 'ditto'--and no more lumpy porridge and blue milk either. What <b>DOES</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with all the cream?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, the {{movement}} of the cone interested Miller more than the messages. [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it?" [...] he exclaimed several times. [...] "To touch Mrs. Miller means that the psychic must not only have free use of her hands: she must rise from her chair and pass behind me and the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thrums," [...] {{he would}} say persuasively, [...] "Thrums, Thrums. You opens your mouth like this, and shuts it like this, and that's it." [...] Yet when he had coaxed her thus for many days, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but break her long silence with the word [...] "Tommy!" [...] The recoil knocked her over.|$|E
50|$|Bates' agent {{sent her}} out to {{audition}} for All That and they liked what <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> a Steve Urkel impression among other things. Following four or five auditions Bates got the part.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Sultan," [...] {{answered}} Godwin sadly, {{and with}} bent head, [...] "whatever <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> for love of me, though without my knowledge. Tell me, is she still here, or has she fled?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Was <b>she</b> {{grateful}} {{to me for}} my plain speaking? Did she ponder upon my words and determine to profit by them and to lead from that hour a better and nobler life? ...|$|R
6000|$|Marguerite {{clings to}} the jewels, and accepts the young man's arm for a {{moonlight}} promenade. And when it does enter into her innocent head that he and she have walked that shady garden long enough, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she has said good-bye and shut the door? She opens the ground-floor window and begins to sing! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{gets the}} bath. What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Why, merely {{opens the door}} of the bathroom, which wasn't locked, and turns on the water. But, of course, no man with any chivalry in him could allow a harpy to be put to all that labour without {{pressing}} her to accept three cents as a mark of personal appreciation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they have}} found that out," [...] said Richard. Granny looked much entertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, [...] "ay, ay, that they have, the lasses--they be sharp enough for anything, that they be. Why, when I tell little Jenny that there's the black man coming after her, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but she ups and says, 'Granny, I know 'tis only {{the wind in the}} chimney.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ep. 5: A swindler {{comes to}} town and causes the {{gambling}} parlors {{to go out of}} business. Is <b>she</b> that good or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> something to her opponents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady St. Simon, then, {{returned}} from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than {{she had gone to}} it. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> on re-entering her father's house?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was much}} impeded by my rifle, having to swim {{with one hand}} while I clung to my {{precious}} weapon with the other. The girl had seen the lioness take to the water, and she had also seen that I was swimming much more slowly than <b>she,</b> and what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>She</b> started to drop back to my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, it's {{the luggage}} they bring," [...] said the mate, slowly {{refilling}} his pipe. [...] "What they want {{with it all}} I can't think. As soon as my old woman makes up her mind to come for a trip, tomorrow being Bank Holiday, an' she being in the mind for a outing, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Goes down Commercial Road and buys a bonnet far beyond her station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{matter is}} that I cannot be plagued with this child any longer' said Miss Ophelia. 'It is past all bearing. Here, I locked her up, {{and gave her a}} hymn to learn. What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> but spy out where I put my key. She has gone to my wardrobe, taken a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls' jackets! I never saw {{anything}} like it in my life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{must tell}} you about the silver-edged {{waistcoat}} which Bunting gave me. Mamma asked me about it, and I told her the truth,--that it was a present from one of the boys for my kindness to him. Well, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but writes back to Dr. Swishtail, when I went to school, thanking him for his attention to her dear son, and sending a shilling to the good and grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat! ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He blinked {{his eyes}} and stroked his {{whiskers}} {{as he tried to}} understand what it all meant. [...] "Who is Sally Sly, and what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> that for?" [...] he finally ventured.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] he promised, [...] "but I don't {{suppose it}} would matter much to Miss Oliver if I <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not {{strike me as}} a young lady who would worry very much about other people's opinions." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS. It {{was well}} you escaped her net: Joseph was hard put {{to it by}} her, and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost him his life. But what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to you? ...|$|R
