There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E

25|$|P. erythrocephalus are predatory wasps {{and feed}} {{on a wide}} variety of larva.

25|$|In South Africa, a {{study showed}} that these snails were most {{abundant}} along roadsides; densities decreased dramatically with distance from roads.

It would likely be very difficult, especially for someone in an intoxicated state, to be able to accomplish such a feat.|$|E
25|$|Media {{portrayals of}} an 'ideal' body shape are widely {{considered}} to be a contributing factor to bulimia.

A survey of 15- to 18-year-old high school girls in Nadroga, Fiji, found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0% in 1995 (a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province) to 11.3% in 1998. In addition, the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population.|$|E

25|$|Kimchi {{refers to}} often {{fermented}} vegetable dishes usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber, commonly fermented in a brine of ginger, garlic, scallions, and chili pepper. There are endless varieties with regional variations, {{and it is}} served {{as a side dish}} or cooked into soups and rice dishes. Koreans traditionally make enough kimchi to last for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as Jangdokdae although with the advent of refrigerators, special Kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is packed with vitamin A, thiamine B1, riboflavin B2, calcium, and iron. Its main benefit though is found in the bacteria lactobacilli; this is found in yogurt and fermented foods. This bacteria helps with digestion. South Koreans <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> average of 40 pounds of Kimchi each year.|$|E
25|$|Several factors make large tree holes more {{valuable}} to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more naiads at a time, {{they have a}} higher density of prey {{in the form of}} tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the naiads to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month longer before drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling perhaps a few dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory themselves when they reach reproductive maturity.|$|E
25|$|Digory picks one of {{the apples}} for his mission, but their overpowering smell tempts him. Jadis appears, having herself eaten an apple to become immortal; she tempts Digory either to <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple himself and join her in immortality, or steal one to take back to Earth to heal his dying mother. Digory resists, knowing his mother would never condone theft, but hesitates. He sees through the Witch's ploy when she {{suggests}} he leave Polly behind—not knowing Polly can get away by her own ring. Foiled, the Witch departs for the North. Digory returns to Narnia and plants the apple, which grows into a mature tree behind them whilst the coronation proceeds. Aslan tells Digory how the tree works: anyone who steals the apples gets their heart's desire, but {{in a form that}} makes it unlikeable. In the Witch's case, she has achieved immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. Moreover, the magic apples are now a horror to her, such that the apple tree will repel her for centuries to come. With Aslan's permission, Digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. Aslan returns Digory, Polly, and Uncle Andrew to England; Frank and his wife, Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen.|$|E

In late 2010, the World Trade Organisation overturned Australia's 1921 import restriction on New Zealand apples on the basis such ban was 'unscientific', after the New Zealand Government had appealed a decision by the Rudd Government which imposed further quarantine measures. [...] Gillard and Key had previously made a symbolic bet on the outcome of the 2011 Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand, whereby the losing team of either leader would <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> apple of whichever of the two countries won; New Zealand won, and Gillard would later honour the bet in February 2013, during a dinner with Key.|$|E

500|$|Among Waters' Victorian-set novels, {{depictions of}} sexual {{encounters}} are also, according to Palmer, {{the most vivid}} in Tipping the Velvet. A review in The Advocate calls the book [...] "riotously sexy", and The Seattle Times suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and <b>eat</b> <b>an</b> oyster is evocative of Tom Jones. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, [...] "Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers. We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us." ...|$|E

50|$|Very informally, causal {{decision}} theory advises decision makers {{to make the}} decision with the best expected causal consequences. The basic idea is simple enough: if <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> apple will cause you to be happy and <b>eating</b> <b>an</b> orange will cause you to be sad then you would be rational to eat the apple.
