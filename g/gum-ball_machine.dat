The pebble bed reactor (PBR) design consists of fuel {{in the form of}} pebbles, stacked together in a cylindrical pressure vessel, like a <b>gum-ball</b> <b>machine.</b> Both reactors may have the fuel stacked in an annulus region with a graphite center spire, depending on the design and desired reactor power.|$|E

Bud Hurlbut operated the amusements, and built most of them. The lake featured rental rowboats and peddle-boats and the Cordelia K. - a side-wheel riverboat excursion named for Walt's wife. Corn kernels could be purchased by the handful from <b>gum-ball</b> <b>machines</b> mounted on poles near the water's edge, and a popular activity for local residents was feeding the ducks who lived there year-round. Knott's Lagoon was bulldozed and paved over to become the main parking lot when Camp Snoopy {{was built on the}} former North parking lot. Some ducks moved to other parks and lakes, but many ducks still live and gather in the Jungle Island Moat north of Independence Hall, and many local residents still stop by regularly to feed the ducks and coots.|$|R
