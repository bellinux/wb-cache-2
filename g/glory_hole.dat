25|$|Public sex of {{any kind}} is illegal {{in many parts of}} the world, and police {{undercover}} operations continue to be used in order to enforce such laws. Adverse personal consequences to participants in <b>glory</b> <b>hole</b> activity have included police surveillance, public humiliation in the press, often with marital and employment consequences, and imprisonment following a criminal conviction. Gay bashing, mugging, and bodily injury are further potential risks. For reasons of personal safety, as well as etiquette, men typically wait for a signal from the receptive partner to come through the hole before inserting any part of their genitals through a <b>glory</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>glory</b> <b>hole</b> (also spelled gloryhole and glory-hole) is {{a hole in}} a wall, {{or other}} partition, often between public {{lavatory}} stalls or adult video arcade booths, for people to engage in sexual activity or observe {{the person in the}} next cubicle while one or both parties masturbate. In addition to the penis, fingers or the tongue may be inserted into the hole.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the ongoing HIV pandemic, many gay men re-evaluated their sexual and erotic desires and practices. It is {{suggested}} by queer theorist Tim Dean that glory holes allow for a physical barrier, which may be an extension of psychological ones where internalized homophobia (a result of many societies' widespread disgust about LGBT practices and people). For some gay men, a <b>glory</b> <b>hole</b> serves to depersonalize their partner altogether as a disembodied object of sexual desire, either sticking through or {{on the other side}} of the hole.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glory</b> <b>holes</b> are {{sometimes}} {{the topic of}} erotic literature, and pornographic films have been devoted to the uses of <b>glory</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Glory</b> <b>holes</b> are {{especially}} associated with gay male culture, and anal or oral sex, {{but may also}} be used by bisexual or heterosexual men, or by men who do not identify as gay, bisexual, or heterosexual. The partition maintains anonymity. Some gay websites offer directories of <b>glory</b> <b>holes,</b> and people sometimes install private <b>glory</b> <b>holes</b> within their residences.|$|R

25|$|Glassblowing {{involves}} three furnaces. The first, {{which contains}} a crucible of molten glass, is simply {{referred to as}} the furnace. The second is called the <b>glory</b> <b>hole,</b> and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the lehr or annealer, and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, {{depending on the size of}} the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.|$|E
25|$|The 34th Division (New Army) was {{to attack}} along the Albert–Bapaume road, {{aided by the}} blowing of Lochnager mine and Y Sap mine (the largest mine explosions of the day) either side of La Boisselle. The mine at Y Sap north of the village caused no {{casualties}} as the Germans evacuated the area in time but the springing of the Lochnagar mine, south of the village, temporarily trapped German troops in shelters nearby and the position was lost. Parties of the Grimsby Chums got into the Lochnagar mine crater before being pinned down by German small-arms fire. The Tyneside Scottish Brigade was to attack up Mash Valley and against La Boisselle at the <b>Glory</b> <b>Hole</b> (L'îlot to the French and Granathof to the Germans) and the Tyneside Irish were in reserve, ready to advance and capture the second objective from Contalmaison to Pozières.|$|E
500|$|The Witham is navigable from Brayford Wharf in Lincoln to Boston. There are two locks between Boston and Lincoln – one at Bardney and {{the other}} in Lincoln itself, the Stamp End Lock which is unusually a {{guillotine}} lock. The main obstruction to navigation is the High Bridge or <b>Glory</b> <b>Hole</b> in Lincoln, a medieval structure which is only about [...] wide and [...] high at normal river levels. In times of flood it is unnavigable. The bridge spans the river for , and consists of an arch built in c1160, with extensions added in 1235, 1540 to 1550 and 1762/3. It is the only British bridge which still has secular medieval buildings standing on it, and {{is believed to be the}} second oldest masonry arch bridge in the country. It is currently a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I Listed Building.|$|E

500|$|In 1791, {{as part of}} the {{campaign}} to promote the construction of the Horncastle Canal, the Commissioners of the River Witham asked the engineer William Jessop to assess the state of the Fossdyke Navigation and the Witham, with particular reference to the problems of navigating through Lincoln, where the channel was restricted by a medieval bridge. He proposed two solutions; the first avoided the route through the city entirely, by utilising the course of the Sincil Dyke to the south, while the second involved lowering the bottom of the channel through the <b>Glory</b> <b>Hole</b> bridge, which was only [...] deep at normal water levels. The Commissioners had imposed a toll on all traffic passing under the bridge, but decided that a channel bypassing the city would have grave financial consequences. They opted for improving the existing channel and the work to remove the wooden floor, to lower the river bed under the bridge and to underpin its foundations was completed in 1795. The Commissioners dropped the collection of tolls at the bridge, but the amount they received from traffic passing through the locks increased as the volume of traffic grew in response to the easier passage through the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous motivations can be {{ascribed}} to the use and eroticism of glory holes. For some, the sheer anonymity is itself arousing. [...] Utilizing a gloryhole is also {{an easy way to}} mitigate any perceived physical shortcomings. One social theorist has described the attraction of this form of sexual encounter thus: [...] "The ultimate sexual objectification of gay male sexual encounters is the <b>glory</b> <b>hole</b> in public toilets. As a wall separates the two participants, they have no contact except for a mouth, a penis, and perhaps a hand. Almost total anonymity is maintained as no other attributes are taken into consideration." [...] The <b>glory</b> <b>hole</b> is seen as an iconic erotic oasis in gay subcultures around the world; people's motivations, experiences and attributions of value in its use are varied.|$|E
