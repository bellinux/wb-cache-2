Like Mason-Macfarlane, he became convinced that war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Roger Fleetwood Hesketh TD, DL, OBE, {{was the son}} of Major Charles Hesketh Fleetwood-Hesketh. Like his father, he {{was educated}} at Eton and Oxford before {{becoming}} a barrister, and later a soldier. Hesketh, then a major, joined Ops (B) alongside Jervis-Read as the department's only intelligence officer. Colonel John Bevan, in setting up the unit, felt that it would only require operational capabilities, and that intelligence would remain with his own London Controlling Section; but with the arrival of Wild, Hesketh was handed control of an expanded <b>intelligence</b> <b>section,</b> which included his brother, Cuthbert, a civilian secretary and an MI5 liaison officer.|$|E

In August 1923 he crashed an Airco DH.4 on take off but walked away unhurt. The Walkers had two sons, Kenneth Jr., born in February 1927, and Douglas, born in January 1933.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January, the Japanese {{military}} {{changed their}} radio communication codes, {{making it more}} difficult for Allied intelligence, which had heretofore partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied reconnaissance and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel, however, misinterpreted the nature of the operation. On 26 January, the Allied Pacific Command's <b>intelligence</b> <b>section</b> informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called Ke, in either the Solomons or New Guinea.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{consists of}} a memorandum instructing senior staff officers in {{the headquarters of the}} War Department to set up <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> in their offices. Those senior Army staff officers included the Chief of the Air Corps, the Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service, the Chief of Engineers, the Chief of Ordnance, the Chief Signal Officer, the Quartermaster General, and the Surgeon General. Also included are a “Distribution Sheet” showing who copies were sent to and a letter from the National Archives forwarding the memorandum to Robert L. Bolin. The memorandum was a charter for organizations that grew into large intelligence agencies in the Army and the Department of Defense. During World War II, the Chemical Warfare Service, the Corps of Engineers, the Department of Ordnance, Signal Corps, Quartermaster Corps, the Medical Department, and the newly created Transportation Corps {{came to be known as}} the Army Technical Services. During the war the offices of the chiefs of the Technical Services grew considerably as did the <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> in them. The <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> survived retrenchment after World War II. In the 1950 s, several of those <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> evolved into small specialized intelligence agencies including the Army Chemical Corps Intelligence Agency, Army Ordnance Intelligence Agency, the Army Signal Intelligence Agency, Army Quartermaster Intelligence Agency, The Army Medical Information and Intelligence Agency, and the Army Transportation Intelligence Agency. During the early 1960 s, the Army Technical Services were reorganized radically and the intelligence activities in the Technical Services were incorporated into the Defense Intelligence Agency and a new Army technical intelligence agency...|$|R
50|$|The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the New Zealand Regiment had <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Sections</b> {{and these}} served in Malaya and Borneo. These <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Sections</b> then became the <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Sections</b> for 1 RNZIR and 2/1 RNZIR on their {{formation}} in 1964. The 1964 Army reorganisation {{also saw the}} formation of the 1 Infantry Brigade Intelligence Platoon at Papakura. The Intelligence Platoon was a multi-intelligence discipline organisation with intelligence operators, Photo Interpreters (PI's), linguists and interrogators. The Platoon was under the command of the SO3 Intelligence on HQ 1 Infantry Brigade - Capt “Buster” Hornbrook. 2 Counter Intelligence (CI) Platoon was formed the Platoon Commander, Capt Bruce Jamieson in the post of GSO2 SD at Headquarters Home Command. The CI Platoon was established as part of the Logistics Support Group (LSG). Both the 1 Infantry Brigade Group Intelligence Platoon and 2 CI Platoon were never fully manned by permanent staff. Rather they operated on the loan back system. The Platoons therefore, only came together for Annual Camps and some training. The major draw back to the system was that personnel posted to both organisations were spread throughout the Army and in many cases had no intelligence training.|$|R
25|$|When the Force Recon {{companies}} were established, they allowed the Fleet Marine Force commanders {{to obtain information}} quicker than the slower, processed intelligence that {{was provided by the}} division recon platoons, which went through each of the battalion's, regiment's, and division's <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> before reaching the force level.|$|R

25|$|A {{security}} panel {{was established in}} 1946 to supervise and advise on security policy and the RCMP's <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Section,</b> although still within the CIB, was elevated to branch status. Further recognition of the RCMP's intelligence apparatus came in 1950 when the officer {{in charge of the}} <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Section</b> became directly responsible to the commissioner, and, in 1956, when the branch was elevated once again and re-established as the Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI) or RCMP “I” Directorate. Following the 1969 report of the Mackenzie Commission, the DSI became the RCMP Security Service and the branch was elevated from regional-division level to national-division level giving the Director-General even more responsibility.|$|E

Communication was to be by visual means, messenger pigeon, wireless, Fullerphone, runners and SOS rockets. Two cable lines {{up to the front}} line were buried by the Royal Engineers Signal Service for the Fullerphones and advanced bases were chosen in the German lines at Spanbroekmolen and Peckham, to be connected by armoured cables across no man's land. When the infantry reached the final objective the advanced stations were to move up to the crest of the ridge. Brigade <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> were to set up observation posts at Spanbroekmolen and Peckham and battalion <b>intelligence</b> <b>sections</b> were to follow their battalions and find places to observe the infantry up to the final objective and send scouts to contact flanking battalions and establish the situation. A divisional signal station was installed on Kemmel Hill in [...] line of sight with the brigade advanced sections to communicate via Lucas lamp.|$|R
