25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|The {{case was}} heard before {{a jury in}} a Los Angeles federal {{courtroom}} in May–June 2004. The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of Battlefield Earth was $44million, not the $75 million declared by Franchise. The remaining $31 million had been fraudulent [...] "padding". Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded Battlefield Earth because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the Wesley Snipes vehicle The Art of War and the Bruce Willis comedy The Whole Nine Yards.

40|$|Personal Projects Analysis (B. R. Little, 1983) {{was adapted}} to examine {{relations}} between participants' appraisals of their goal characteristics and orthogonal happiness and meaning factors {{that emerged from}} factor analyses of diverse well-being measures. In two studies with 146 and 179 university students, goal efficacy was associated with happiness and goal integrity was associated with meaning. A new technique for classifying participants according to emergent identity themes is introduced. In both studies, identity-compensatory predictors of happiness were apparent. Agentic participants were <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals were supported by others, communal participants were <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals were fun, and hedonistic participants were <b>happiest</b> <b>if</b> their goals were being accomplished. The distinction between happiness and meaning is emphasized, and the tension between efficacy and integrity is discussed.

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony <b>happy.</b> <b>If</b> she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it.

500|$|Still {{during the}} race, the {{stewards}} handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was [...] "frustrated" [...] with the decision, saying: [...] "The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me." [...] Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: [...] "I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in on mine, leaving me with nowhere to go, so we hit." [...] Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid Bild called the penalty a [...] "joke". Hülkenberg later accepted {{that he was at}} fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his [...] "mental"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was [...] "very strange" [...] and that he [...] "won't ever change". Maldonado answered by saying: [...] "No driver's <b>happy</b> <b>if</b> there's a car {{in front of them and}} they want to get past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...] We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position.
