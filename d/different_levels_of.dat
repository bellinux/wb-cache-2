This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid; 1948) and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa Penida, {{a critique of the}} Balinese caste system, which followed lovers from <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the social hierarchy.

In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E

It provides two extreme views to the database information: completely public or completely hidden. In this paper, we propose an Observation-based Fine Grained Access Control (OFGAC) mechanism based on the Abstract Interpretation framework where data are made accessible at various <b>level</b> <b>of</b> abstraction. In this setting, unauthorized users {{are not able to}} infer the exact content of a cell containing confidential information, while they are allowed to get partial information out of it, according to their access rights. <b>Different</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> sensitivity of the information correspond to <b>different</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> abstraction. In this way, we can tune different parts of the same database content according to <b>different</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> abstraction at the same time.

5|$|The <b>{{different}}</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ovarian hormones {{at different}} stages of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E

PREAC aims to promote actions of extension and culture through integration with society, disseminating and acquiring knowledge through the academic community.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
