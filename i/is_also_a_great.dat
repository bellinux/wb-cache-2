5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{difference}} between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland {{to obtain a}} feudal superiority over the kingdom. This view of Edward {{is reflected in the}} popular perception of the King, {{as can be seen in}} the 1995 movie Bravehearts portrayal of the King as a hard-hearted tyrant.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNESCO's 2009 Global Education Digest, 6% of Pakistanis (9% {{of men and}} 3.5% of women) were {{university}} graduates as of 2007. Pakistan plans to increase this figure to 10% by 2015 and subsequently to 15% by 2020. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of variety between age cohorts. Less than 6% {{of those in the}} age cohort 55-64 have a degree, compared to 8% in the 45-54 age cohort, 11% in the 35-44 age cohort and 16% in the age cohort 25-34.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the finest}} Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of Gelati, Kiev, Torcello, Venice, Monreale, Cefalù and Palermo. For instance, Venice's Basilica of St Mark, begun in 1063, {{was based on the}} great Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the {{basilica}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., Pala d'Oro).|$|E

25|$|The Vili of Gabon {{are mainly}} located in Mayumba. This locality, {{which has about}} 5000 souls, is the last Gabonese city before {{accessing}} the neighbouring Congo border. The region of Mayumba {{is known for its}} still unspoiled wilderness, its immense beaches that stretch out of sight, beaten by violent waves and violent currents.This wild side is highlighted by the Mayumba National Park, which covers about 870 square kilometers. It is the protected sanctuary where a wide spectrum of animal and plant species flourishes. They include crocodiles, chimpanzees, gorillas, various monkeys, leopards, elephants, antelopes, buffaloes. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> place to observe different species of birds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objects of}} the {{physical}} sciences form the lower orders {{in the hierarchy of}} existence, more extensive but less significant. Thus the atoms of the physicist may indeed be found in the organisation of conscious beings, but they are subordinate: a living organism exhibits actions which cannot be formulated by the laws of physics alone; man is material, but he <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal more.|$|E

2500|$|Cheating in {{high schools}} is growing in the United States at an {{exponential}} rate. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> difference in students' perceptions and the realty of their own ethical behavior. In a 2008 survey of 30,000 students in high school {{carried out by the}} Josephson Institute for Youth Ethics, 62 percent of students polled said they [...] "copied another's homework two or more times in the past year." [...] Yet, on the same survey, 92 percent said they were [...] "satisfied with their personal ethics and character." [...] Hence, there is generally a discrepancy between actual behavior and self-image of high school students' character.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} popular sea sports in the city is yachting. The main yacht clubs are in Botafogo area that extends halfway between Copacabana and the center of town. Though the most {{exclusive}} and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> place to do surfing as well as [...] "Arpoador of Ipanema" [...] beach and [...] "Praia dos Bandeirantes". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this much}} {{discussed}} speech, {{the discrepancy between}} the beautiful imagery and the horrific sight before us has been noted by many critics as jarring, and the speech is often severely edited or completely removed for performance; in the 1955 RSC production, for example, director Peter Brook cut the speech entirely. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of disagreement amongst critics as to the essential meaning of the speech. John Dover Wilson, for example, sees it as nothing more than a parody, Shakespeare mocking the work of his contemporaries by writing something so bad. He finds no other tonally analogous speech in all of Shakespeare, concluding it is [...] "a bundle of ill-matched conceits held together by sticky sentimentalism." [...] Similarly, Eugene M. Waith determines that the speech is an aesthetic failure that may have looked good on the page but which is incongruous in performance.|$|E

2500|$|Mirza [...] is an {{offensive}} baseliner with very powerful groundstroke {{and is known}} for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, {{as well as her}} volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners, which means she goes for lots of angles. Mirza has said that [...] "There's no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it's about the place that they're put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can". [...] "I'm not that fast on my feet", she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving up and around the court. Mirza's second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there are}} a number of commonalities between {{indigenous}} Aboriginal Australians, there <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> diversity among different Indigenous communities and societies in Australia, each with its own mixture of cultures, customs and languages. In present-day Australia these groups are further divided into local communities. At the time of initial European settlement, over 250 languages were spoken; it is currently estimated that 120 to 145 of these remain in use, but only 13 of these are not considered endangered. Aboriginal people today mostly speak English, with Aboriginal phrases and words being added to create Australian Aboriginal English (which also has a tangible influence of Indigenous languages in the phonology and grammatical structure). The population of Indigenous Australians at the time of permanent European settlement is contentious and has been estimated at between 318,000 and 1,000,000 with the distribution being similar to that of the current Australian population, the majority living in the south-east, centred along the Murray River. [...] A population collapse [...] following European settlement, and a smallpox epidemic spreading three years after the arrival of Europeans may have caused a massive and early depopulation.|$|E
60|$|My {{experience}} is, {{that the}} same notes and phrases are not ordinarily heard in any two localities; that the bird is able to emit {{a great variety of}} sounds--some highly musical; that he <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> mimic in a wild irregular way, mixing borrowed notes with his own, and flinging them out anyhow, so that there is no order nor harmony, and they do not form a song.|$|E
50|$|His name {{appears in}} many works of fiction, {{often as a}} helpful, wise man and rarely as an enemy. There are {{exceptions}} such as Nurarihyon no Mago where Seimei <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ayakashi and the Lord of Darkness.|$|R
50|$|C. L. R. James <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{pioneer of}} the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain {{when he wrote}} his most notable work The Black Jacobins (1938), he was an anti-Stalinist Marxist and so outside of the CPGB.|$|R

6000|$|I may {{speak of}} the House of Commons as a school of {{discipline}} for [...] those who enter it. In my opinion it is a school of extraordinary [...] power and efficacy. It is a great and noble school for the creation [...] of all the qualities of force, suppleness, and versatility of [...] intellect. And it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> moral school. It is a school of [...] temper. It is also a school of patience. It is a school of honour, [...] {{and it is a}} school of justice.--GLADSTONE (1878).|$|E
60|$|The {{power of}} arithmetical {{comparison}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> thing to unimaginative people. They know always {{they are so}} much better than they were, in money; {{so much better than}} others, in money; wit cannot be so compared, nor character. My neighbour cannot be convinced I am wiser than he is, but he can that I am worth so much more; and the universality of the conviction is no less flattering than its clearness. Only a few can understand, none measure, superiorities in other things; but everybody can understand money, and count it.|$|E
60|$|The male of the Cottus scorpius, or sea-scorpion, is more {{slender and}} {{smaller than the}} female. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{difference}} in colour between them. It is difficult, as Mr. Lloyd[13] remarks, “for any one, who has not seen this fish during the spawning-season, when its hues are brightest, to conceive the admixture of brilliant colours with which it, in other respects so ill-favoured, is at that time adorned.” Both sexes of the Labrus mixtus, although very different in colour, are beautiful; the male being orange with bright-blue stripes, and the female bright-red with some black spots on the back.|$|E

"There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{office on}} Friday," [...] said Father Coleman to Lothair, [...] "which perhaps {{you would not}} like to attend--the mass of the pre-sanctified. We bring back the blessed sacrament to the desolate altar, and unveil the cross. It is one of our highest ceremonies, the adoration of the cross, which the Protestants persist in calling idolatry, though I presume they will give us leave to know the meaning of our own words and actions, and hope they will believe us when we tell them that our genuflexions and kissing of the cross are no more than {{exterior}} expressions of that love which we bear in our hearts to Jesus crucified; and that the words adoration and adore, as applied to the cross, only signify that respect and veneration due to things immediately relating to God and His service." ...|$|E
60|$|The several humus-acids, which appear, as we {{have just}} seen, to be {{generated}} within the bodies of worms during the digestive process, and their acid salts, play a highly important part, according to the recent observations of Mr. Julien, in the disintegration of various kinds of rocks. It {{has long been known}} that the carbonic acid, and no doubt nitric and nitrous acids, which are present in rain-water, act in like manner. There <b>is,</b> <b>also,</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> excess of carbonic acid in all soils, especially in rich soils, and this is dissolved by the water in the ground. The living roots of plants, moreover, as Sachs and others have shown, quickly corrode and leave their impressions on polished slabs of marble, dolomite and phosphate of lime. They will attack even basalt and sandstone. {65} But we are not here concerned with agencies which are wholly independent of the action of worms.|$|E
50|$|Conditions on {{the islands}} were harsh, and there <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of unrest in the Navy at the time. As a result, there were several {{instances}} of desertion. On 18 September two seamen from Shark stole her jolly boat and deserted to the French.|$|R
