40|$|In {{this paper}} a bioeconomic model is {{developed}} {{for a commercial}} fishery with multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> {{in the case of}} two independent fish species. Where most bioeconomic fishery models focus on either multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> or multiple species (mostly predator-prey relationships) this model combines both aspects for four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> and two independent fish species. The objective of the paper is to find the optimal allocation of four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> per period to obtain the highest net benefits while harvesting at a sustainable rate. This is done by developing a discrete time LP-model for a sole owner fishery, given a Total Allowable Catch for the two fish species.

40|$|Abstract. Motorcycle is invented so {{far more}} than 100 years. Because of having the {{advantages}} of light weight, cheap and fast-moving, motorcycle becomes the most popular traffic vehicle. Traditionally, the power systems of motorcycles are internal combustion engines. Recently, due to the reason of energy-saving, and carbon reduction, the engine in motorcycle is substituted by electric motor. Hence, due to the reason of pollution-free, electric motorcycle {{become more and more}} popular in city traffic. Planetary gear trains can be used as the transmission systems for electric motorcycles. The purpose of this work is to do the kinematic design of three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions for electric motorcycles. First, according to the train value equation of planetary gear train, The reduction ratio equations of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions can be derived.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Arctic {{ecosystem}} {{is changing}} rapidly, yet information on nearshore fish assemblages for the northeastern Chukchi Sea is extremely limited. To address this information gap, we sampled nearshore fish assemblages with a beach seine {{and a small}} bottom trawl at six stations in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in August 2007, 2008, and 2009, and in September 2009. Catch and species composition differed by <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> and between sample periods, including the two in 2009. A total of 16 039 fish representing 18 species were captured in 24 beach seine hauls, and 3108 fish representing 24 species were captured in 48 trawl tows. Beach seine catch was dominated by capelin (83 %), and trawl catch was dominated by Arctic cod (56 %). Species that were good discriminators between <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> were capelin (seine) and slender eelblenny (trawl), and uniden-tified small sculpins were the most common taxa caught with both <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Capelin and Arctic cod captured by either <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> were mostly juveniles (judging by size). Variability among sampling periods in catch and species composition within <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> can likely be attributed to annual variations in environmental conditions, including differences in water temperature (range: 2 ˚ – 9 ˚C). The shallow nearshore environment of the northeastern Chukchi Sea provides important habitat for many fish species and is extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Loss of sea ice from global warming may open up formerly inaccessible areas to oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and commercial fishing. Thus, long-term monitoring of nearshore fish assemblages in the Alaskan Arctic is necessary for managers {{to make informed decisions}} in this fragile environment.

40|$|Abstract. —Few {{studies of}} fish assemblages have been {{conducted}} in large rivers owing to the difficulties of sampling such complex systems. We evaluated the effectiveness of six different <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> (seine nets, boat electrofishers, hoop nets, Windermere traps, trap nets, and minnow traps) in sampling the fish assemblage at 30 sites in the shallow offshore waters of the middle Detroit River in July and August 2003. A total of 2, 449 fish representing 38 species in 15 families were captured by seining (1, 293 fish, 29 species), boat electrofishing (398 fish, 23 species), hoop nets (524 fish, 26 species), and Windermere traps (234 fish, 14 species). Trap nets and minnow traps were not effective in sampling offshore littoral sites. Significantly higher fish species richness and abundance were obtained and more unique species were captured by seine nets than by any other <b>gear</b> <b>type.</b> When effort is constant, the highest richness and abundance are obtained by seine nets. Windermere traps produced significantly lower abundance and richness than all other <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> but proportionally more benthic species. Total species accumulation rates were not markedly reduced when Windermere trap data were excluded. Use of additional Windermere traps at each site could increase abundance, but samples taken by Windermere traps had the lowest rarefied richness among <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> at any level of abundance. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that seine-net catches, which were dominated by midwater schooling species (brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, emerald shiner Notropi...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to describe entanglement injuries and investigate whether different fishing <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> particularly pot and net fisheries, resulted in distinctive entanglement patterns of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine.

Sixteen cases were identified that fit the criteria. Three cases involved entanglements in pot fishery gear, four in net gear, and nine cases with known line type.

40|$|In studies {{evaluating}} the condition and general {{health status of}} fish stocks, the method used for catching the fish is seldom considered as a factor of importance. In this study, condition indices were compared between cod caught in pots, gillnets, and on hooks in the same geographical area. The results showed that cod (Gadus morhua) caught on baited <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> (pots and hooks) generally displayed a lower condition and an older age (i. e. suggesting a lower growth rate) compared to cod caught in gillnets. It is unclear whether these results merely illustrate divergent behavioural responses in fish originating from one single population, or if these divergent behavioural components represent distinct subpopulations displaying different mean conditions and growth rates. Regardless of the underlying causes, the results not only show that parts of the Baltic cod stock are in extremely poor condition, they also indicate that different <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> {{used in the same}} area could target similar-sized conspecifics exhibiting large differences in condition and size-at-age.

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the trends in {{offshore}} fishing activities and reviews the fisheries data collection programme in Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2004. The analysis {{is based on}} data from a large pelagic database (PELAGOS) of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA). The study reveals a continuous increasing trend of total offshore fishery production in Sri Lanka. Total annual production has decreased from 54, 440 to 51, 790 tons in the period 1994 - 1996 while it has increased up to 127, 089 tons in 2004. Further total effort and catch per day (CPUE) increased gradually throughout the period considered. The increased landings are largely due to increased tuna catches but continuously increasing billfish landings are also evident. The shark catches show a clear declining trend in the western zone after 1998 and in both the western and southern zones after 2001. Longline and gillnets are the more frequently used <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> of the fleets that were studied. Due to lack of information on effort or catches by <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> it is difficult to interpret the relative changes in CPUE based on effort or <b>gear</b> <b>type.</b> Length frequency analysis indicates that the dominant length classe...|$|R

40|$|Population {{estimates}} of crabs in commercial fisheries are traditionally {{based on the}} reported catch and effort, with supplementary sampling by researchers. This study investigated the four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> most commonly used by fishers and researchers to determine whether their catches {{are representative of the}} populations. The selectivity of a large mesh trap, a small-mesh trap, a seine net and an otter trawl catching Portunus pelagicus (blue swimmer crab) in Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia, was examined. Both the seine net and otter trawl caught a wide size range of crabs, although most of the catch was larger than the size at sexual maturity. The sex ratio of crabs caught by these two <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> was close to parity. However, traps caught a narrow size range, almost all of the catch were larger than the size at sexual maturity, and catches were heavily biased towards large males. Therefore, although favored by commercial fishers and for sampling crustacean populations in sensitive and protected areas, trap catches are not representative of the population sampled for blue swimmer crabs. Seine nets or otter trawls should thus be considered in the research assessment of stocks as their catches are more representative of the population. Catchability of all four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> was found to vary seasonally. The size and sex bias of trap catches appear to be attributable to behavioural differences...|$|R
