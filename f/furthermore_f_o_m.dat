40|$|We {{address the}} problem of specifring co-operative, dis-tributed {{transactions}} in a manner that can be subject to ver-specification language requirements for this field. Prelimi-nary work was described in 171. The goals that we have in mind in performins this work are the following: ification and testing. Our approach combines the process-algebraic language LOTOS and the object-oriented data-base modelling language TM to obtain a clear and <b>f</b> <b>o</b> <b>m</b> l protocol for distributed database transactions meant to de-scribe co-operation scenarios. We argue that a separation of concerns, namely interaction of database applications {{on the one hand and}} data modelling on the other hand, re-sults in a practical, modular approach that is <b>f</b> <b>o</b> <b>m</b> l l y well-founded.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} variability among isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis {{with regard to their}} pathogenetic relationship with the host. 36 <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>m.</b> isolates were submitted to pathogenicity tests to determine the race to which they belonged and the disease incidence, using a set of differential genotypes and the susceptible “Supermarket”, respectively. For each isolate, a non-linear regression was estimated according to the logistic model and, afterwards, the day on which disease incidence reached 10, 50 and 90 % of affected plants (D 10, D 50 and D 90) was calculated. To obtain groups of homogeneous isolates for the development of disease incidence, a cluster analysis was performed using D 10, D 50 and D 90 as separating variables. To find the probability that an isolate belonged to the group assigned by the cluster analysis, a discriminant analysis was performed, which, moreover, allowed us to identify the most important variables in the separation of isolates. The mean progress of disease incidence in each cluster of isolates was then calculated as a logistic regression analysis. Finally, the degree of similarity between the two clusters of <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>m.</b> isolates (the former based on the physiological races, the latter on the disease incidence) was evaluated with the Pearson similarity correlation coefficient. The statistical approach adopted allowed us to ascertain that significant differences exist among the <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>m.</b> isolates studied, as regards their rapidity in causing disease symptoms in susceptible hosts, and a significant degree of similarity does not exist between the two clusters of isolates...|$|R

A total of 22 CBERS and LANDSAT satellite imagery scenes were used for this purpose. Most of them came from 2004.

Stand growth and yield simulation were carried out for pine plantations, the dominant genus in the study site, by using the SISPINUS software. Hence, it was possible to relate stand volume in different age classes to the biomass amount fixed by them. Subsequently, the spatial information was treated and summarized by meso-region adopted by the Paraná Sate Government, so that the comprehension of the carbon values became easier.
