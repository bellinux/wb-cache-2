40|$|Abstract- Thermal/acoustical <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> are, in many cases, {{installed}} for {{the life}} of an aircraft which can be more than thirty years. Only those in accessible areas may be replaced. In service, these parts are subjected to sub-ambient temperatures as well as heat and humidity. This paper explores the effects of aging conditions including dry-heat above ambient temperature and freeze-thaw cycling exposure on the performance of materials used for thermal/acoustical <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> in radiant panel flame spread tests...|$|R
40|$|Fast track {{concrete}} {{has proven}} to be successful in obtaining high early strengths. This benefit does not come without cost. Type III cement and <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> to accelerate the cure add to its expense when compared to conventional paving. This research was intended to determine the increase in time required to obtain opening strength when a fast track mix utilized conventional Type I cement and also used a conventional cure. Standard concrete mixes also were tested to determine the acceleration of strength gain when cured with <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets.</b> The goal was to determine mixes and procedures which would result in a range of opening times. This would allow the most economical design for a particular project and tailor it to that projects time restraint. Three mixes were tested: Class F, Class C, and Class B. Each mix was tested with one section being cured with <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> and another section without. All used Type I cement. Iowa Department of Transportation specifications required 500 psi of flexural strength before a pavement can be opened to traffic. The Class F mix with Type I cement and using <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> reached that strength in approximately 36 hours, the Class C mix using the blankets in approximately 48 hours, and the Class F mix without covers in about 60 hours. (Note: Class F concrete pavement is opened at 400 psi minimum and Class F bonded overlay pavement at 350 psi.) The results showed a significant improvement in early strength gain by the use of <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets.</b> The Type I cement could be used in mixes intended for early opening with sacrifices in time when compared to fast track but are still much sooner than conventional pavement. It appears a range of design alternatives is possible using Type I cement both with and without insulating blankets...|$|R

50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{that if the}} engine parts could be designed with titanium, then the supporting structure could also be lightened due to reduced forces within the engine, with an overall saving in weight. Other parts, such as gearbox casings were made with a magnesium alloy. Inconel was {{used to make the}} blades in the low pressure turbine assembly and the metal <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> found {{at the rear of the}} engine. This heat resistant nickel-chrome alloy retains its strength at high temperatures and resists oxidation and corrosion. The primary reason for using these advanced metals was to save weight and improve performance, creating an engine with a 5:1 thrust to weight ratio that could produce a sea level dry thrust of 19,250 lb (26,000 lb with afterburner).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this diploma thesis is to perform a complete risk assessment of an <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket’s</b> trial installation for an Airbus A 320 aircraft.

5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} first E36 M3s delivered, BMW racers began {{pressuring}} BMW for a homologation version with which to compete against Porsche 911s in sports-car racing. A homologation version is a car with special modifications from the factory that are allowed in racing as [...] "production" [...] cars, if enough cars are made and sold.In 1995, BMW relented and offered the M3 Lightweight. The major changes to the car were to lower the weight for racing. The cars came without a radio (although the speakers were installed and the car pre-wired for the radio), air conditioning, leather seats, tool kit, or a sun roof. The doors have aluminum skins. There is no underbonnet <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> and the trunk only has carpet on the floor. The under body insulation is thinner and there is special carpeting to lower weight. Overall the changes added up to 200 lb less than a standard M3.|$|E
5000|$|The {{layers of}} MLI can be {{arbitrarily}} {{close to each}} other, {{as long as they}} are not in thermal contact. The separation space only needs to be minute, which is the function of the extremely thin scrim or polyester 'bridal veil' as shown in the photo. To reduce weight and blanket thickness, the internal layers are made very thin, but they must be opaque to thermal radiation. Since they don't need much structural strength, these internal layers are usually made of very thin plastic, about 6 micrometres (1/4 mil) thick, such as Mylar or Kapton, coated on one side with a thin layer of metal on both sides, typically silver or aluminium. [...] For compactness, the layers are spaced as close to each other as possible, though without touching, since there should be little or no thermal conduction between the layers. A typical <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> has 40 or more layers. [...] The layers may be embossed or crinkled, so they only touch at a few points, or held apart by a thin cloth mesh, or scrim, which can be seen in the picture above. The outer layers must be stronger, and are often thicker and stronger plastic, reinforced with a stronger scrim material such as fiberglass.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch date}} was first {{announced}} as January 16, 1962, then postponed to January 20 because {{of problems with}} the Atlas rocket fuel tanks. The launch then slipped day by day to January 27 due to unfavorable winter weather. On that day, Glenn was on board Mercury 6 and ready to launch, when, at T-29 minutes, the flight director called off the launch because of thick clouds {{that would have made}} it impossible to photograph or film the launch vehicle after the first 20 seconds of the mission (the inability of launch crews to film the failed Mercury-Atlas 1 launch 16 months earlier had proven the importance of flying only in clear skies). A large crowd of reporters gathered at Cape Canaveral for the launch went home disappointed. Mission Director Walter Williams felt a sense of relief at the bad weather, as there was still a general sense that the spacecraft and booster were not ready to fly yet. NASA informed the anxious public that the mission would take time to get ready since manned launches required a high degree of preparedness and safety standards. The launch was postponed until February 1, 1962. When technicians began to fuel the Atlas on January 30, they discovered a fuel leak had soaked an internal <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> between the RP-1 and LOX tanks. This caused a two-week delay while necessary repairs were made. On February 14, the launch was again postponed due to weather. Finally on February 18, the weather started to break. It appeared that February 20, 1962 would be a favorable day to attempt a launch.|$|E

40|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{recently}} developed new fire test criteria for aircraft thermal acoustical insulation. Aircraft insulation {{is attached to}} the fuselage structure to provide a noise and thermal barrier. Generally, the lightweight insulation blankets are comprised of fiberglass encased in a film bagging material. The new fire test criteria provide improvements in both postcrash fuel fire resistance and in-flight fire protection. Full-scale fire tests have shown that available fire-resistant blanket materials or fire barriers can significantly prolong the time for fuselage burnthrough and thereby provide additional time for passengers to survive a postcrash fuel fire. A new small-scale fire test method and criteria for <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> burnthrough resistance has been developed and finalized. Similarly, intermediate- and full-scale fire tests were conducted to evaluate the behavior of the thin bagging material films during a hidden in-flight fire.

40|$|The {{market share}} for fibre {{reinforced}} aerogel insulation materials {{is expected to}} increase as production costs are lowered, and in this context, the development of layered products with integrated aerogel is highly interesting. The effect of uniaxial compression and humidity on the thermal conductivity of commercially available aerogel <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> were measured in order to assess the feasibility of integrating aerogel blankets with other building components. The thermal performance under uniaxial compression was measured by compressing commercially available aerogel blanket materials in a heat flow meter apparatus. Up to 11. 5 % decrease in apparent thermal conductivity was observed at a compressive strain of 16 %, corresponding to an applied stress of approximately 22 kPa. The thermal insulation properties of the aerogel <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> remained excellent within the range of compressive stress investigated in this study (up to about 40 kPa), making aerogel integration highly interesting for building components that will be used under compression. However, a 32 % increase in thermal conductivity was observed upon exposure to an atmosphere of 95 % relative humidity (RH). Thus, in order to widen the range of application for fibre reinforced aerogel insulation materials, further investigations should be conducted to understand and improve their tolerance to moistur...|$|R
