We also study the muon trigger efficiency for this channel with the planned Level- 1 trigger and High Level Trigger selection criteria. It was observed that the muon reconstruction efficiency decreases when the two decay muons have a small or large 3 D angular separation, which further affects the overall J/Psi reconstruction efficiency.

During the last years we developed a new approach for the representation of time-dependent magnetic fields (both in magnitude and direction) for the VITESS simulation package. This allowed us to simulate the neutron spin dynamics in practically all polarized neutron devices (RF neutron flipper, adiabatic gradient RF flipper, the Drabkin resonator, etc.).

In the second case, the ratio of bundled/isolated carbon nanotubes is obtained unambiguously through proper modeling of the scattering data and cross-validated with the Raman information.

40|$|A {{specially}} constructed {{instrument for}} measuring the low intensity photoluminescence emission spectra of metals is described. It uses low luminescence optical components and <b>dedicated</b> <b>sample</b> mounting techniques. Room temperature measurements agree closely with literature spectra for high-purity gold and {{are found to be}} sensitive to 100 ppm impurities. Detailed spectra are presented, which are weakly temperature dependent, for gold, copper and unpolished niobium between room temperature and 100 K. We conclude that this work provides accurate luminescence data for Au from 300 K down to 100 K. Although the (variable temperature) luminescence data for Cu are consistent both with the room temperature experimental data in the literature and theory, we conclude the role of surface adsorbates and/or oxides cannot be ruled out. Theory suggests that Nb has a factor ∼ 50 lower luminescence intensity than Au and Cu because the real part of the refractive index is a factor ∼ 5 higher and the density of states ∼ 2 eV below the Fermi energy is a factor of ∼ 4 lower than Au and Cu. Measurements are presented for unpolished Nb, but given the lack of signal detection for polished Nb and that theory predicts very weak signals, we conclude that the luminescence signals from pure Nb still remain below the sensitivity of our instrument...|$|R

40|$|A {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} long-term reliability of power MOSFET-based devices is the electro-thermal and/or thermo-mechanical aging of the metallic parts. In this paper we assess the bonding wire and source metallization degradation of power devices, designed for applications in the automotive industry. Our approach consists in characterizing the metal microstructure before and after accelerated aging tests, by scanning electron microscopy, ion milling and microscopy, focused ion beam tomography, transmission electron microscopy and grain structure mapping. To focus on the wire-metallization bonding interface, we {{have set up a}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>sample</b> preparation that allows us to disclose the metallization under the bonding wires. This critical location is significantly different from the naked metallization, as the bonding process induces plastic deformation prior to aging. The main mechanism behind the device failure is the generation and propagation of fatigue cracks in the aluminum metallization. Away and under the wire bonds, they run perpendicularly from the surface down to the silicon substrate following the grain boundaries, due to an enhanced self-diffusion of aluminum atoms. Moreover, initial imperfections in the wire-metallization bonding (small cavities and aluminum oxide residues) are the starting point for harmful cracks that propagate along the wire-metallization interface and can eventually cause the wire lift-off. These phenomena can explain the local increase in the device resistance occurring at failure...|$|R
