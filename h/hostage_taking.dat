5|$|The Platte Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a <b>hostage</b> <b>taking</b> and {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six female students hostage and sexually assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E
5|$|Sites in Africa {{have been}} marked as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and <b>hostage</b> <b>taking</b> of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E

50|$|Armed <b>hostage</b> <b>takings,</b> {{particularly}} those planned (e.g., by a terrorist group) for political purposes, {{could be considered}} suicide missions. As most governments have a policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists, such incidents usually end with a bloody confrontation between the hostage takers and an armed force (police, military, etc.) attempting to free the hostages. In addition, such <b>hostage</b> <b>takings</b> often occur in a country foreign to those participating in it, making their chances of escape very limited. Notable examples include the 1972 Munich massacre, the 1977 Landshut Hijacking, the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege, the 1996 Japanese embassy hostage crisis, and the Beslan school hostage crisis. All of these high-profile <b>hostage</b> <b>takings</b> ended with the hostage takers being engaged by the military forces {{of the country in}} which the incident occurred, with {{the vast majority of the}} hostage takers being killed in the aftermath. The extent to which the hostage takers in each incident expected to survive or simply desired to capitalize on their publicity to send a message is a matter of speculation.|$|R

50|$|Since 2006, {{the unit}} {{has the support}} of police {{elements}} from the famous CI (Corpo de Intervenção) in the security of the Portuguese Embassies in Iraq and East-Timor. In August 2008 they were also assigned to end a robbery with <b>hostages</b> <b>taking</b> place in a Campolide, Lisbon branch of the Portuguese bank Banco Espírito Santo, involving two illegal immigrant armed robbers with Brazilian citizenship and six <b>hostages,</b> successfully <b>taking</b> out one of the robbers with a sniper shot to the heart, and injuring the other with one shot through the jaw. All hostages were released, four of them shortly after the beginning of the negotiations, while the other two were held until the end. This intervention was generally considered very successful.|$|R

25|$|According {{to recent}} {{government}} statements Islamic terrorism {{is the biggest}} threat to Canada. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) reported that terrorist radicalization at home is now the chief preoccupation of Canada's spy agency. The most notorious arrest in Canada's fight on terrorism, was the 2006 Ontario terrorism plot in which 18 Al-Qaeda-inspired cell members were arrested for planning a mass bombing, shooting, and <b>hostage</b> <b>taking</b> terror plot throughout Southern Ontario. There have also been other arrests mostly in Ontario involving terror plots.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{following}} Maskhadov's {{death on}} 8 March 2005, the Chechen rebel council announced that Sadulayev had assumed Maskhadov's position, {{a move that}} was quickly endorsed by Shamil Basayev, the Chechens' highest-profile guerrilla commander. After assuming power, Sadulayev called for expanding the Chechnya conflict into a [...] "decolonization" [...] of Muslim-dominated adjoining regions and adoption of a constitution based on Islamic law, or Sharia. He also strongly condemned <b>hostage</b> <b>takings</b> and said that {{after the end of}} the war the new president should be democratically elected.|$|R
25|$|Since 2004, {{tensions}} {{began to}} rise as the Georgian authorities strengthened their efforts to bring the region back under their rule. Georgia sent police to close down a black market, {{which was one of}} the region's chief sources of revenue, selling foodstuffs and fuel smuggled from Russia. This was followed by fighting by Georgian troops and peacekeepers against South Ossetian militiamen and freelance fighters from Russia. <b>Hostage</b> <b>takings,</b> shootouts and occasional bombings left dozens dead and wounded. A ceasefire deal was reached on 13 August though it was repeatedly violated.|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} key {{findings of}} a quantitative and qualitative analysis of media-oriented <b>hostage</b> <b>takings</b> involving local people and foreigners in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia during a five-year period (01 - 01 - 2004 to 12 - 31 - 2008). Based on a long-term tracking of Islamist online publications, the chosen approach did not only allow to identify static values, but also granted insights into developments over time. Characteristic patterns regarding responsible organizations, nationalities of victims, distribution channels for hostage media, etc. could in this way be identified.  The kidnappers' organizational affiliation {{turned out to be}} the most significant variable. It decisively affected other factors like number of abductions, likelihood of fatal outcome or duration of a kidnapping. As a consequence, the highest attention should be given to  this parameter when dealing with hostage situations. Another key finding is that insurgents have been increasingly refraining from broadcasting visual representations of extreme violence. This article is based on the German-language dissertation J. Tinnes. “Internetnutzung islamistischer Terror- und Insurgentengruppen unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von medialen Geiselnahmen im Irak, Afghanistan, Pakistan und Saudi-Arabien” -  in English: “Internet Usage of Islamist Terrorist and Insurgent Groups with Special Regard for Media-oriented <b>Hostage</b> <b>Takings</b> in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia”). [1] In the following I shall summarize key findings in order to make them accessible to non-German speaking readers...|$|R
25|$|What {{would have}} been the motive for {{possible}} Russian involvement? During the period preceding the <b>hostage</b> <b>taking,</b> heavy pressure was being brought to bear by the West and within Russia on Putin to negotiate with the Chechen moderates and their leader, Aslan Maskhadov. Public opinion polls in Russia showed that the conflict was eroding the popularity of the president. Promising peacemaking initiatives were also proceeding in the months preceding the theatre siege, some backed by the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Once the Russian special forces had re-taken the theatre, support for the war rose among the Russian public. As evidence against Maskhadov, Russians cited a tape first shown on Al Jazeera and subsequently on Russian television, although only a fragment of the original tape was shown on Russian TV. On the original full length tape it was evident that it had been made in late summer, not in October, and had concerned a military operation against federal forces, not an act of <b>hostage</b> <b>taking.</b> Nevertheless, Maskhadov had been discredited although there is no credible evidence to link him with the siege. In the end, it could be said that both the Russian government and the Chechen extremists had achieved their goals; talk of negotiations had ended and Maskhadov’s reputation had been damaged.|$|E
25|$|Gary Doer {{was born}} to a middle class family in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His {{background}} is German and Welsh. He graduated from St. Paul's High School {{and went on to}} study political science and sociology at the University of Manitoba for one year, but left to become a corrections officer at the Vaughan Street Detention Centre. He later rose to become deputy superintendent of the Manitoba Youth Centre. Doer's work environment was not always safe: he once had to deal with a <b>hostage</b> <b>taking</b> situation, and was attacked with a baseball bat on another occasion.|$|E
25|$|The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) {{maintains}} statistics regarding pirate attacks {{dating back}} to 1995. Their records indicate hostage-taking overwhelmingly dominates the types of violence against seafarers. For example, in 2006, there were 239 attacks, 77 crew members were kidnapped and 188 taken hostage but only 15 of the pirate attacks resulted in murder. In 2007 the attacks rose by 10 percent to 263 attacks. There was a 35 percent increase on reported attacks involving guns. Crew members that were injured numbered 64 compared to just 17 in 2006. That number does not include instances of <b>hostage</b> <b>taking</b> and kidnapping where the victims were not injured.|$|E
500|$|The {{retribution}} for {{a military}} or paramilitary attack, by collective punishment of innocent civilians at Randolph, has been mentioned as an early scene of Sherman's [...] "terror campaign" [...] or named his [...] "First Campaign of Destruction" [...] in the Southern States. Subsequent Union Army attacks, <b>hostage</b> <b>takings</b> and executions of civilians in other southern communities led by Sherman were intended to break Confederate resistance in the South. Sherman argued that residents in areas of Confederate resistance were [...] "accessories by their presence and inactivity to prevent murders and destruction of property", thus potentially exposed to retaliation.|$|R
