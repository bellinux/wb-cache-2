25|$|In 1891, Arthur, Clara, {{and their}} new son Edward Oliver Wheeler headed west to New Westminster, British Columbia where Wheeler went into private {{practice}} as a surveyor. His private surveying work was supplemented by work for the Department of the Interior, and he was joined in his surveying business by his younger brothers Hector and Willie. A real estate crash nearly wiped them out, and in 1894 he rejoined the Topographical Survey Branch of the Department of the Interior. Wheeler spent six years surveying the area south of Calgary, Alberta and in 1898 moved {{his wife and son}} to Calgary. During this period he surveyed the watersheds of the Elbow, Sheep, Highwood, Oldman, Belly, Waterton, Little Bow, St. Mary and Milk Rivers. In 1900, the Department of the Interior announced it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> its office in Calgary, so Wheeler spent the summer surveying the Crowsnest Pass area in Alberta, and in 1901 the Wheelers returned to Ottawa.|$|E

[...] "In my case, organized crime won, but it has defeated me and not society; it has defeated me and my family, but it has not defeated that thousands of contributors who trusted this page and reported despite their fears", the administrator said. He also talked about his experience and the lessons he learned as head of the page, and then thanked those who supported and trusted him for over a year. The administrator concluded by asking his followers to forgive him.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Ridley Scott {{revealed}} he {{was planning}} two sequels to Prometheus, which would lead into the first Alien film, adding, [...] "Maybe [...] even [...] a fourth film before we {{get back into the}} Alien franchise." [...] In November 2015, Scott confirmed that Alien: Covenant would be the first of three additional films in the Alien prequels series, before linking up with the original Alien and stated that the Prometheus sequels would reveal who created the xenomorph aliens. The screenplay for the third prequel film, called Alien: Awakening, was written during production of Alien: Covenant and was finished in 2017, with production scheduled to begin in 2018. In March 2017, Scott said, ”If you really want a franchise, i can keep cranking it for another six. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> it down again. No way." ...|$|E

500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

In late 2007, {{the administration of the}} mall announced that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> down the Lev Cinema. This led to some protests. On its place some stores were built, including the first Apple store in Israel. [...] In April 2009, Africa Israel, which owned 73.4% of the mall, sold its part to Melisron, a company owned by the Ofer Brothers Group, for 1.5 billion shekels.

2500|$|A {{portion of}} the highway near {{downtown}} Kansas City, Missouri was closed on May 20, 1997, in order to film the music video for the U2 song [...] "Last Night on Earth". The band reimbursed the Kansas City Police Department for all traffic control and security costs. A permit issued by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (the predecessor to MoDOT) stated the closure [...] "will enhance and promote the notoriety of...Kansas City's skyline." [...] Mike Right, vice-president of public affairs for the American Automobile Association Auto Club of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star [...] "I can't believe the stupidity of it. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> down an interstate highway that serves downtown Kansas City for a...music video? I've never {{heard of such a}} thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, {{during a}} U.S. House Committee hearing that was ostensibly about the {{salaries}} of police officers in the District, Van Winkle claimed that the editor-publisher of the Washington Post, Edward McLean, had vowed that he “was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> up the Bureau” {{and get rid of}} two of its officers, one of whom (Carolyn Harding Votaw) was a sister of then-Senator Warren G. Harding. In describing the context of those statements, she gave a suggestive account that involved divergent interests of McLean and the Bureau in the welfare of an unidentified young girl who she said was a material witness in a “white slave” trafficking investigation. McLean later testified that his objection was that the Bureau had taken the girl from a hospital and was detaining her without charge. [...] He denied that he had asked that anyone be fired (let alone the sister of a senator whom McLean considered a friend), but expressed his view that the Bureau was “rather a dangerous toy for a sincere woman to play with,” referring to Van Winkle.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E
