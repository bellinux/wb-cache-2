5|$|Scarborough's {{drinking}} water is {{supplied by the}} R.C. Harris <b>Filtration</b> Plant {{at the foot of}} Victoria Park Avenue and the F.J. Horgan <b>Filtration</b> Plant. The F.J Horgan <b>Filtration</b> Plant was built in 1979 and was formerly known as the 'Easterly Plant'. Upgrades completed in 2011 allows it to process up to 800 Megalitres/day and it will also be the first plant to replace chlorine with ozone as its primary cleansing method. Wastewater for Scarborough is treated at the Highland Creek Water Pollution Control Plant. This plant was constructed in 1954 and started processing in 1956. It has undergone continual expansion to meet ongoing demand. Electricity is mainly provided in Scarborough by Toronto Hydro.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a <b>filtration</b> step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as <b>filtration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under colonial rule, {{tanks were}} {{the only source of}} water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM {{supplies}} potable water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia's largest water <b>filtration</b> plant. India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup <b>filtration</b> plant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{investigates the}} tilting modules of the {{cyclotomic}} q–Schur algebras, the Young modules of the Ariki–Koike algebras, and the interconnections between them. The main tools used {{to understand the}} tilting modules are contragredient duality, and the Specht <b>filtrations</b> and dual Specht <b>filtrations</b> of certain permutation modules. Surprisingly, Weyl <b>filtrations</b> — which are in general more powerful than Specht <b>filtrations</b> — play only a secondary role. 1...|$|R

Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple <b>filtration.</b> The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air <b>filtration.</b> This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E

She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a <b>filtration</b> pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the <b>filtration</b> pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E

Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E
40|$|Filtered {{probability}} spaces (called "filtrations" for short) {{are shown}} to satisfy such a topological zero-one law: for every property of <b>filtrations,</b> either the property holds {{for almost all}} <b>filtrations,</b> or its negation does. In particular, almost all <b>filtrations</b> are conditionally nonatomic. An accurate formulation is given in terms of orbit equivalence relations on Polish G-spaces. The set of all isomorphic classes of <b>filtrations</b> may be identified with the orbit space X/G for a special Polish G-space X. A "property of filtrations" means a G-invariant subset of X having the Baire property. "Almost all filtrations" means a comeager subset of X (the Baire category approach). The zero-one law {{is a kind of}} ergodicity of X. It holds for <b>filtrations</b> both in discrete and continuous time. The interplay between probability theory and descriptive set theory could be interesting for both parties. Comment: 35 page...|$|R

Interestingly, we can lift the stability result for combinatorial <b>filtrations</b> from [CSEM 06] {{to the case}} when two <b>filtrations</b> live on different spaces without directly invoking the concept of interleaving. We then prove that this distance is intrinsic by constructing explicit geodesics between any pair of filtered spaces. Finally we use this construction to obtain a strengthening of the stability result...|$|R

5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, <b>filtration,</b> and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland {{invented a}} filter, {{known today as}} the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.

His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after <b>filtration.</b>|$|E
