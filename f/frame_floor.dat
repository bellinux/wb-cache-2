Such {{light gauge steel}} <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. Light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems must be designed to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Floor assemblies with higher fire resistance rating are needed to develop resilient building systems for extreme fire events. Recently, a new composite panel system based on external insulation has been developed for light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> to provide higher fire resistance rating under fire conditions. This article presents the details of an experimental investigation of light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> made of both the conventional (with and without cavity insulation) and the new composite panel systems under standard fires. Analysis of the fire test {{results showed that the}} thermal and structural performance of externally insulated light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> system was superior than conventional light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> with or without cavity insulation. Details of the experimental results including the temperature and deflection profiles measured during the tests are presented along with the joist failure modes. Such fire performance data can be used in the numerical modelling of light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems to further improve the understanding of their fire behaviour and to develop suitable fire design rules...|$|R

Henry Goodhue, Pastor of West Parish Church from 1863-1883 {{established}} {{a high school in}} the upstairs vestry now occupied by the choir. It was the first high school in the Town of Barnstable and was open to all pupils in the town. Affirming the existence of this Barnstable public school were notices in the Hyannis Patriot (now the Barnstable Patriot) in the 1870s: [...] 1852 - Some New England parishes demolished their old structures and built new ones when repair costs outweighed budgets. West Parish opted instead to remodel the 1717 Meetinghouse to the neoclassical style favored in the mid-1800s. The old bell tower was torn down, a spire and belfry erected, windows and doors were changed…So much was altered that nothing of the original 1717 Meetinghouse was visible. A century later, however, restoration architects would discover that, underneath it all, the original structure - <b>frame,</b> <b>floor,</b> walls and roof - remained untouched and intact. Ironically, this option of remodeling instead of tearing it down, unknowingly offered the chance to [...] "protect" [...] the 1717 Meetinghouse until it could be authentically restored 100 years later in the 1950s.|$|E

Models for each analysis case, both coupled and uncoupled models, were set up in SAP 2000, and subjected to three spectra compatible acceleration time histories generated by using the TARSCTHS code. ISO-Base platforms by WorkSafe Technologies were selected as the isolators of interest in this early phase of the project. The preliminary analysis results show a decrease of the relative displacement of the isolated raised floor with respect to the corresponding base <b>frame</b> <b>floor,</b> and an increase of the lateral deformation of the base shear <b>frame</b> <b>floor,</b> when the isolated raised floor mass is increased. A theoretical explanation for the results is provided for the observed trends.

This report focuses on occupant induced vibration of steel <b>framed</b> <b>floors</b> due to running as the vibration source. The history of vibration analysis and criteria in structures is discussed. However, lack of research and experimentation on running as the source of vibration exists; therefore, the history section focuses on walking as the source of vibration. The current design criteria for vibration of steel <b>framed</b> <b>floors</b> in the United States of America is the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Design Guide 11 : Vibrations of Steel Framed Structural Systems Due to Human Activity. This design guide discusses vibration due to walking, running, and rhythmic activities as well as gives design criteria for sensitive occupancies and sensitive equipment. In order to apply the Design Guide 11 analysis procedure for running as the source of vibration, the Kansas State University Chester E. Peters Recreation Complex is used as a case study. The recreation complex includes a 1 / 5 -mile running track that is supported by a composite steel <b>framed</b> <b>floor.</b> Based on the Design Guide 11 criterion, the running track is deemed acceptable.

40|$|Fire safety {{design of}} {{buildings}} {{is essential to}} safeguard lives and minimize the loss of damage to properties. Light-weight cold-formed steel channel sections along with fire resistive plasterboards are used to construct light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>floor</b> systems to provide the required fire resistance rating. However, simply adding more plasterboard layers is not an efficient method to increase FRR. Hence this research focuses on using joists with improved joist section profiles such as hollow flange sections to increase the structural capacity of floor systems under fire conditions and thus their FRR. In this research, the structural and thermal behaviour of LSF floor systems made of LiteSteel Beams with different plasterboard and insulation configurations was investigated using four full scale tests under standard fires. Based on the ultimate failure load of the floor joist at ambient temperature, transient state fire tests were conducted for different Load Ratios. These fire tests showed that the new LSF floor system has improved the FRR well above that of those made of lipped channel sections. The joist failure was predominantly due to local buckling of LSB compression flanges near mid-span with severe yielding of tension flanges. Fire tests have provided valuable structural and thermal performance data of tested floor systems that included time-temperature profiles, and failure times and temperatures. Average failure temperatures of LSB joists and reduced yield strengths were used to predict their ultimate moment capacities, which were compared with corresponding test capacities. This allowed an assessment {{in relation to the}} accuracy of current design rules for steel joists at elevated temperatures. This paper presents the details of full scale fire tests of LSF floor systems made of LSB joists with different plasterboard and insulation configurations and their results along with some important findings...|$|E
40|$|Sendo a reabilitação um processo de grande importância na construção civil em Portugal, a escolha dos materiais a utilizar é um parâmetro fulcral devido ao impacto que terá na estrutura pré-existente. Atualmente no mercado existem soluções alternativas ao betão armado, aço enformado a quente ou vigotas pré-esforçadas, tais como a madeira ou o aço enformado a frio. Estes últimos materiais, permitem soluções construtivas leves, com baixo peso especifico quando comparadas com as soluções tradicionais. Neste trabalho, foram inventariadas soluções construtivas leves disponíveis no mercado em Portugal, tendo sido comparado o custo e peso por área com as soluções tradicionais. Adicionalmente, foi estudado o comportamento acústico das soluções construtivas leves através de métodos comuns (lei da massa) e alternativos (método de Sharp e Meisser), assim como uma comparação dos resultados obtidos nos diferentes métodos. Foi possível identificar que as soluções leves, de madeira e aço, possuem um peso por metro quadrado bastante {{inferior}} a qualquer solução tradicional, na ordem dos 20 %. No comportamento acústico, não foi possível chegar aos valores de estimativa acústica propostos nos pavimentos em madeira. Todos os autores analisados proponham valores de isolamento acústico bastante altos, valores estes que não se aproximam dos valores estimados. Por outro lado, os valores do isolamento acústico nos pavimentos em LSF foram muito próximos dos propostos. Os pavimentos leves são a solução mais apropriada para obras de reabilitação, devido ao seu peso por metro quadrado, logo, menor esforço/carga nas paredes resistentes.

In this document, there had been compiled lightweight constructive solutions available in the Portuguese market, and then compared the price and weight with the traditional solutions. Moreover, it had been studied the acoustic performance of the lightweight solutions through the common methods (law of mass) and the alternatives (Sharp method and Meisser method), and then the obtained results were compared. It was possible to identify that the lightweight solutions, wood and light steel frame, have a weight per square meter significantly low when compared with any traditional solution (20 % of the weight.

Because all the studied authors proposed sound insulation values very high, values which are not close to the estimated values. On the other hand, the values of the acoustic insulation of the light steel <b>frame</b> <b>floor</b> were very close from the suggested ones.

In this case, the floor treatment affects direct and all flanking sound transmission paths the same, for all path directions. A globally reacting floor treatment affects sound transmission in different paths differently, since it alters both the power injected, and the path itself. In this study lightweight wood <b>frame</b> <b>floors</b> were considered, where for globally reacting floor treatments, orientation of the floor treatment relative to the joists orientation are important parameters for their effectiveness.
