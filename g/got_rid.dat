5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer {{to get rid of}} the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse find it in the refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the gun.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail {{to tell the story}} and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

5|$|Haig's {{solution}} to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson {{was transferred to the}} nominal post of Inspector-General of Canadian Forces and the highly effective Sir Julian Byng replaced him in command of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson in command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being reissued Lee–Enfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not made aware of the purely nominal nature of his position until later, when he requested a staff car and was informed that he was no longer entitled to one. In September 1916, Alderson became Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, a position he retained until 1920, when he retired from active service at the age of 61.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Dalmatia in July 1357. Split, Trogir, and Šibenik soon <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of Venetian {{governors}} and yielded to Louis. After a short siege, Louis's army also captured Zadar {{with the assistance}} of its townspeople. Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who had succeeded Louis's father-in-law in 1353, surrendered western Hum to Louis, who claimed that territory as his wife's dowry. In the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358, the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and Durazzo in favor of Louis. The Republic of Ragusa also accepted Louis's suzerainty. The Dalmatian towns remained self-governing communities, owing only a yearly tribute and naval service to Louis, who also abolished all commercial restrictions that had been introduced during the Venetians' rule. The merchants of Ragusa were explicitly entitled to freely trade in Serbia even during a war between Hungary and Serbia.|$|E
25|$|In late 1967, Irvin Feld, Israel Feld, and Judge Roy Mark Hofheinz of Texas, {{together}} with backing from Richard C.

Irving Feld immediately began making other changes {{to improve the quality}} and profitability of the show. Irvin <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the freak show so as not to capitalize on others' deformations and to become more family orientated. He <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the more routine acts.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, women born on kibbutzim {{were much}} less {{reluctant}} to perform traditional female roles. Eventually most women gravitated towards the service sector.

60|$|The harvest months, November and December, {{were now}} at hand, in which I had the {{pleasing}} {{prospect of a}} very good crop. But here I met with a new problem; for the goats and hares, having tasted of the outshoot of the blade, kept it to short {{that it had not}} strengthen to shoot up into a stalk. To prevent this, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day shot some of its devourers; and my dog which I had tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all night; so frightened those creatures, that I <b>got</b> entirely <b>rid</b> of them.|$|R
25|$|In November 2014, {{colleges and}} {{universities}} with ties to Cosby began removing their affiliations with him.

The Berklee College of Music, which had previously awarded Cosby with an honorary degree, <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of a scholarship that it offered in Cosby's name. High Point University in North Carolina also pulled Cosby from its advisory board, and Freed-Hardeman University rescinded its invitation for Cosby to appear at an annual dinner in December.|$|E

LOD 2000 won the battle royal and earned a shot at the tag team titles, but did not manage to win the gold.|$|E
25|$|Until {{it became}} commercially viable, natural gas {{was often a}} nuisance. Dangerous to handle and {{hard to get to}} market, early oilmen despised it as a poor {{relation}} to its rich cousin crude oil. Although early processing procedures were able to remove water, in the 19th century discoveries were only developed if consumers could use the gas just as it came out of the ground. If the gas required further processing or needed to be piped a long distance to market, the producer shut in the well. Flares <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of gas coming from oil wells.|$|E

I thought it was a really interesting thing and then Rick Springfield recorded that song and <b>got</b> completely <b>rid</b> of that and wrote a vocal bridge for it … it was like … coward.

25|$|Carr's natural father, Lucien Carr, was a writer, {{who in the}} 1940s was at {{the center}} of a group of as-yet unknown writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs). In the summer of 1944, he killed his former scoutmaster, a man who was enamoured with him.

25|$|Johnson was {{influential}} in Zimbabwe's qualification to the Super Six {{stage of the}} 1999 World Cup. He won three Man-of-the-Match awards in the tournament. One of those awards came in his side's surprise victory over eventual semi-finalists South Africa. Opening the batting, he top-scored with 76 before dismissing Gary Kirsten with the first ball of the South African chase. He then <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of Jacques Kallis for a duck and finished with 3 for 27. In the same tournament, he made an unbeaten 132 and took 2/43 against eventual champions Australia at Lord's. Johnson is notable for having opened both the batting and bowling for his country in this World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Chief Justice, Marshall changed {{the manner in}} which the Supreme Court announced its decisions. Previously, each Justice would author a separate opinion (known as a seriatim opinion) as was done in the Virginia Supreme Court of his day and is still done today in the United Kingdom and Australia. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule. As Marshall was almost always the author of this opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole spokesman in important cases. Marshall also <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> of the tradition that U.S. Supreme Court justices had inherited from the British of wearing ornate powdered wigs and red robes with ermine trim.|$|E

Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go.
