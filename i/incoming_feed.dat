50|$|The screen scroll {{centrifuge}} has {{an advantage}} {{of having a}} driven scroll helical conveyor which gives a small differential speed relative to the conical basket. The helical conveyor is installed in the centrifuge to control the transport of the <b>incoming</b> <b>feed,</b> allowing the residence time of the solids in the basket to be increased giving enhanced process performance. Moreover, the helical conveyor and conical basket sections are designed in certain angle of 10°, 15° and 20° being common such that solid particles are dragged on the conveyor along the cone towards the discharge point. As a result, there is no formation of even solids layer but form piles of triangular section {{in front of the}} blades of the conveyor. The residence time within screen scroll centrifuge is typically about 4 to 15 seconds which is longer than normal simpler conical basket centrifuge.

Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays <b>incoming</b> <b>feed</b> water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

They were coming from: 11 EU countries and Norway, Brazil and US, 3 UN agencies, and 2 NGOs. The workshop's purpose was to measure the added value of mobile assessment technology for rapid situation assessment in international emergency operations. Seven mobile assessment systems were deployed among the participants and needed to provide, in an interoperable way, real-time data to a single electronic On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (eOSOCC). The performance of the systems was benchmarked against a traditional paper-based assessment that was conducted simultaneously (pOSOCC). In the workshop experiment both paper and electronic On-Site Operations Coordination Centres (OSOCCs) reached a similar situation awareness in the same time, but only the eOSOCC had products available as sharable electronic maps and documents. The final map with all <b>incoming</b> <b>feeds</b> in the eOSOCC was very cluttered and there was considerable information overload. Therefore sophisticated editing, filtering, and visualization functionalities have to be available for eOSOCC staff. Mobile technology is mature and can be deployed in an interoperable way. However, then the information of each system leaves the proprietary applications for processing and analyzing the data. The main impression from the eOSOCC team was {{that there is a lot}} of potential. Having access in real-time to field information was felt to be extremely useful. Still missing are tools and procedures for exploiting this benefit. Most important are tools to curate, filter, manipulate, edit, and delete assessment information of all teams.

This issue is important since the sulfur concentration in these process streams is l ow.

Spectral interferences are caused by background emission from plasma recombination events, scattered and stray light from the line emission of high concentration elements, or molecular band emission and from direct or tailing spectral line overlap from a matrix element.

A gradient in a SMB process can be established by using different solvent strengths in the <b>incoming</b> <b>feed</b> and desorbent streams, resulting in two internal plateaus of elution strength. Thus, compared to the conventional process, the overall amount of solvent needed can be reduced, productivity can be increased and more concentrated product streams can be obtained.

40|$|Temperature-phased {{anaerobic}} digestion (TPAD) is an emerging technology that facilitates improved performance and pathogen destruction in anaerobic sewage sludge digestion by optimising conditions for 1) hydrolytic and acidogenic organisms in a first-stage/pre-treatment reactor and then 2) methogenic populations {{in a second}} stage reactor. Pre-treatment reactors are typically operated at 55 - 65 °C and as such select for thermophilic bacterial communities. However, details of key microbial populations in hydrolytic communities and links to functionality are very limited. In this study, experimental thermophilic pre-treatment (TP) and control mesophilic pre-treatment (MP) reactors were operated as first-stages of TPAD systems treating activated sludge for 340 days. The TP system was operated sequentially at 50, 60 and 65 °C, while the MP rector was held at 35 °C for the entire period. The composition of microbial communities associated with the MP and TP pre-treatment reactors was characterised weekly using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) supported by clone library sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. The outcomes of this approach were confirmed using 454 pyrosequencing of gene amplicons and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH).

In this paper, we examine {{the problem of how}} to schedule multiple Continuous Queries (CQs) in a DSMS to optimize different Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. We show that, unlike traditional on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different from policies that optimize for average slowdown, which is a more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. Towards this, we propose policies to optimize for the average-case performance for both metrics. Additionally, we propose a hybrid scheduling policy that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness, by looking at both the average- and worst-case performance, for both metrics. We also show how our policies can be adaptive enough to handle the inherent dynamic nature of monitoring applications. Furthermore, we discuss how our policies can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis novel configurations and operating strategies in the mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) crystalliser are investigated, aided by integrated process analytical technologies (PAT) and crystallisation informatics system (CryPRINS) tools. The MSMPR is an idealised crystalliser model that assumes: steady-state operation; well mixed suspension with no product classification, such that all volume elements contain a mixture of particles (small and large) and crystal size distribution (CSD) that is independent of location in the crystalliser and is identical of the product withdrawn; and uniform supersaturation thought, leading to constant nucleation and growth rates. Single-stage MSMPR designs with continuous recycle/recirculation and modified heat exchanger were investigated and found to minimise fouling, encrustation and transfer line blockages. In particular, a modified MSMPR with baffled heat exchanger was found to significantly reduce the temperature between <b>incoming</b> <b>feed</b> hot feed solution and the cooled crystalliser, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} fouling, encrustation and blockages. In addition, the concept of the periodic mixed suspension mixed product removal (PMSMPR) crystallisation process is demonstrated for the first time viz single- and multi-stage cascaded operations. This method of operation involves the periodic transfer of slurry (addition and withdrawal) at high flow rates from either a single stirred vessel or between a number of stirred vessels arranged in series. The PMSMPR is therefore characterised by periodic withdrawals of product slurry. Similar to the MSMPR, the product withdrawn from a PMSMPR has exactly the same composition as the vessel at the time of removal. The rapid withdrawal of slurry at high flow rates in PMSMPR operation leads to the prevention of particle sedimentation and blockage of transfer lines. The transfer of slurry (to/from) the PMSMPR is followed by a holding (or pause) period when no addition or withdrawal of slurry takes place. The holding period extends the mean residence time of the PMSMPR relative to a typical MSMPR, thereby increasing the yield and productivity of crystallisation as more time is allowed for consumption of available supersaturation viz crystal growth and nucleation. A state of controlled operation (SCO) in the periodic flow process, defined as a state of the system that maintains itself despite regular, but controlled disruptions was characterised using the PAT tools and CryPRINS within an intelligent decision support (IDS) framework. The crystallisation of paracetamol (PCM) from isopropyl alcohol (IPA) using different configurations of a single-stage continuous MSMPR crystalliser that incorporated continuous recycle and recirculation loop, and a novel design with baffled heat exchanger was investigated. Crystallisations of PCM-IPA carried out in the MSMPR without heat exchanger suffered from severe fouling, encrustation and blockage problems due to the high level of supersaturation (S = 1. 39) in the crystalliser, which was required for the initial burst of nucleation to generate enough particles for later growth, as well as the large temperature difference between the <b>incoming</b> <b>feed</b> (45 oC) and the crystalliser (10 oC). Using the modified MSMPR design with baffled heat exchanger, the challenges of fouling, encrustation and blockage were significantly reduced due to the rapid lowering of the feed stream temperature prior to entering the crystalliser. In addition, the closed loop system led to conservation of material, which is a great benefit since large amounts of materials would otherwise be required if the MSMPR was operated with continuous product removal. This design is great for research purposes, in particular, to investigate process design and optimisation. Continuous crystallisation of PCM in the presence of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) additive was investigated in the modified MSMPR design with heat exchanger. HPMC was found to improve the crystallisation performance, leading to complete avoidance of fouling, encrustation and blockages at a concentration of 0. 05 wt...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a crushing plant is an essential element in achieving efficient production of aggregates or metals. A crushing plant´s operating performance depends on the design and configuration of each individual process unit, {{the configuration of the}} plant, the design of the control system, events occurring in the process and the physical properties of the <b>incoming</b> <b>feed.</b> The production process is a continuous process and as such it is also subjected to variations and changes in performance depending on the condition of the process. Crushing plants however, are traditionally simulated with steady-state simulation models which are not capable of predicting these conditions. A different technique is therefore necessary in order to estimate the actual behaviour of the plant with respect to time. Crushing plants are affected by both gradual and discrete changes in the process over time which alters the {{performance of}} the entire system, making it dynamic. A dynamic simulation is defined in this thesis as continuous simulations with sets of differential equations with static equations to reproduce the dynamic {{performance of a}} system. In this thesis multiple operational issues have been identified in order to achieve adequate process fidelity for simulation purposes. These operational issues have been addressed by introducing methods and models for representing different dynamic aspects of the process. These include: different types of bins to handle misaligned feeding, segregation and different flow behaviour, the use of system identification to measure actuator response to accurately estimate unit response, wear estimation for crushers, mechanistic models for crushers and screens for more accurate estimation of unit dynamics, segmented conveyors that can estimate material flow for conveyors with variable speed drives, parameter selection for optimum process performance, discrete events that occur within the process and different control strategies to capture the process dynamics. Different applications for dynamic simulation have been explored and demonstrated in this thesis. These include: process evaluation, control development, process optimization, operational planning, maintenance scheduling and operator training. Each of these areas puts different constraints on the modelling of crushing plants and the level of fidelity, which is determined by the purpose of the simulation. In conclusion, dynamic simulation of production processes has the ability to provide the user with in-depth understanding about the simulated process, details that are usually not available with static simulations. Multiple factors can affect the performance of a crushing plant, factors that need {{to be included in the}} simulation to be able to estimate the actual plant performance...|$|E
40|$|Membrane-based CO 2 -separation {{technology}} {{attached to}} large emission sources is consid-ered a possible bridging solution towards a carbon dioxide-neutral energy system. To make this technology competitive {{with the standard}} separation process for post-combustion cap-ture – chemical absorption – necessitates {{the development of a}} membrane module that uses the installed membrane area effectively, in addition to research on high-performance mem-brane materials and energy-efficient separation processes. Therefore, based on a concept developed by the Helmholtz Center Geesthacht, in this work a novel module for flat sheet membranes operated in countercurrent is fluid-dynamically and procedurally analyzed and designed to enable CO 2 -separation from power plant flue gas in two steps. In the first step, a membrane module with a membrane area of 5. 66 m² was investigated re-garding dead zones, bypass currents and inhomogeneous flow distributions using computa-tional fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Therefore, an overall methodology was developed that enabled simulation of the entire membrane module within a reasonable time. The spa-cers between two membrane envelopes of a membrane stack are approximated by a validated substitutional model by means of a porous body with equal pressure drop characteris-tics. Permeation through the membrane was enabled by a user-defined source-and-sink function. The degree of separation calculated in the CFD simulations is compared with that for ideal incident flow and complete utilization of the installed membrane area. It was found that 27 % of the <b>incoming</b> <b>feed</b> gas bypasses the active membrane area through the tapering {{at the edge of the}} membrane envelopes. By sealing this bypass, the degree of separation could be increased by 12. 8 %-points to 81. 3 %. Although a variation in the inlet geometry of the membrane module by installing baffle plates resulted in a uniform flow distribution at the very beginning of the membrane stack, the degree of separation for the chosen geometry could not be improved, since the backpressure of the spacers installed between the feed channels already causes homogenization of the flow distribution. The second step in the design was to find a module geometry that is optimized with regard to the CO 2 avoidance costs via process simulations. Therefore, a two-stage separation process was taken as a basis and the module geometry of both separation stages was simultaneous-ly optimized by means of a systematic variation of single dimensions. For this, a quasi-one-dimensional substitutional model for the simulation of the membrane module was developed that takes into account fluid mechanical effects. To provide a standard of comparison, a re-ference case was defined and simulated. This has a membrane area of 3. 1 million m² and an efficiency loss of 6. 6 %-points. The CO 2 avoidance costs amount to 68. 0 €·tCO 2 - 1 and this could be reduced to 57. 2 €·tCO 2 - 1 with the choice of optimized channel heights in the feed and permeate of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively. At the same time, the inlet velocity into the mem-brane stack was optimized to 0. 5 m·s- 1 in the first separation stage and 1. 1 m·s- 1 in the sec-ond. Furthermore, it was shown that in the second separation stage the division of the mem-brane module into a first part that is operated in a co-current and a subsequent part operated in a counter-current is useful because a sweep gas effect is exploited...|$|E

The second way to retrace the path of the fire towards the origin was by the use of the effects produced, which they broke down into evaluating six parts including (a) char, (b) remains and debris, (c) room temperatures, (d) sequence of shorted electric circuits, (e) sequence of sprinkler eruptions, (f) interiors of partitions and (g) adjoining properties.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} size of web-server {{farms and}} {{the sheer volume of}} HTTP requests, makes hard to collect performance measurements and monitor the state of a farm in real time. Further, it increases the cost of a bad algorithmic or architectural decision, while predicting the performance of new algorithms and architectures is also hard. We propose a way to side-step these problems, by intelligently combining small-scale experiments and analysis. Our hypothesis is this: if we take a sample of the <b>incoming</b> requests, and <b>feed</b> it into a suitably scaled version of the web farm, we can extrapolate from the performance of the scaled system to that of the original. Our main nding is that when we suitably scale a web-server farm, then performance measures such as mean response time and throughput are left virtually unchanged. We show this using experiments and simple analysis...|$|R
40|$|Video {{surveillance}} {{can be a}} {{very powerful}} tool in the fight against crime, by accurately monitoring human activities. Nevertheless, most surveillance systems today provide only a passive form of site monitoring. Extensive video records may be kept to help find the instigator of criminal activities after the crime has been committed but preventive measures usually require human involvement. In addition to this, {{there is a need for}} large amounts of data storage to keep up to several terabytes of video streams that may be needed for later analysis. In order to achieve any form of real-time monitoring, guards often need to be employed to watch video feeds for hours on end to recognize suspicious, dangerous or potentially harmful situations. In a multi-camera scene monitoring system, this can be quite infeasible as there can be up to 20 to 50 cameras on average in a large building complex such as an airport or shopping malls. Intelligent video surveillance aims to reduce or even eliminate the need for human supervision of video feeds, and continuous recording. Having such a system will provide numerous other facilities and services to operators and emergency teams, by conducting behavioral analysis on <b>incoming</b> video <b>feeds</b> and detecting unusual or suspicious behavior. Behavioral analysis itself can be applied to numerous features extracted from video sequences including path detection and classification of which several methods are reviewed here. In this paper, we investigated a fuzzy inference engine approach to identify the human trajectories based on the paths that had been modeled by a self-learning system...|$|R
