She expressed her excitement at doing so: [...] "I've adopted 34 girls. I'll be looking after their entire upbringing from education to food, clothes etc. You've no idea <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> feels to hear the excited chatter of all these girls together." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel lets Finn (Cory Monteith) {{know that}} she is {{interested}} in having sex with him, but he balks when she admits her reason {{is to be a}} better Maria. Later, she asks advice from the other girls in the show. While Santana and Quinn (Dianna Agron) both urge her not to have sex with Finn, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) reveals that she and Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) had sex over the summer and says <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> was with the boy she loved—her words are intercut with Rachel and Santana singing [...] "I Have a Love" [...] in rehearsal. Mike's father (Keong Sim) confronts him about his participation in the musical, and Mike tells him {{he wants to be a}} professional dancer, not a doctor. His father disowns him.|$|E
500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E

He played his own compositions- very original and beautiful pieces. As part of his affection for the music of Thelonious Monk, he played a fantastic and full-of-humour version of Pannonica- which probably would get Monk's approval on the spot!“ (Ben Shalev) ...|$|R

Emma is {{reluctant}} at first, but decides that maybe Vincent is right, and runs off with him. ("The Sport of Kings") The opposing team's fast bowler, Winston B.

2500|$|In Cántico, {{there were}} many poems about {{awakening}} and <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> is to return into consciousness. [...] In Clamor, dawn brings a desire to sink back into sleep and find oblivion. [...] "Del trascurso" [...] compares with [...] "Muerte a lo lejos" [...] from Cántico {{and not just because}} both poems are sonnets. [...] In the earlier poem, death was somewhere in the future and life was to be enjoyed. [...] In the later poem, the poet looks back to his past where the good memories are. [...] He then clings to the present but cannot avoid the sense of a future that is shrinking every day.|$|E

5000|$|Moravian Brethren Mission House or Herrnhut House (Herrnhuthuset) is a {{historical}} building in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, established in 1747 from timber shipped to the United Brethren from the Netherlands. It was {{the centre of the}} Moravian Brethren Mission in Greenland and the missionaries operated across the west coast of Greenland from this building. Greenlander converts were reported saying, [...] "If it can be so beautiful here on Earth, <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> must <b>it</b> not be in Heaven." ...|$|R

There were {{inaccessible}} ledges that haunted {{her with}} their remote fastnesses. <b>How</b> <b>wonderful</b> would <b>it</b> {{be to get}} there, rest there, if that were possible! But only eagles could reach them. There were places, then, that the desecrating hands of man could not touch. The dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant {{staring out at the}} world beneath them. The crumbling crags, the toppling ledges, the leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering down at the breath of wind. How deep and soft the red color in contrast with the green! How splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps! Carley found herself marveling at the forces that had so rudely, violently, and grandly left this monument to nature.|$|R

It {{was one of the}} quiet, colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in October in New England, and as I looked towards the fields at the east, I imagined <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars. I was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended for existence at last seemed very purposive." [...] (Written later, in an autobiographical sketch) ...|$|E

When she {{was four years}} old, she heard a woman reading a poem at a village concert making people laugh. The {{following}} Christmas, after being {{asked if she could}} [...] "do anything", Sugden read this poem and everyone fell about laughing. She later remarked that their response made her [...] "realise <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> was to make people laugh". Shortly after she left school, World War II broke out, and Sugden worked in a munitions factory in Keighley making shells for the Royal Navy. She was later made redundant, and attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London.|$|E

500|$|Sir David Attenborough was an {{inspiration}} to Irwin, according to his widow. When presenting a Lifetime Achievement Award to Attenborough after Irwin's death at the British National Television Awards on 31 October 2006, Terri Irwin said, [...] "If there's one person who directly inspired my husband it's the person being honoured tonight.... real, true love was conservation – {{and the influence of}} tonight's recipient in preserving the natural world has been immense."

6000|$|But {{by degrees}} he ceased {{to think of}} the woman and began {{to think of the}} client, as he was in duty bound to do. What was the real truth of all this? Was it {{possible}} that she should be alarmed in that way because a small country attorney had told his wife that he had found some old paper, and because the man had then gone off to Yorkshire? Nothing could be more natural than her anxiety, supposing her to be aware of some secret which would condemn her if discovered;--but nothing more unnatural if there were no such secret. And she must know! In her bosom, if in no other, must exist the knowledge whether or no that will were just. If that will were just, was it possible that she should now tremble so violently, seeing that its justice had been substantially proved in various courts of law? But if it were not just--if it were a forgery, a forgery made by her, or with her cognizance--and that now this truth was to be made known! How terrible would that be! But terrible is not the word which best describes the idea as it entered Mr. Furnival's mind. <b>How</b> <b>wonderful</b> would <b>it</b> be; <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> would <b>it</b> all have been! By whose hand in such case had those signatures been traced? Could it be possible that she, soft, beautiful, graceful as she was now, all but a girl as she had then been, could have done it, unaided,--by herself?--that she could have sat down in the still hour of the night, with that old man on one side and her baby in his cradle on the other, and forged that will, signatures and all, in such a manner as to have carried her point for twenty years,--so skilfully as to have baffled lawyers and jurymen and resisted the eager greed of her cheated kinsman? If so, was <b>it</b> not all <b>wonderful!</b> Had not she been a woman worthy of wonder! ...|$|R

6000|$|Having traversed this {{roundabout}} pathway, we {{now come}} to the explanation which we intended to have given much earlier in this chapter. But <b>it</b> is really <b>wonderful</b> <b>how</b> natural <b>it</b> is for the human mind to prose and to diverge, and how very difficult it is, at any time, {{to come to the}} point!

Luckily, the engineer had a two-track running, and that is what’s on the record - the first time we played through the piece.|$|R
5000|$|The Chapter 2 {{opens with}} a praise and wonders of Khechari knowledge, with the {{assertion}} that [...] "one who has mastered this, is devoid of aging and mortality" [...] and free from the suffering from diseases. The word Khechari means [...] "transversing the ethereal regions", and the text dedicates first 16 verses of the chapter stating how difficult <b>it</b> is, <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> and miraculous <b>it</b> is, how even experts fail in it, how secret this knowledge is, how even a hundred rebirths are insufficient for mastering Khechari-Vidya.

500|$|Steve and Terri {{spent their}} honeymoon {{trapping}} crocodiles together. Film footage of their honeymoon, taken by John Stainton, {{became the first}} episode of The Crocodile Hunter. The series debuted on Australian TV screens in 1996, and made its way onto North American television the following year. The Crocodile Hunter became successful in the United States, the UK, and over 130 other countries, reaching 500 million people. Irwin's exuberant and enthusiastic presenting style, broad Australian accent, signature khaki shorts, and catchphrase [...] "Crikey!" [...] became known worldwide.

6000|$|There {{was much}} more of it, but the upshot was,--as the Colonel had {{intended}} that it should be,--that Lady Albury was made to understand that Ayala's good-will was essential to his happiness. [...] "Of course I will do my best," [...] she said, as he parted from her. [...] "Though I am not quite as much {{in love with her}} myself as you are, yet I will do my best." [...] Then when she was left alone, and was prosecuting her inquiries about the new cook, and travelling back in the afternoon to Stalham, she again considered <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> a thing <b>it</b> was such a girl as Ayala, so small, apparently so unimportant, so childish in her manner, with so little to say for herself, should become a person of such terrible importance.|$|R

5000|$|I was {{overcome}} by the mighty fulness of power and went down under it. For three hours He wrought wonderfully in me. My body was worked in sections, a section at a time. And even the skin on my face was jerked and shaken, and finally I felt my lower jaw begin to quiver in a strange way. This continued for some little time, when finally my throat began to enlarge and I felt my vocal organs being, as it were, drawn into a different shape. O <b>how</b> strange and <b>wonderful</b> <b>it</b> was! and <b>how</b> blessed {{it was to be}} thus in the hands of God. And last of all I felt my tongue begin to move and my lips to produce strange sounds which did not originate in my mind.|$|R

Although {{it had been}} rehearsed only once, the Committee was sufficiently impressed to recommend the work to the International Society, which surprisingly turned it down for performance at its festival. The first public performance was scheduled for January 10, 1931. Ives himself attended - in fact, he was funding the concert himself. The performance received mild applause, and Ives congratulated the performers backstage - [...] "Just like a town meeting - every man for himself. <b>Wonderful</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> came out!".|$|R
60|$|A word or {{two more}} {{concerning}} this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. <b>How</b> <b>wonderful</b> is <b>it</b> then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable {{as it is to}} man; <b>how</b> <b>wonderful</b> that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.|$|R
