5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the DVI Specification.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 {{and prior}} to the final design of the XO-1 hardware, OLPC {{received}} criticism because of concerns over the environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in most computers. The OLPC asserted that it aimed to use as many environmentally friendly materials as it could; that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories would be <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS); and that the laptop would use {{an order of magnitude}} less power than the typical consumer netbooks available as of 2007 thus minimizing the environmental burden of power generation.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to be <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect exFAT on cards larger than 32GB. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device {{supports}} FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the host device. This bears a risk of accidental loss of data, as a host device may treat a card with an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and reformat the card.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, Alexander Sukhorukov, who {{was then}} deputy Defense Minister, said that the armored vehicle BMD-4M {{does not meet the}} {{requirements}} put forward by the Russian military department, and will not be purchased. At the same time a week before, Vladimir Shamanov said the BMD-4M is <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the VDV, which was more important in this regard than the requirements of the Ministry of Defence. He stressed that the fate of the BMD-4M is decided by the supreme commander Vladimir Putin. The Russian Army received another prototype batch of the modernised BMD-4M airborne assault vehicle during mid-2014. Eight modernized BMD-4M vehicles were delivered to the 106th Guards Airborne Assault Division by Kurganmashzavod, where the vehicles continued to undergo testing.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who get better and then get worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they should be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E
25|$|The A600 is {{the first}} of only two Amiga models to feature a PCMCIA Type II interface. This {{connector}} allows use of a number of compatible peripherals available for the laptop-computer market, though only 16-bit (Type II) PCMCIA cards are hardware-compatible; newer 32-bit CardBus or PC Card peripherals are incompatible. The port is not <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the PCMCIA Type II standard as the A600 was developed before the standard was finalized. The PCMCIA implementation on the A600 is almost identical to the one featured on a later Amiga, the 1200. A number of Amiga peripherals were released by third-party developers for this connector including SRAM cards, CD-ROM controllers, SCSI controllers, network cards, sound samplers, and video-capture devices. Although PCMCIA was similar in spirit to Commodore's expansion architecture for its earlier systems, the intended capability for convenient external expansion through this connector was largely unrealized at the time of release because of the prohibitive expense of PCMCIA peripherals for a lower-budget personal computer. Later, a number of compatible laptop-computer peripherals have been made to operate with the A600, including network cards (both wired and wireless), serial modems and CompactFlash adapters.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{stumbling}} block was thatdespite being a <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> MS-DOS systemit was not {{compatible with the}} IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as {{anything more than a}} simple program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.|$|E

25|$|The same {{law also}} {{modified}} the provisions on the copyright of foreign works. It added an article 5(4) {{to the law}} that defined that a foreign work was eligible to copyright in Russia if its copyright had not expired in the source country and it had not fallen into the public domain in Russia through the expiry of its copyright term. Previously, foreign works published before May 27, 1973, when the USSR had joined the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), had not been copyrighted {{at all in the}} Soviet Union or in Russia, even after Russia had joined the Berne Convention in 1995. When Russia had signed the Berne Convention, it had made a reservation regarding article 18 of the Berne Convention by stating that it would not consider the Berne Convention applicable to any works in the public domain in Russia. Foreign pre-1973 works thus remained uncopyrighted in Russia, although they should have become subject to copyright according to article 18(2) of the Berne Convention because that article only exempted works that once were copyrighted, but on which that copyright already had expired, which didn't apply to pre-1973 foreign works in Russia. Russia faced severe criticism for this, especially from Western countries. The new article 5(4) of the Russian copyright law was supposed to resolve the situation by restoring copyright on such foreign works and making Russia's copyright law <b>fully</b> <b>compliant</b> with the Berne Convention. Nevertheless, the common practice in Russia did not change; pre-1973 foreign works were still commonly considered to be uncopyrighted in Russia due to this reservation.|$|E
