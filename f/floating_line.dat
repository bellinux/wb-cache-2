60|$|Mulford had next {{an anxious}} duty to perform. Throughout {{the whole of}} the {{preceding}} day he had seen the air escaping from the hull, in an incessant succession of small bubbles, which were formidable through their numbers, if not through their size. The mate was aware that this unceasing loss of the buoyant property of the wreck, must eventually lead to their destruction, should no assistance come, and he had marked the <b>floating</b> <b>line,</b> {{on the bottom of the}} vessel with his knife, ere darkness set in, on the previous evening. No sooner did his thoughts recur to this fact, after the excitement of the first hour of daylight was over, than he stepped to the different places thus marked, and saw, with an alarm that it would be difficult to describe, that the wreck had actually sunk into the water several inches within the last few hours. This was, indeed, menacing their security in a most serious manner, setting a limit to their existence, which rendered all precaution on the subject of food and water useless. By the calculations of the mate, the wreck could not float more than eight-and-forty hours, should it continue to lose the air at the rate at which it had been hitherto lost. Bad as all this appeared, things were fated to become much more serious. The motion of the water quite sensibly increased, lifting the wreck at times in a way greatly to increase the danger of their situation. The reader will understand this movement did not proceed from the waves of the existing wind, but from what is technically called a ground-swell, or the long, heavy undulations that are left by the tempest that is past, or by some distant gale. The waves of the present breeze were not very formidable, the reef making a lee; though they might possibly become inconvenient from breaking on the weather side of the wreck, as soon as the drift carried the latter fairly abreast of the passage already mentioned. But the dangers that proceeded from the heavy ground-swell, which now began to give a considerable motion to the wreck, will best explain itself by narrating the incidents as they occurred.|$|E

To avoid sea turtle bycatch, {{we developed a}} mid-water float system, which is a method of setting the longline hooks at almost the same depth. When enough long <b>float</b> <b>line</b> was deployed with the mid-water float system (the mid-F system), all hooks could be set in water deeper than where sea turtle predominantly forage and in the depth of tuna habitat.

40|$|Different {{electromagnetic}} reflection {{methods can}} operate from satellites, airplanes or ground vehicles {{to illuminate the}} surface and the inside of ice sheets across varying spatial scales. The backscattered signal is formed by micro-physical ice properties, many of which in turn are influenced by mechanisms operating on a macro-scale: the alignment of crystal orientation fabric (COF) depends on the specific strain regime and the initial impurity loading; the pattern in internal layering is imprinted by accumulation and the surrounding flow regime; {{the brightness of the}} bottom reflection over ice-shelves depends on the melting or refreezing of platelet ice which is susceptible to changing ocean currents and grounding line positions. The study is subdivided in five chapters which have been or will be published separately. All studies focus on the link between these small-scale features and their large-scale expressions. The synthesis of the different methods improves the capability of remote sensing to deliver variables from which {{the current state of the}} cryosphere can be determined. The study contributes to assimilating geophysical data into the coming generation of ice-dynamic models which improve the understanding of ice-sheet histories and prognose their future behaviour. The starting point is the appearance of the radio-echo free zone (EFZ), which is a feature-less band observed above the ice [...] bed interface in many radargrams across Greenland and Antarctica. The comparison of the EFZ onset with optical ice-core images yields a connection between the mm-cm scale disturbances in the core's stratigraphy and the disappearance of radar reflection horizons. This is evidence that ice flow can disturb internal ice layering, which hampers the derivation of a coherent age [...] depth scale and indicates a changing flow behaviour with depth. A polarimetric radar survey in the same study area shows that backscattered power varies with the horizontal orientation of the antennas (i. e. with the polarization plane). Extrema in backscatter for a constant antenna angle change in direction at 900 ~m depth. By using different scattering models I differentiate between competing mechanisms for the observed anisotropy, namely a vertically varying COF or ellipsoidal air bubbles. The analysis suggests that the effect from a varying COF is superior. Radar polarimetry thus is capable to infer the principal components of COF, and with it the principal components of the corresponding stress [...] strain regime. Potentially, the different modes in COF variations are related to climate signals. The detection of anisotropic COF is an important factor in terms of anisotropic ice flow, which in turn influences the shape in internal layering especially near ice divides. The third study combines satellite data and GPS measurements with airborne and ground-based radar surveys to characterize a potential drill site with respect to internal layering, accumulation, and the topography of surface and bedrock. Particular attention is given to the upwarping of internal layering beneath the divides, which is a consequence of a nonlinear and anisotropic rheology. All datasets are used as input for a two-dimensional, anisotropic flow model which estimates an age [...] depth distribution. Likely, ice from the last glacial is present at larger depths. Ice at intermediate depths seems suitable for studies targeting the last few thousand years. Based on the structure of internal layering, the ice divides and the surrounding flow regime were stable over the last 10 000 years. The investigated ice ridge is surrounded by ice shelves. Surface velocities as well as the transition of grounded and floating ice are mapped from satellite images. This is used in the last two studies. In a collaborative project, the most landward freely <b>floating</b> <b>line</b> of ice shelves, and the most seaward line where ice flow is still influenced by the bedrock are mapped from optical satellite imagery around the Antarctic perimeter. The simultaneous derivation of coastal elevation as a basis for the derivation of flow velocities is a starting point for mass balance estimates, in which ice flow, but also sub-ice shelf melting are important parameters. The latter is treated in a case study. Using the continuity equation in a steady-state approximation, it is possible to spatially map the sub-ice shelf melt rates. A new approach is presented which circumnavigates the interpolation of ice-thickness data by applying the continuity equation only along profile lines...|$|E
