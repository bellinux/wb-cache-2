500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; he {{was there}} to give his daughters a holiday during the manoeuvres; and they made the most of it. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go to the parade with his family but we declined. The twins were pretty nearly the death of General Triscoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, but he frightened us so! He {{danced around}} us and caught us by the arms, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> give him money! Oh, it was dreadful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{the wind}} is setting inshore {{moderately}} fresh, and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come off before it roughens the water," [...] said Nasmyth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{come back}} and help pull him out," [...] {{answered}} Dave, and sounded a reply {{to show that he}} had heard the call of distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not more 'n {{three or}} four days. I'm expectin' word from Bimbel as soon as I reach the Junction, and then I'll know just what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{heard him}} grumble over my happy anticipation. Jim laughed {{and so did}} the Navajo, which made me suspect that he could {{understand}} more English than <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> suppose.|$|R
5000|$|Then, Richard took over, and said: <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> put {{together}} a medley of his songs; any tunes of his {{that we wanted to}} do, and it took a couple of months. We arrived at 8 tunes.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing at}} a time then. Let us by all means be convivial. Only you must show me how," [...] Mrs. Dallow went on to Nick. [...] "What does he mean, Cousin Agnes? Does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> drain the wine-cup, to flash with repartee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as I thought," [...] {{continued}} Shep. [...] "And {{just what}} I told my father. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go out, you know," [...] and Shep's eyes began to twinkle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{just where}} you are," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Before we do {{anything}} else, we must know what Captain Horn intends to do, and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's from Uncle Randolph. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{come home}} at once. He says -- but read it for yourselves," [...] and the elder Rover handed over the message, which ran as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you}} that nothing but entire rest would cure you. I know it's dreadfully hard, but we'll all help you; I'll read all day long, and lead you, and wait upon you, {{and try to make}} it easier." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘Remembering what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be - {{his pride}} {{in what has}} been done well, his indulgence for what has been done less well - we must go forward, humbly, but confidently, in the work of making his vision a reality.’James Herbert Simpson, {{founding}} Headmaster of Rendcomb College ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{paddling}} up, {{he told us}} that a canoe {{had arrived}} overnight, from Papeetee, with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked my}} father that, and he said most likely by next Monday. He will want to give us all some {{instructions}} before we leave. And <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> read this book," [...] and Shep drew a small volume from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's comin' up yer to-night, bringin' {{a friend}} of his--a patient that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> board and keep for three weeks until he's well agin," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Rivers. [...] "Ye know how the doctor used to rave about the pure air on our hill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you know, papa," [...] she said, in a whisper, [...] "cousin {{told me that}} God {{wants to}} have us; and he gives us everything, you know; and it isn't much to do it, if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to.</b> It isn't so very {{tiresome}} after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the pack}} are out," [...] said Leo grimly, [...] "and Rassen {{has brought a}} second mount with him.

5000|$|The band is {{not named}} after a real town in Alaska. According to Diers, King [...] "came up with the name ... before we even {{starting}} playing together, actually," [...] and felt {{that the combination of}} the two words was [...] "evocative of some of the moods and textures <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be looking at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I like better, though I'd be very sorry {{to lose my}} report. It's the fun of telling Ed I tried <b>to</b> do as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to,</b> and seeing how pleased he'll be," [...] added Jack, rather bashfully, for the boys laughed at him {{sometimes}} for his love of this friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't do it. All I {{can say is}} this: he {{believes}} mother is honest, and that she has some strange power. He will defend her in court; but he intends to study into the whole business very closely, and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> help him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks like <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{keep out}} of the fight," [...] replied Jean, thoughtfully. [...] "Maybe, though ... Dad's no fool. Colmor, you wait here till I get out of sight. I'll go round an' come up as close as {{advisable}} behind Greaves's store. You take the right side. An' keep hid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope not, indeed, I hope not. Only <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> get {{the good}} society manners and tone--like your cousins, you know. You are young enough for it, {{and a real}} Egremont, you know Nuttie, {{and when you have}} learnt it, he will trust you there,' said the mother, making a very mild version of his speech about the umbrella-mongers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vernon's a good sort {{and more}} fastidious than one thinks; he saw he'd {{be forced to}} venture on rather awkward ground, {{and there was some}} doubt. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> weigh the story and judge if the clew he gave <b>us</b> ought <b>to</b> be followed. This was not Vernon's job, {{although}} I think he was satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I met Will Morrison in New York, Hannah," [...] {{he said to}} his wife. [...] "He {{was just}} sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> occupy his {{mountain}} place, Hillcrest Lodge, during July and August, and although I told him we couldn't use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{said the}} child, with her insolent, high-pitched superiority, [...] "It's some money that <b>he</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> know about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] she told him, [...] "I {{was looking for a}} taxicab. I have had a {{telegram}} from Ralph. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go down to Portsmouth by the first train we can catch this morning. He says that if we can get down there in time to have lunch at two o'clock, he can show us over the Scorpion. After to-day she will be closed to visitors, even his own relations. I was just going to see if Geraldine could come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} {{tell me what}} he has said, {{and what it is}} <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do. For your sake, if you ask us, Miss Mackenzie, we'll do anything. We'll sell the coats off our backs, if you wish it. You shall never lose one {{shilling}} by Rubb and Mackenzie as long as I {{have anything to do with}} the firm. But I'm sure you will excuse me if I say that we can do nothing at the bidding of that old cormorant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Vittoria, Salamanca, Toulouse, Waterloo, Moodkee, Ferozshah, an' Sobraon--that {{was fought}} close next door here, against the very beggars <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> join. Inkermann, The Alma, Sebastopol! What are those little {{businesses}} {{compared to the}} campaigns of General Mulcahy? The Mut'ny, think o' that; the Mut'ny an' some dirty little matters in Afghanistan; an' for that an' these an' those'--Dan pointed to the names of glorious battles--'that Yankee man with the partin' in his hair comes an' says as easy as [...] "have a drink."...

5000|$|The song won many fans, {{including}} the pro-wrestler-turned-politician, Jesse Ventura. Bunnell recalled, [...] "We went and played at Governor Jesse Ventura's inaugural out in Minneapolis. He asked <b>us</b> <b>to</b> — {{his wife is}} a horse lady, and she'd always loved 'A Horse with No Name', and he had adopted this name Ventura. So when he put together his cast of characters for his big inaugural celebration, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come and play two songs, which we did".|$|R
6000|$|... "And didn't {{you like}} it," [...] broke in Amy, [...] "when {{he said that}} was not what God asked of <b>us?</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be like the wheat, or the vine, or the apple, or the strawberry, some plain in blossom, some fair and lovely to look at, but valued for the fruit they bring forth, not selfishly, just to keep up their own stock, but for the support and joy and blessing of all!" ...|$|R
5000|$|They'd {{recorded}} [...] "Spanish Blue" [...] {{when the}} spectre of the Gudinski organisation loomed, {{and they were}} summoned to the Mushroom/White Citadel. Gudinski liked [...] "Spanish Blue". 'It was just that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> re-write it, and re-mix it,' McComb laughs. 'We ended up putting it out ourselves immediately they started dilly dallying because we said we wouldn't re-mix it. We thought that we couldn't just wait for people to decide {{what they wanted to}} do.' ...|$|R
