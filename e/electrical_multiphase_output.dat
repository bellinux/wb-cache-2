Thus, this paper introduces the graphical phasor diagram method in designing the multiphase transformer connection. The proposed method eases the design process of the static multiphase transformer that produces <b>multiphase</b> <b>output</b> from the standard three phase input. The transformer connection was simulated in ANSYS Maxwell and the multiphase waveform with appropriate phase angle was obtained. The design of five-phase transformer using graphical phasor and simulation results from the finite elements software are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{extensive}} analysis of multiphase LC oscillators. N oscillators coupled {{in a ring}} topology can generate <b>multiphase</b> <b>outputs.</b> For their nature, these oscillators operate off-resonance and consequently their phase noise worsens at increasing coupling strength. Since the coupling transistors raise the total power consumption, the noise-power product degrades even more {{with respect to a}} stand-alone oscillator. On the other hand, at high coupling factors, component mismatches affect less the phase accuracy. Closed-form expressions for phase noise and phase accuracy are derived which are verified against circuit simulations...|$|R

A phase error averaging circuit is used to correct interphase errors. The multiphase clock generator has been fabricated in a standard 0. 35 μm, 3. 3 V CMOS process.

Self-timed rings (STR) are promising approach for designing high-speed serial links and clock generators.

Moreover, this architecture allows us 3 dB phase noise reduction when, while keeping the same frequency, when the stage number is doubled. In this chapter, we propose a method to design STR able to generate high-speed multi-phase outputs and we suggest a design flow for designing low-phase noise self-timed ring oscillators.

40|$|The {{design of}} a direct {{time-of-flight}} complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (dToF-CIS) based on a single-photon avalanche-diode (SPAD) array with an in-pixel time-to-digital converter (TDC) must contemplate system-level aspects that affect its overall performance. This paper provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the impact of process parameters, voltage supply, and temperature (PVT) variations on the time bin of the TDC array. Moreover, the design and characterization of a global compensation loop is presented. It is based on a phase locked loop (PLL) that is integrated on-chip. The main building block of the PLL is a voltage-controlled ring-oscillator (VCRO) that is identical to the ones employed for the in-pixel TDCs. The reference voltage that drives the master VCRO is distributed to the voltage control inputs of the slave VCROs such that their <b>multiphase</b> <b>outputs</b> become invariant to PVT changes. These outputs act as time interpolators for the TDCs. Therefore the compensation scheme prevents the time bin of the TDCs from drifting over time due to the aforementioned factors. Moreover, the same scheme is used to program different time resolutions of the direct time-of-flight (ToF) imager aimed at 3 D ranging or depth map imaging. Experimental results that validate the analysis are provided as well. The compensation loop proves to be remarkably effective. The spreading of the TDCs time bin is lowered from: (i) 20 % down to 2. 4 % while the temperature ranges from 0 °C to 100 °C; (ii) 27 % down to 0. 27 %, when the voltage supply changes within ± 10 % of the nominal value; (iii) 5. 2 ps to 2 ps standard deviation over 30 sample chips, due to process parameters’ variation...|$|R
40|$|Circuit {{and system}} {{techniques}} for reducing phase noise in frequency synthesizers, and cancelling phase noise effect in quadrature receivers are presented. Phase noise performance of digital phase-locked loops (PLLs) {{is limited by}} the time resolution of time-to-digital converters (TDC). In contrast to TDCs in the past that concentrate on the arrival time difference between the divider feedback edge and the reference signal edge. Our approach extracts the timing information that is embedded in voltage domain. This approach not only achieves a higher time resolution, lower phase noise, but also consumes less power. A digital background calibration circuit is also presented to reduce the output spurious tones when the digital PLL operates under fractional-N divisions. Ring Oscillators (ROs) have the advantage of small area, wide tuning range, and <b>multiphase</b> <b>output.</b> However, their higher phase noise and higher sensitivity to supply noise may seriously deteriorate the wanted signal in wireless receivers. To circumvent this non-ideality, a low overhead phase noise cancellation technique for ring oscillator-based quadrature receivers is presented. The proposed technique operates in background and extracts ring oscillator phase noise as well as supply-induced phase noise from the digital PLL. The obtained phase noise information is then used to restore the randomly rotated baseband signal in digital domain. In recent years, the unsilenced band at 57 ~ 64 GHz frequency range has motivated the building of high-data rate radio systems targeting wireless personal area network (WPAN) applications. To address this demand, a low-noise wide-band integer-N PLL is presented which serves as the carrier generator of a 60 GHz heterogeneous transceiver. The PLL employs sub-sampling phase detection technique to achieve low-noise performance, and provides 48 GHz LO and 12 GHz IF carrier signals for the heterogeneous transceiver...|$|R

40|$|Project Final Report for " 100 kW Energy Transfer Multiplexer Power Converter Prototype Development Project" {{prepared}} under DOE grant number DE-FG 36 - 03 GO 13138. This project {{relates to}} the further development and prototype construction/evaluation for the Energy Transfer Multiplexer (ETM) power converter topology concept. The ETM uses a series resonant link to transfer energy from any phase of a multiphase input to any phase of a <b>multiphase</b> <b>output,</b> converting any input voltage and frequency to any output voltage and frequency. The basic form of the ETM converter consists of an eight (8) -switch matrix (six phase power switches and two ground power switches) and a series L-C resonant circuit. Electronic control of the switches allows energy to be transferred in the proper amount from any phase to any other phase. Depending upon the final circuit application, the switches may be either SCRs or IGBTs. The inherent characteristics of the ETM converter include the following: Power processing in either direction (bidirectional); Large voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics; High efficiency independent of output load and frequency; Wide bandwidth with fast transient response and; Operation as a current source. The ETM is able to synthesize true sinusoidal waveforms with low harmonic distortions. For a low power PM wind generation system, the ETM has the following characteristics and advantages: It provides voltage gain without the need of low frequency magnetics (DC inductors) and; It has constant high efficiency independent of the load. The ETM converter can be implemented into a PM wind power system with smaller size, reduced weight and lower cost. As {{a result of our}} analyses, the ETM offers wind power generation technology for the reduction of the cost and size as well as the increase in performance of low power, low wind speed power generation. This project is the further theoretical/analytical exploration of the ETM converter concept in relationship to PM wind power generator applications in the 100 kW and under power range. The theoretical/analytical and bench scale work focuses on simplifying the basic ETM converter topology (in terms of parts count and complexity) for the specific application of the low power PM system. The project goals and objectives were for Spellman HV will develop a 100 kW prototype ETM power converter based on paralleled lower ratings converters. The proposed configuration of this prototype is a 100 kW rated converter comprised of four (4) 34 kW rated modules connected in parallel (the fourth converter is included to demonstrate N+ 1 fault tolerance). This approach is more viable as there is lower technological risk involved in developing a 34 kW-rated converter than a single 100 kW unit. The modular system approach should have a lower deployment and service cost over a single unit system, because of the economics of scale (smaller units at a higher volume means lower manufacturing cost) and because of improved serviceability (a non-redundant power system with one failed module will still operate at a lower power level). There is also the added benefit that greater commercial application and acceptance should be achieved by having a modular system available in which fault tolerance (N+ 1 or 2 N) is a feature. This modular approach would allow the output power to be increased by adding more paralleled converters. Thus, the maximum output power of the overall power system {{is a function of the}} interconnection medium (the hot swap connection subsystem), rather than the ratings of a single module. The project was implemented with Spellman HV acting as the program management and production assembly and test facility; The Baker Company acting as a technical consultant and resource when required; and dtm Associates acting as the design/development resource for the hardware development of the 100 kW ETM converter prototype...|$|R

40|$|The best {{candidate}} {{materials for the}} novel solar absorber should possess a combination of properties including appropriate absorbance, good electrical conductivity and resistance to oxidation in air. Porous SiC and dense SiC were rejected for several reasons. Porous SiC has a proper absorbance but no electrical conductivity and poor mechanical strength. Dense SiC has modest absorbance and poor <b>electrical</b> conductivity. The <b>multiphase</b> composites, SiC-MoSi 2, AlN-SiC-MoSi 2 have a better combination of properties, that can be tailored through compositional rearrangement of the constituent phases. Moreover, they have a superior oxidation resistance thanks {{to the development of}} a silica-based protective layer. HfC-MoSi 2 have a good absorbance, but too high reflectance and poor resistance to oxidation. Results of the optical properties measurements suggest to reduce the amount of secondary phases such as MoSi 2, basically for two reasons: -	as MoSi 2 behaves like a sintering aid, reduction of its volumetric content hinders complete elimination of porosity during sintering. Residual porosity seems to increase the material 2 ̆ 7 s absorbance. -	MoSi 2 can increase the material 2 ̆ 7 s reflectance, especially for matrices such as SiC and AlN. On this basis, the activity has concentrated on the design of optimized compositions with a lower content of MoSi 2.

40|$|Electrical tomography, e. g. {{electrical}} resistance tomography (ERT) and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), {{has been successfully}} applied to many industries for measuring and visualising multiphase flow. This research aims to investigate the data fusion and visualisation technologies with electrical tomography as the key data processing tools of a platform for multiphase flow characterisation. Gas-oil-water flow is a common flow in the gas and oil industries but still presents challenges in understanding its complex dynamics. This research systematically studied the data fusion and visualisation technologies using dual-modality electrical tomography (ERT-ECT). Based on a general framework, two data fusion methods, namely threshold and fuzzy logic with decision tree, were developed to quantify and qualify the flow. The experimental results illustrated the feasibility of the methods integrated with the framework to visualise and measure flows in six typical common flow regimes, including stratified, wavy stratified, slug, plug, annular, and bubble flow. In addition, the performance of ERT-ECT was also evaluated. A 3 D visualisation approach, namely Bubble Mapping, was proposed to transform concentration distribution to individual bubbles. With a bubble-based lookup table and enhanced isosurface algorithms, the approach overcomes {{the limits of the}} conventional concentration tomograms in visualisation of bubbles with sharp boundaries between gas and liquid, providing sophisticated flow dynamic information. The experiments proved that Bubble Mapping is able to visualise typical flow regimes in different pipeline orientations. Two sensing methods were proposed, namely asymmetrical sensing and imaging (ASI) and regional imaging with limited measurement (RILM), to improve the precision of the velocity profile derived from the cross-correlation method by enhancing ERT sensing speed, which is particularly helpful for industrial flows that their disperse phase velocity is very high, e. g. 20 m/s of the gas phase.
