5|$|When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was {{in danger}} of {{extinction}} after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent played a major part in saving <b>it,</b> <b>doing</b> much to win back the good opinion of orchestral players that Sargent had lost because of his 1936 interview. In the 1960s, Sargent toured Russia, the United States, Canada, Turkey, Israel, India, the Far East and Australia. By the mid-1960s his health began to deteriorate. His final conducting appearances were on 6 and 8 July 1967, leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival. On 6 July Sargent conducted Holst's The Perfect Fool, Henryk Wieniawski's Second Violin Concerto with Itzhak Perlman, and Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony. On 8 July he led Vaughan Williams's Overture to The Wasps, Delius's The Walk to the Paradise Garden, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 4 with David Bar-Illan, and Sibelius's Symphony No. 2.|$|E

2500|$|In a May 2017 {{interview}} with Rockbook, frontman James LaBrie stated that Dream Theater plans to release their fourteenth studio album in 2018. He commented: [...] "We're pretty psyched because {{we already know}} what we're gonna do. But I'm not gonna tell you. It's really important for us that the new album will be our best effort. It should be who we are at that particular moment. We still want to create something that's better than what we did before. That's what keeps you interested in what you do. But if along the way we {{feel that there is}} another album we should recognize once again, then we'll do it." [...] LaBrie also stated that the band will concentrate on [...] "one album at a time and not thinking in a concept", and added, [...] "Unless we wanna write an epic song that has multiple parts in <b>it.</b> <b>Doing</b> something like that might be cool. Something like A Change of Seasons. But a whole album again, no." [...] The album is currently slated for early 2019.|$|E
2500|$|The songs,all {{written by}} Davis herself, are mostly built around funk grooves, driving {{percussion}} and heavy guitars. Davis' vocal stylings are expressive and boisterous (as on [...] "If I'm In Luck I Might Get Picked Up"), but also playful and sensual (as on [...] "Anti Love Song"). On the former she boldly sings [...] "I'm wigglin' my fanny, I'm raunchy dancing, I'm-a-doing <b>it</b> <b>doing</b> it". [...] "Steppin' In Her I. Miller Shoes", {{tells the story}} of a talented young woman who comes to the 'jungle' with big dreams, only to end up a tragic victim of the entertainment industry. The up-tempo song features hard rock guitars and backing vocals by The Pointer Sisters. In a 2007 interview Davis revealed that the song was based on the life of Devon Wilson, a one-time girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix with whom Davis had been close friends. Wilson is also the subject of [...] "Angel" [...] by Hendrix. With their hard-funk/rock-fused sounds, few of the songs catered to radio play; perhaps the closest is [...] "In The Meantime" [...] featuring prominent organ and the most restrained and straightfoward performance on the album.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He [...] came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of <b>it,</b> <b>doing</b> Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't know what would have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of Anderson's men {{managed to}} get across the creek and {{momentarily}} threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving {{on the field and}} realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him [...] "General, what is all this army and what is <b>it</b> <b>doing</b> here?" [...] Lee replied sarcastically [...] "I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it." [...] William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were {{to the rear of the}} 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote [...] "The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford." ...|$|E
