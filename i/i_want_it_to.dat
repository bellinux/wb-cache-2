It’s only 11,500 acres, but there’s {{a lot of work to}} do – {{controlling}} brush, improving the grass. We’ve gone from 250 cows to about 400 cows and that takes some work. We’re in the heart of the Texas deer and quail country, too, so we lease out some land to hunters.|$|E

The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E

[...] The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.|$|E
500|$|... "Rather Die Young" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Beyoncé Beyoncé, Jeff Bhasker, and Luke Steele at Enormous Studios, in Los Angeles, in 2011. Cole Kamen-Green, Alex Asher and Josiah Woodson played the trumpets while Nick Videen and Drew Sayers {{were on the}} tenor and alto saxophones. The horn were arranged by Shea Taylor. Jordan Young then recorded Beyoncé's vocals at the MSR Studios and KMA Studios, in New York City; Steele and Billy Kraven served as background vocalists. Tony Maserati mixed the track, while Pete Wolford, Ryan Kelly, Serge Nudel, Justin Hergett and Jon Castelliall all assisted in the audio engineering of [...] "Rather Die Young"; both tasks were executed at the RMC Studio, in Los Angeles. Speaking about what motivated her to record a song in the vein of [...] "Rather Die Young", Beyoncé said: [...] "I really {{want people to think}} when they listen to my music. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> help them through their painful memories, their painful moments, and their most happy moments. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a conversation." ...|$|E

The actual crucifixion was more violent than what was shown on the film, but I thought no one would get anything out of it.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, I Am Very Far {{is also a}} sharp {{departure}} from their previous work. Whereas previous albums were often composed of highly literate takes on rock legends and tropes, this album's lyrics tend to portray dark and indistinct dreamscapes. Sheff explained that [...] "interiority is a really important thing to me, {{and a lot of}} this record did come from a subconscious, unconscious place, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> respond to that corresponding place in listeners... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> really feel like it was operating on a subterranean level." ...|$|R
5000|$|The bulk of Is the Is Are was {{recorded}} in March 2015 at Strange Weather Recording Studio and The Bunker Studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Regarding the recording process, Smith noted: [...] "I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound slick or over produced. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound human and homemade. And that’s the key <b>to</b> this album, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> show humanity, imperfect and flawed - the album title, the way <b>it</b> {{was recorded}}, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> every element to sound human, then hopefully people can empathise with me rather than judging me." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Lopez, Anthony had {{the idea}} to {{translate}} [...] "Non Amarmi", an [...] "old Italian song", into Spanish. Two versions of the songs were produced for On the 6, a ballad and a salsa production. The ballad was produced by Dan Shea, while the other was produced by Juan Vicente Zambrano. Lopez stated: [...] "I don't want to be straight Latin! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be more like, y'know, dance-y music-y".|$|E
500|$|Visual {{elements}} employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts {{have often}} included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation. [...] Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that [...] "I’ve adopted {{a philosophy of}} the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons.

500|$|Before the album's release, Williams {{spoke about}} his {{hopes for the}} album: [...] "I want people to feel elated, I want them to dance, I want them to forget about {{who they are and}} where they are for 50 minutes – and, within those 50 minutes of [...] forgetting who they are, I also hope people relate to the songs. This is a record that I’m very proud of – I think it’s fucking brilliant. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be the record that, if people think of Robbie Williams, they go, Yeah, Reality Killed the Video Star." [...] He also talked about his {{collaboration}} with producer Trevor Horn: [...] "He’s added something to the record that I haven’t had on previous records – his genius".|$|E
5000|$|Ecks {{said of the}} album: [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be {{too easy}} for the listener. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hurt a little bit. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> get into {{a spot in the}} head that hasn't been hit". Of its title he said [...] "The Sufi side of life has helped me with my killer side so I try not to attach myself to any label. There's a Sufi and a killer in everybody, man, and I'll be {{whatever}} I have to be just <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> through".|$|R

500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit. Coming up with the lyrics was mainly [...] I'd tell her this is how <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> go, and she would help with the lyrics, too, sometimes.

"I want {{to write}} my this-is-who-the-fuck-I-am anthem, but I don't {{want it to be}} hidden in poetic wizardry and metaphors. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, {{especially}} in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone." ...|$|E

"It's {{not really}} a tour, it's more of a {{traveling}} party. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be an entire experience from [...] minute you walk in [...] front door to [...] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's {{going to be as}} if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK.

[...] "I obviously wanted the video to be about friendship but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> communicate this in a wide and universal way. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a reflection on unity in both bright times and in dark — about standing together strong and shining the light across borders and generations." ...|$|R
500|$|Goldfaden {{wrote that}} this {{attitude}} put him [...] "pure and simply {{at war with}} the public." [...] His stage was not to be merely [...] "a masquerade"; he continued: [...] "No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E
500|$|Kunis {{began dating}} actor Macaulay Culkin in 2002. During their relationship, {{there were rumors}} of the couple getting married, but Kunis denied them. In an {{interview}} with BlackBook magazine, Kunis stated that marriage is [...] "not something that's important to me". Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that [...] "We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] When {{asked if it was}} difficult {{to stay out of the}} tabloids and press, Kunis responded: [...] "I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can." [...] Asked if that is difficult she said, [...] "I don't care. I will go to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place." [...] On January 3, 2011, Kunis' publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying [...] "The split was amicable, and they remain close friends." ...|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made {{in a way that}} Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E
2500|$|Blomkamp said {{no single}} film {{influenced}} District 9, but cited the 1980s [...] "hardcore sci-fi/action" [...] {{films such as}} Alien, Aliens, The Terminator, , Predator and RoboCop as subconscious influences.

500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{shot the}} films {{back-to-back}} {{in the beginning}} of July 2007 with Guerrilla shot first in Spain for 39 days and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days. The director conceived The Argentine as [...] "a Hollywood movie" [...] shot in widescreen 'scope aspect ratio, with the camera either fixed or moving on a dolly or a Steadicam. Guerrilla was shot, according to Soderbergh, [...] "in Super-16, 1.85:1. No dollies, no cranes, it's all either handheld or tripods. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> look nice but simple. We'll work with a very small group: basically me, the producer Gregory Jacobs and the unit production manager". According to the director, the portion set in Cuba was written from the victor's perspective and as a result he adopted a more traditional look with classical compositions, vibrant color and a warm palette. With Guerrilla, he wanted a sense of foreboding with hand-held camerawork and a muted color palette. Soderbergh told his production designer Antxon Gomez that the first part would have green with a lot of yellow in it and the second part would have green with a lot of blue in it.|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical.

I {{was going through a}} run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E
