40|$|Abstract – In a Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) domain traffic {{engineering}} (TE) {{can be performed}} using a <b>fully–meshed</b> overlay (MPLS-TE). This causes well-known scalability problems. We show here that by carrying out OSPF-TE in a MPLS domain, the scalability problems can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. More importantly, {{the time required to}} compute solutions is up to two orders of magnitude faster than schemes reliant on search or Mixed Integer Program (MIP) techniques. This gives us the capacity to react rapidly to build-ups of link congestion in the network. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{convergence}} {{speed of}} an asynchronous point-to-point {{version of the}} push-sum algorithm in sensor networks is investigated both through numerical simulations and theoretical arguments. The main contribution of the paper consists in studying the application of such algorithm in realistic scenarios, represented by non <b>fully-meshed</b> networks. Simulations show that, in this case, convergence may be strongly dependent on the adopted share factor, whose value should be optimized {{as a function of}} the connectivity level of the network. Optimum shares are derived for some common topologies, like the ring and the random geometric graph. The effect of possible link failures is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} has rapidly {{become a}} new infrastructure for organizations to reduce their capital cost in IT investment and to develop planetary-scale distributed applications. One of the fundamental challenges in geographically distributed clouds is to provide efficient algorithms for supporting intercloud data management and dissemination. In this paper, we present Plume, a generic distributed intercloud overlay for time-critical event dissemination services. Plume aims at improving the interoperability of interclouds in time-critical event dissemination services, such as computing policy updating, message sharing, event notifications and so forth. Plume organizes these distributed clouds into a novel quorum ring overlay to support a constant event dissemination latency. Our numerical {{results show that the}} proposed Plume greatly improves the efficiency as compared to a DHT-based overlay approach and provides better scalability than the <b>fully-meshed</b> approach.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the design and {{implementation}} of the BETEUS (Broadband Exchange for Trans-European Usage) communication platform. BETEUS is a project which is aiming at providing a platform for the support of tele-teaching applications. The communication platform is the part of the overall BETEUS platform that provides end-to-end connectivity between BETEUS sites. The realization of the communication platform is constrained by the services available on the European ATM pilot. Since signalling and multicast features have not been available, the BETEUS communication platform implements a pragmatic approach to overcome these shortcomings. Firstly, we utilize a <b>fully-meshed</b> network for connecting BETEUS sites. Secondly, multicast is done in the application itself. As services, both end-toend native ATM and IP connectivity are provided. The BETEUS communication platform complies with certain important application requirements such as throughput and end-to-end delay. In this paper we give more details on each of the topics raised. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a teleconferencing platform {{that was developed}} {{in the course of the}} European project Beteus. The platform features a high-level programming interface that reduces the application development effort to a minimum. Platform and applications were deployed over the European ATM pilot network between sites in Sophia-Antipolis, Lausanne, Zürich, Geneva and Berlin. One of the major problems was to make the cross-connect based ATM pilot transparent to the applications. This was achieved with a <b>fully-meshed</b> network of permanent virtual paths interconnecting the ATM LANs of the project partners. Another major problem was the provision of multicast to the applications. With the ATM pilot being a hostile environment for IP multicast, the optimum solution here was found to be sender-based multicast. The paper presents the major features of the application platform and the developed applications. It describes the network configuration and summarizes the experience gained in field [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Dual Busy Tone Multiple Access (DBTMA) {{scheme was}} {{designed}} for decentralized networks such as Packet Radio Networks (PRN's). We use the RTS/CTS dialogue to reserve the channel in DBTMA. In addition, we use two busy tones to notify neighbor nodes of the on-going transmission and reception after a successful channel reservation. Our analysis and simulations show that DBTMA provides higher network utilization, which is 100 % more than the basic RTS/CTS schemes. We present the details of our analysis in this paper. In order to evaluate our protocol in a more general network, our analysis and simulations {{are based on a}} <b>fully-meshed</b> decentralized multi-hop network topology. I. INTRODUCTION When the network span is much larger than nodal transmission range, nodes in a peer-peer network may need to use multi-hop communications. An example of multi-hop network is a Packet Radio Network (PRN). In a PRN, a single channel is shared by a number of nodes. Packet collisions are unavoidable due [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{increasing}} number of networked applications, like video conference and video-on-demand, benefit from knowledge about Internet path measures like available bandwidth. Server selection and placement of infrastructure nodes based on accurate information about network conditions help to improve the quality-of-service of these systems. Acquiring this knowledge usually requires <b>fully-meshed</b> ad-hoc measurements. These, however, introduce a large overhead and a possible delay in communication establishment. Thus, prediction-based approaches like Sequoia have been proposed, which treat path properties as a semimetric and embed them onto trees, leveraging labelling schemes to predict distances between hosts not measured before. In this paper, we identify asymmetry {{as a cause of}} serious distortion in these systems causing inaccurate prediction. We study the impact of asymmetric network conditions on the accuracy of existing tree-embedding approaches, and present direction-aware embedding, a novel scheme that separates upstream from downstream properties of hosts and significantly improves the prediction accuracy for highly asymmetric datasets. This is achieved by embedding nodes for each direction separately and constraining the distance calculation to inversely labelled nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness and trade-offs of our approach using synthetic as well as real-world datasets...|$|E

40|$|Internet Coordinate systems embed Round-Trip-Times (RTTs) between Internet nodes {{into some}} {{geometric}} space so that unmeasured RTTs {{can be estimated}} us-ing distance computation in that space. If accurate, such techniques {{would allow us to}} predict Internet RTTs with-out extensive measurements. The published techniques appear to work very well when accuracy is measured by stress or absolute relative error. However, our own expe-rience with using these algorithms has been disappoint-ing in several respects. First, results are often unpre-dictable in the sense that many nodes obtain good esti-mates while a few obtain very bad results — and in a real-world setting nodes cannot determine the quality of their estimates without doing the kind of <b>fully-meshed</b> prob-ing that Coordinates Systems are intended to eliminate. Another lack of predictability is related to scalability — how the accuracy of an embedding change as the number of participating nodes grows or shrinks. Since difficul-ties of these kinds are often ”averaged away ” by accu-racy metrics such as absolute relative error we propose several new metrics that we believe more closely cap-ture the inaccuracies that are important to many applica-tions. For example, applications may not need distances that are accurate in absolute terms, but only require that the relative distances of other nodes, while other appli-cations may require that only the closest neighbors be accurately preserved. We analyze and compare the ac-curacy of several recently proposed embedding schemes using these new metrics. The results can be very poor, even in simple tree-like networks. ...|$|E
