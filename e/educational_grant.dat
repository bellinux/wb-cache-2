25|$|In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set}} up that covered hollow ware making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and child welfare services. while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of direct taxation on the wealthy while also investing more money in social services. The <b>educational</b> <b>grant</b> was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|E
