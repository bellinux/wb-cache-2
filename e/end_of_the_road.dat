5|$|In {{the tail}} end of the 1990s, due to the parts being discontinued, the 3/5 had {{technically}} reached the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Some licensees continued to make small numbers of speakers, for a while, using re-manufactured parts. However, Stirling Broadcast, one of the last batch of licensees, completely redesigned the product based on the audio signature of the original, and launched the LS3/5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006.|$|E
5|$|Old Kent Road {{railway station}} at the {{southern}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> opened in 1866 and closed in 1917. The London City Fire Brigade opened a fire station on the road around 1868. It was subsumed into the London Fire Brigade from its formation and in 1904 {{was replaced by a}} new station which was in turn replaced by another on the corner of Coopers Road. The station was demolished for redevelopment in 2014 and reopened the following year.|$|E

Fearing an attack on the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> bridge or the Nijmegen road, a battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland, Machine Gun Battalion 47 and other Kampfgruppes headed across the river overnight.|$|E
5|$|Plagis {{stayed with}} the RAF {{following}} the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying Gloster Meteor F.3s. He was awarded the Airman's Cross by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946. After retiring from the military with the rank of wing commander, Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948. A street in the north Salisbury suburb of Alexandra Park had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits; he moved into the house at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> 1John Plagis Avenue. He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter.|$|E
5|$|The main {{attraction}} of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It {{is at the}} south-eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park. The weir {{at the bottom of}} the Waterfall was constructed in the late 19th century and was part of Adelaide's early water supply. Development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912. Developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site, upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.|$|E

5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 people. Inside Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> and the Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast {{were drawn}} {{in a group}} with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs Benin. Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over Benin, {{as well as in}} the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to be the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in the 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepparton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw Main Roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s Main Roads has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass.|$|E
50|$|Lou Rocher died in May 2013 and was remembered around Yellowknife most {{prominently}} for giving Ragged Ass Road its name.

As <b>of</b> 2015, there are city signs at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, the street, {{along with}} nearby Brick Lane became the centre of the British Bangladeshi community. The East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road was opened by Shaykh Abdullah bin Subayl in 1985 and can {{accommodate}} over 3,000 worshippers, with dedicated facilities for women. The nearby London Muslim Centre opened in 2003. Whitechapel Market caters well for the community, with stalls stocking Asian fruit and vegetables including okra and mangoes, clothing such as tunics and pashminas, and mobile phone cards for cheap long-distance calls. A racially motivated attack on local worker Altab Ali near Whitechapel Road in May 1978 was a significant event for the local Asian community, and his life is now commemorated in Altab Ali Park at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> which was built on the former St Mary's Church grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Allied advance quickly {{ran into}} trouble. The {{reconnaissance}} squadron was ambushed by the northern flank of Krafft's blocking line and withdrew. The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions were also stalled by Krafft's defences {{and spent the}} rest of the day skirting his line. The 3rd Parachute Battalion went south and halted in Oosterbeek for most of the night while 1st Parachute Battalion went further north but hit Spindler's forces and was unable to reach the Arnhem-Ede road of Leopard route. Instead Dobie decided to abandon his plan and help Frost at the bridge and the battalion headed south into Oosterbeek overnight. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion was largely unopposed, bypassing the defences that did not as yet reach down as far as the river. They were slowed by cheering Dutch civilians and did not reach the bridges until late in the day. The railway bridge was blown by German engineers as the Allies approached it and the pontoon bridge was missing its central section. At dusk, the men of A Company under Major Digby Tatham-Warter observed Gräbner's force cross the bridge. Most of the battalion and various other supporting units—including two jeeps of Gough's squadron, four 6-pounder anti-tank guns, Brigade HQ (but without Lathbury), and Royal Engineers (in total numbering about 740 men)— moved into Arnhem centre as night fell and owing to the oversight in German orders were able to secure the undefended northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> bridge. Brigade HQ was being led by Brigade Major Tony Hibbert.|$|E
