50|$|Bacteria {{have been}} {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} obstinate in this list to control. Techniques that help in minimizing bacterial colony growth within UPW streams include occasional chemical or steam sanitization (which is common in the pharmaceutical industry), ultrafiltration (found in some pharmaceutical, but mostly semiconductor industries), ozonation and optimization of piping system designs that promote the use of Reynolds Number criteria for minimum flow along with minimization of <b>dead</b> <b>legs.</b> In modern advanced UPW systems positive (higher than zero) bacteria counts are typically observed in the newly constructed facilities. This issue is effectively addressed by sanitization using ozone or hydrogen peroxide. With proper design of the polishing and distribution system no positive bacteria counts are typically detected throughout the life cycle of the UPW system.|$|E

40|$|In a subsea facility, the {{pipelines}} will {{be surrounded}} by sea water at 4 ◦C, which will actively cool the production fluid inside. If temperatures drop below a critical value, water and gas will form unwanted solids called hydrates. <b>Dead</b> <b>legs</b> are inactive parts of production pipelines occupied by stagnant hydrocarbons. These areas pose a major hydrate formation risk, {{and needs to be}} insulated based on a prior heat transfer analysis. If a dead leg contains access points for e. g remotely operated vehicles, these areas need to be kept uninsulated, and will act as cold spots. Due to internal natural convection, these cold spots will potentially influence the temperatures throughout the system, and it is therefore crucial to predict the degree of influence. In this master thesis, experimental and numerical heat transfer analysis was conducted on a T-shaped plexiglass pipe, representing a production header with a vertical dead-leg. The header was insulated, while the dead-leg was uninsulated and carried a cold spot on top. In the first of two experimental phases, water was circulated through the header at constant flow rate, mimicking steady state production. In the second phase, the flow was enclosed and the water was cooled down over a period of 3 hours. During both phases, internal and external temperatures were measured with RTD s and thermocouples respectively, while velocities in the dead leg were measured using PIV. It was shown how the mean velocity field rotated periodically in a clockwise and counter-clockwise manner during both phases. A numerical model was created in Workbench, and simulations were carried out using RANS with a k − ω SST formulation in CFX. Temperatures were correctly predicted for 3 hours of cool down, by modelling the cold spot as an isothermal wall, even though simulations failed to recreate the periodic mean velocity field observed in the experiment...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the most effective disinfection protocol to reduce the presence of Legionella pneumophila in the water system of two Italian hospitals. From 2004 to 2009, 271 samplings of hot water were carried out in 11 hospital units to detect the presence of L. pneumophila. Additionally, water samples collected from one boiler outlet and the hot water recirculation were tested. From 2004 to 2009, L. pneumophila was present in 37 % of the samples. Of these, 68. 3 % and 18. 8 % were positive for serogroups 2 - 14 and 1, respectively. Furthermore, 12. 9 % of the samples were positive for both serogroups. Finally, a maximal count of 10 (4) CFU/L was measured in the most distal sites. To reduce L. pneumophila colonization, a two-year long hyperchlorination (2004 - 2006) was carried out. Moreover, from June 2005 until now, continuous maintenance of boilers and tanks, substitution of the shower heads and increase of the boiler outlet temperature to 60 ºC were performed. All these treatments led to a marked reduction of L. pneumophila colonization in the short but not in the medium-long term. Only the use of chlorine dioxide led, after four years, to a reduction of the loads of L. pneumophila to values below 100 CFU/L. However, in the distal sites a persistent degree of colonization (maximum value 700 CFU/L, average 600 CFU/L) was observed probably due to the presence of L. pneumophila in the stagnant water in <b>dead</b> <b>legs.</b> In conclusion, data show that long-term chlorination of hot water sources together with carefully aimed maintenance of water pipes can lead to an effective reduction of L. pneumophila concentration in hospital water systems...|$|E
40|$|High {{pure water}} systems {{are used in}} {{pharmaceutical}} and chemical industries. Deadlegs are generally found at points of use in distribution systems. The FDA suggests that the 6 D rule is sufficient to help prevent microbial contamination, due to stagnant water within the dead leg. However, more recently, industrial experts are designing systems with <b>dead</b> <b>legs</b> limited to 3 D or less. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the effects of entry length, drop loop bends, dead-leg length and mainflow velocity on flow patterns within a branch of a 50 : 50 mm equal tee. A 2 D CFD analysis was carried out on a range of dead-leg configurations and the resulting data presented highlight the overall flow patterns with each branch. A rig was modified to carry out the dye injection tests, to verify CFD results. It was found that the entry length had a little effect on the flow velocity of the deadleg branch. However, when a bend was incorporated in the system, the entry length increase improved the flow patterns of all dead-leg branches. Different combinations of mainflow velocities, dead-leg lengths and length extensions were evaluated to investigate their effect on the flow pattern. It was observed that high mainflow velocities yielded better flow patterns in 2 DL and 4 DL when compared with 6 DL. High mainflow velocities resulted in good flow patterns at only 2 DL. At low mainflow velocities, 4 DL and 6 DL had better flow patterns compared with 2 DL. Increasing the length of the extension resulted in better flow patterns in 6 DL. At both, high and low mainflow velocities, 4 DL sowed a reasonable flow pattern in the branch. Flow visualization studies were performed as well as a CFD simulation. The results of both studies were in good agreement in the case of 4 DL branch length. However, for 2 DL, an accelerated dye dispersion was observed, suggesting a higher fluid exchange between the mainstream flow and the branch...|$|E
40|$|A {{dead leg}} is an {{inactive}} {{part of a}} process pipe, {{and it has been}} the cause of serious incidents due to liquid reaching its threshold value (TV) for freezing. The existing industrial approach for the design of <b>dead</b> <b>legs</b> is based on rules of thumb and reference standards. Accordingly, a detailed understanding of the temperature development is not available. An objective of this thesis is therefore to develop a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model in OpenFOAM that can analyse such cases in a more comprehensive matter. This study is based on investigations of the existing theory and industrial approach. This is further used to develop a realistic CFD simulation. The results are obtained from two dead leg geometries. One geometry presents the dead leg as a Fin, while the other geometry presents the dead leg connected to a main pipe, creating a T-junction. The dead leg dimensions are based on rules of thumb, namely a diameter of 2 " and a length of 0. 5 m. This gives a length to diameter ratio (L/D) of approximately 9. The results are obtained from three cases. Where the Fin geometry is related to Case 01 and the T-junction is related to Case 02 and Case 03. Case 01 and Case 03, are purely related to heat transfer, both steady-state and transient. The results of these two cases differs with approximately 10 %, indicating that the fin analysis may be sufficient when the ALARP principle is taken into account. In addition, an analysis is performed to investigate the effect of wind, which is observed to {{have a significant effect on}} the time for water to reach TV. Case 02 introduces a flow field and turbulence in the T-junction. It is observed that for a range of velocities, u= 1 - 2, 86 m/s, the circulation in the dead leg reach L/Di = 4 - 6 for the respective velocities. This results in a stagnant fluid in the end of the dead leg as the circulation cease to exist. This effect is reflected in the temperature development, the result implies almost no heat loss until L=Di = 4. 5 - 6. 8 where the temperature falls rapidly. Consequently, the effect of circulation implies that a design criterion may be established from further studies. Verification of the CFD-models has been performed by the use of grid independence test, existing theory and previous experimental results by Habib et al...|$|E
