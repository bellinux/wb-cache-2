With increase in hardness, there was a considerable increase disintegration time with all concentrations of superdisintegrants. Crospovidone and Methacrylic copolymer with <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> in combination showed a remarkable drop in disintegration time upto 0. 33 min. Stability Studies of the batch with lowest disintegration time was also carried out and suggests that there was no degradation with respect to time. The {{selection of}} a suitable superdisintegrant for a rapidly disintegrating dosage form is of the utmost importance, since disintegration time (DT) is a critical parameter. An experimental design was implemented, to find out the effects of superdisintegrants (sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, croscarmellose sodium and methacrylic copolymer with <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene),</b> at 2, 4, 6 % w/w, on tablet hardness, with respect to DT. Methacrylic copolymer with <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> (at 4 wt%) was selected as the best superdisintegrant, adequate for the formulation of dispersible Tramadol tablets. With increasing hardness, there was a considerable increase in DT at all concentrations of superdisintegrants. A combination of crospovidone and methacrylic copolymer with <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> showed a remarkable drop in DT to 0. 33 min.

Hyperbranched poly <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> (HB 2) with reactive (-vinyl; -CH=CH 2) and hydrogenated hyperbranched polyl <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> (H-HB 2) with non-reactive (ethyl; -CH 2 -CH 3) functional groups were {{used in this study}} as blend constituents with linear polystyrene (LP), since HB 2 materials were too brittle to produce films. HB 2 with reactive functional groups were crosslinked at high temperature which increased the glass transition temperature (Tg), thermal stability, viscosity and the tensile modulus (only after heat treatment at 200 C) of HB 2 blends (LP-HB 2) in comparison to LP.

40|$|This work {{details the}} {{synthesis}} of low density porous polymers, and characterisation {{with an emphasis on}} Time Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (TD-NMR). High energy laser physics utilises low density porous polymers to study astrophysical phenomena at high pressures and temperatures in the form of plasma. Low Z, low density Polymerised High Internal Phase Emulsions (PolyHIPE) and aerogels form a large part of these capabilities, however increasingly stringent laser target parameters are now required to develop new capabilities. For low density porous polymers, this demands greater control over properties such as pore size, density, composition (C[sub]nH[sub](>n)) and homogeneity through novel synthesis and characterisation. Microstructure inhomogeneity of styrene-co-divinyl benzene (S-co-DVB) polyHIPEs in conjunction with novel t-butyl styrene and para <b>divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> polyHIPEs were investigated using ¹H spin-lattice (T₁) and spin-lock (T[sub](1 ρ)) NMR relaxation experiments using TD-NMR. The strong relationship between ¹H spin-lattice relaxation times and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) data, and application of relaxation experiments at varied temperatures reveal that structural inhomogeneity is based on poor emulsion stability and clustering of DVB polymer affecting bulk molecular motion. <b>Divinyl</b> <b>benzene</b> (DVB) aerogels and a range of innovative C[sub]nH[sub](>n) aerogels such as poly- 5 -vinyl- 2 -norbornene were synthesised using free-radical, cationic or ring opening metathesis polymerisation techniques. A one-step synthesis of homogeneous density gradient DVB aerogels was developed for the first time, which is fundamental to be able to study plasma shock fronts. Characterisation using X-ray tomography revealed the homogeneous density gradient. Successful carbonisation of dichloroparaxylene (DCPX) aerogels has similar properties to resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogels, but is produced in significantly less time and shrinkage, presents as a candidate for future laser experiments. Correlation between NMR relaxation times to established techniques of DMA and mercury porosimetry was explored to determine the suitability of TD-NMR in characterisation of low density porous polymers...|$|E
