Until now, the water consumption readings of the population were taken one per month or one each two-months. In contrast, AMR systems provide hourly readings for households and more frequent readings for big consumers. On the one hand, this paper aims at predicting water demand and detect suspicious behaviors – e. g. a leak, a smart meter break down or even a fraud – by extracting water consumption patterns. On the other hand, the main contribution of this paper, a software framework, based on Big Data techniques, is presented to tackle the barriers of traditional data storage and data analysis since the volume of AMR data collected by Water Utilities is enormous and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>continuously</b> <b>growing</b> because this technology is expanding.

This paper proposes a framework that acts as a learning model to derive information by building relationships between different entities in online content by relying on few seeds being fed to the system at the start. Couple of extractors are used to derive facts based on their mutual correlations. Those facts have been occupied an ontology to generate new relationships and entities as candidates.

Because insular populations present unique ethnic, geographical, and environmental characteristics, we analyzed {{the evolution of}} prostate cancer age-adjusted world standardized incidence rates in Martinique in comparison with that of metropolitan France. We also compared prostate cancer incidence rates, and lifestyle-related and socioeconomic markers such as life expectancy, dietary energy, and fat supply and consumption, with those in other Caribbean islands, France, UK, Sweden, and USA. The incidence rate of prostate cancer in Martinique {{is one of the}} highest reported worldwide; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>continuously</b> <b>growing</b> since 1985 in an exponential mode, and despite a similar screening detection process and lifestyle-related behaviour, it is constantly at a higher level than in metropolitan France. However, Caribbean populations that are genetically close to that of Martinique have generally much lower incidence of prostate cancer. We found no correlation between prostate cancer incidence rates, life expectancy, and diet westernization. Since the Caribbean African descent-associated genetic susceptibility factor would have remained constant during the 1980 – 2005, we suggest that in Martinique some environmental change including the intensive use of carcinogenic organochlorine pesticides might have occurred as key determinant of the persisting highly growing incidence of prostate cancer...|$|E

In this work, optimal distillation process configuration was examined to recover valuable organic solvents and to cut down the production-related costs as well as to protect the environment against the industrial wastes. In this distillation process, some columns in a conventional sequence were optimized by using a box optimization algorithm to obtain minimum energy consumption without violence some constraints and then, main product columns were optimized in the economical point of view by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. To achieve further objective of energy improvement with high profit, thermally coupled distillation and heat pump assisted distillation were implemented as alternatives of conventional distillation column with low energy efficiency.

Higher education in China has witnessed the social political changes since the Japanese Invasion between 1938 and 1945. It also survived the Civil War between the Communists and Nationalists (1945 - 1949). It was influenced strongly by the Russians in the early 50 s, endured the Cultural Revolution between 1966 - 1976. After the death of Mao, Deng has adapted a more pragmatic outlook and Chinese universities opened its door once again to the public, not just the elite Communists cadres. Today, High Education in China is a major driving force for the economy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>continuously</b> <b>growing,</b> changing and developing and has played a significant part in economic growth, scientific progress and social development in the country. This study examined China’s historical education system which is based on legalist and Confucian ideals and the teaching of Confucius has shaped the overall Chinese mindset for the past 2500 years. It also highlights the new trends since the late 1980 s, China began to develop a Western oriented university model and tremendous economic development in China has stimulated reforms in higher education that has resulted in remarkable changes.

40|$|Modern <b>IT</b> systems <b>are</b> <b>continuously</b> <b>growing</b> both in {{size and}} complexity, thus making {{performance}} analysis and modelling an increasingly difficult task, if not intractable. As a result, {{in some cases the}} task has to be significantly simplified by focusing on selected system components or by reducing it to a smaller scale. One of the biggest challenges in system performance modelling is the accurate determination of service requirements. This thesis presents an investigation into novel statistical inference methods to effectively parameterise queueing models from system traces which exhibit diverse characteristics. I present two case studies, namely one of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application and one of a web server. Firstly, I propose a modelling methodology to address the limitations of service demand estimation based on CPU utilisation measurements by directly calibrating queueing models based on response time measurements. Secondly, with the aim of capturing more representative web workloads, I propose a methodology to parameterise queueing models for web server performance analysis that extracts hidden Markov models from real HTTP traffic via fitting. Experimental results indicate that all the methods developed as part of this thesis are highly competitive against state-of-the-art techniques.

The main challenge however seems to be the exchange between the rather segregated fields of geoinformation and the information infrastructure. Furthermore, the census 2011 is identified as a major challenge for the acquisition and management of geodata.
