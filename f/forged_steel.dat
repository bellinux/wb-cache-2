5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The <b>forged</b> <b>steel</b> globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Micro-alloyed cold <b>forging</b> <b>steel</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} to rule out heat treatment process before forging {{in order to save}} energy consumption. These non heat-treated cold <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> utilize the work hardening during cold working to ensure the mechanical properties. In other words, the required strength of forged part is achieved by work hardening with the accumulation of plastic strain during the cold working. Therefore, the plastic deformation characteristics should be carefully understood for successful process design. Evolution of both microstructure and plastic characteristics of micro-alloyed cold <b>forging</b> <b>steel</b> has been investigated in the present study. For the optimization of forging processes, finite element analysis and die life predictions were carried out...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the effects of}} {{tungsten}} (W) addition and heat treatment conditions on the microstructure, impact toughness and tensile properties of microalloyed <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> were studied. Four kinds of microalloyed <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> were produced by varying W additions (0, 0. 5, 1 and 2 wt%). Heat treatment was carried out at temperatures ranging from 840 to 950 °C followed by air and furnace cooling. Mechanical tests were {{used to evaluate the}} room temperature Charpy impact and tensile properties. The resulting microstructures were analysed via optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that the microstructure and mechanical properties of the microalloyed <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> are closely related to the W content. Correct selection of heat treatment temperature and cooling method is very important to enhance the mechanical properties. The optimum heat treatment temperatures obtained in this study are 920, 900, 880 and 860 °C for the steels with 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % W, respectively. Both the impact toughness and tensile properties of the microalloyed <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> have been significantly enhanced after heat treatment at the optimum temperatures followed by air cooling...|$|R

Similar contracts gave the company, renamed the Bethlehem Steel Company, a consistent source of income, and Wharton made slow but steady profits. In 1901 he sold the company but continued to be the largest producer of pig iron in the country because of his extensive iron and coal mines and refining works.|$|E

40|$|Light-weight {{design is}} one of the main drivers for {{material}} development in the automotive industry. For optimum weight reduction new materials and their fatigue behavior under real cyclic service loads have to be taken into account (Gassner test). Currently the casted components made from Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) show better service fatigue life for variable load cases than some traditional <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> because of it’s inherent retained austenite. The traditional <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> are the precipitation hardening ferritic-pearlitic steels (PHFP steel) and the martensitic quenched and tempered (Q&T) steels. The next <b>steel</b> generation for <b>forged</b> components in the drive train might be bainitic steels with an optimized microstructure with respect to cyclic behavior. Depending on the chemical composition and the heat treatment it includes a ferritic primary phase and a secondary phase, which consists of either carbides, martensite, retained austenite or M/A constituents. By alloying of more than 1 % Si the formation of cementite will be suppressed and a carbide free bainite (CFB) will be formed. The secondary phase of this CFB contains retained austenite, which has the possibility to close crack tips by local compression stresses due to the transformation to martensite. As a result of this CFB exhibits better cyclic properties than the commonly used <b>forging</b> <b>steels.</b> The materials and process design as well as results of the fatigue behavior will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Lightweight {{design in}} the {{automotive}} industry is not always combined with the usage of alternative materials like composites. Even high strength steels have high potential for reducing the weight for lightweight design. For the forging industry a new steel is developed, which enables the TRIP-effect (Transformation Induced Plasticity) for forging parts. This material effect is already well known and used for steel sheet structures. The TRIP-effect {{is based on the}} structure of the TRIP-material containing retained austenite, which has the possibility to form residual stresses due to the austenite-martensite transformation under cyclic loading. Beside static properties, the dynamic and cyclic material behaviour has a high importance for parts in the automotive industry. So, for lightweight design, a focus has to be on fatigue behaviour under service loads including overloads for an optimal weight reduction. The traditional <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> are the precipitation hardening fe rritic-pearlitic steels (PHFP steel) and the martensitic quenched and tempered (Q&T) steels. In comparison to these steels, the new generation of TRIP <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> has an improved cyclic material behaviour. To utilize this potential, attention has to be paid to the sequence of cooling down the material from the forging temperature because the properties of the material depend on the cooling rate between 500 °C and 200 °C. In this paper, the high potential of this new generation of <b>forging</b> <b>steels</b> is shown.
