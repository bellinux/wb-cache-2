25|$|A {{number of}} factors {{determine}} whether or not a depleted gas field will make an economically viable storage facility. Geographically, depleted reservoirs should be relatively close to <b>gas</b> <b>markets</b> and to transportation infrastructure (pipelines and distribution systems) which will connect them to that market. Since the fields were at one time productive and connected to infrastructure, distance from market is the dominant geographical factor. Geologically, it is preferred that depleted reservoir formations have high porosity and permeability. The porosity of the formation is one of the factors that determines the amount of natural gas the reservoir is able to hold. Permeability {{is a measure of the}} rate at which natural gas flows through the formation and ultimately determines the rate of injection and withdrawal of gas from storage.|$|E

Both these contingencies contributed to the growing importance of hedging against weather risk. Weather is unambiguously the primary determinant of demand in the natural <b>gas</b> <b>market.</b> For that reason, we build a model predicting consumption in the Czech natural <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> with respect to its temperature sensitivity. Such an analysis frequently serves as the first indicator of the need for weather risk hedging, which is since the 90 's commonly done with weather derivatives. Therefore we go through so called burn analysis that determines the fair price of an option with regard to past temperature measurements...|$|R

The Mediterranean Sea Research Centre of Israel was established in 2012 with an initial budget of NIS 70 million; new study programmes have since been launched at the centre to train engineers and other professionals for the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the Office of the Chief Scientist, among others, plans to use Israel’s fledgling natural gas industry as a stepping stone to building capacity in advanced technology and opening up opportunities for Israeli innovation targeting the global oil and <b>gas</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{regulatory}} delays, the decision resulted in lower {{natural gas prices}} for consumers particularly during the times of rapid oil price increases during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. [...] However, with interstate gas prices kept low under FPC regulation, an alternative network of intrastate pipelines developed in gas producing states offering higher gas prices. Producers sought to sell gas into the intrastate markets whenever possible, resulting in natural gas shortages in the interstate market. Finally, Congress in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 established a substitute set of wellhead prices set by statute and merged the interstate and intrastate <b>gas</b> <b>markets.</b> [...] Ultimately, Congress deregulated all wellhead natural gas prices effective January 1, 1993, with the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (NGWDA) of 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its low density, it is {{not easy}} to store natural gas or to {{transport}} it by vehicle. Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in America are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural <b>gas</b> <b>markets</b> are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. [...] In Western Europe, the gas pipeline network is already dense. New pipelines are planned or under construction in Eastern Europe and between gas fields in Russia, Near East and Northern Africa and Western Europe. See also List of natural gas pipelines.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{world oil}} and <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> has {{entered a new}} period of low oil prices, which has inevitably {{affected}} the natural <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> in China. So, it is urgent to timely study the market trends and to actively seek for appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, the development trends of China's <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> under the situations of New Normal and low oil prices were analyzed {{from the perspective of}} sustainable development of the natural gas industrial chain and market, by taking the Sichuan and Chongqing gas provinces as an example, which are of representative and of great significance to China in its natural <b>gas</b> <b>market.</b> The following trends were identified. First, the <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> reform will be deepened. Second, the competition among major market players will be intensified. Third, supply will exceed demand. Fourth, export tasks will be difficult. Fifth, higher demand of “guarantees of the minimum GDP, tax and profit” will be raised for local government. And sixth, low-cost strategy will be indispensable to oil and gas enterprises. In order to cater to these trends, some countermeasures were presented during the 13 th Five-Year Plan. First, to improve the natural <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> system, to strengthen the supply-side reform, to complete market development modes, and to promote the introduction of governmental policies for relevant industries. Second, to develop the efficient gas-consuming clusters such as industrial parks, LNG-fueled vehicles and vessels, and distributed energy sources system, to establish innovative marketing strategy systems, and to boost the localization of resource consumption, through the establishment of strategic alliances for natural <b>gas</b> terminal <b>markets</b> in partnership with local governments and competitive enterprises, while the Chinese government is intensifying efforts in promoting energy conservation and pollution reduction and haze control. Third, to improve the cobweb pipeline network system, and to establish the strategic reserve system. And fourth, to make greater efforts to deepen internal reforms, to cut costs in a sustainable way through technological and managerial innovation, so as to respond to any changes in the natural <b>gas</b> <b>market</b> as a result of low oil prices...|$|R
