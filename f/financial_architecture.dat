5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international <b>financial</b> <b>architecture.</b> Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international <b>financial</b> <b>architecture,</b> and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

After outlining the features of <b>financial</b> <b>architectures</b> that are most probably responsible for the distinction, I evaluate transition economies, by judging their vulnerability from this perspective, and by offering future policies suggestions for acquiring a financial structure of the second type.

Our investigation highlights: (i) the occurrence of absolute and conditional convergence; (ii) the existence of appreciable intra - distribution dynamics in the convergence process; and that, when conditioning for cross - country measures of the legal protection of creditors’ rights, (iii) the bankruptcy laws and their enforcement strongly boost credit markets’ average period growth rates. convergence, financial market development, investor protection, rule of law. ...|$|R

[...] Kenneth Davidson, a columnist for The Age and outspoken critic of the project, claimed the government's business case did not justify the road and that [...] "the financial burden on the Victorian taxpayer will be so big that it will 'crowd out' the state's core responsibilities for funding schools, hospitals, rail transport and even other roads for at least a generation." ...|$|E

40|$|Every {{financial}} crisis leaves behind important lessons, while exposing {{the limitations of}} the policy framework for preventing a systemic crisis. The sub-prime crisis has seriously dented the credibility of every institution vested with the responsibility for promoting financial stability. Besides the immediate global policy accent on crisis management in the form of unprecedented bailouts and massive liquidity injections, considerable analysis and policy emphasis has been directed at understanding the crisis in order to identify why and where the international <b>financial</b> stability <b>architecture</b> failed, and how it could be restructured to make it more effective in preventing another major {{financial crisis}} in future. The paper outlines the causes of the crisis, highlights the important policy issues that the global policy making community has to address, and discusses several suggestions for improving the global <b>financial</b> stability <b>architecture.</b> Copyright © 2009 The Author.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the <b>financial</b> stability <b>architecture</b> in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability. In this context, the financial crisis {{has proved to be a}} major challenge to the ongoing process of European financial integration. In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting cross-border financial groups, questioned the ability of the EU <b>financial</b> stability <b>architecture</b> to contain threats to the integrated single financial market. In particular, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of coupling to micro-prudential supervision a macro dimension aimed at a broad and effective monitoring and assessment of the potential risks covering all components of the financial system. In Europe, following the de Larosière Report, the European Commission has put forward proposals for establishing a European System of Financial Supervision and a European Systemic Risk Board, the latter body to be set up under the auspices of the ECB.

40|$|An {{evolutionary}} theory of {{international financial institutions}} is developed and two broad types of possible (evolutionary) equilibrium Global Financial Architectures(GFAs) are identified. The first is called an overarching type, exemplified by the classical gold standard and the defunct Bretton Woods system. The second is called a hybrid form that allows for the existence and coevolution of some Regional Financial Architectures(RFAs) as well. The changing roles of the IMF and national economic policies are examined within these two possible <b>financial</b> <b>architectures</b> under globalization It is found that from an evolutionary perspective, a hybrid form with a reformed IMF and regional cooperation through appropriately designed RFAs can create the best possible institutional and policy environment for financial stability and sustained growth. An evolutionary argument, called "the extended panda's thumb", is advanced to establish the possibility of adapting many existing institutions including the IMF, for creating a hybrid GFA. The tentative steps taken towards regional cooperation in Asia after the financial crisis are discussed to illustrate the opportunities and challenges posed {{by the need to}} evolve towards a hybrid GFA. ...|$|R
