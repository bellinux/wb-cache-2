He {{said she had to}} be careful not to get scratched by the cat, and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene, the rats remained hidden in a corner and the birds did not fly much. Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person, the video is unrelated to the lyrics, as noted by author Alice Novak. In reviews, Yahoo! Music said that, through the video, [...] " [...] <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> into her dark and magical universe", and Premiere deemed it [...] "mysterious, provocative". Considering it a short film, Cachin praised the music video as being [...] "perfectly done".|$|E
500|$|Nobody, {{according}} to Hazlitt (voicing his disagreement with Dr. Johnson), excelled Shakespeare in tragedy; although his comedies could be first rate, other writers, such as Molière, Cervantes, and Rabelais, excelled {{him in some}} types of comedy. It was in the comedy of [...] "Nature" [...] that Shakespeare was supreme. This is not comedy that satirises the [...] "ridiculous" [...] but is rather the comedy of [...] "convivial laughter", which gently mocks human foibles and <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> to share in innocent pleasures. [...] Of this kind of comedy, Twelfth Night is [...] "one of the most delightful". Unlike the [...] "comedy of artificial life, of wit, of satire," [...] Shakespeare's more gentle comedy [...] "makes us laugh at the follies of mankind, not despise them [...] Shakespear's comic genius resembles the bee rather in its power of extracting sweets from weeds or poisons, than in leaving a sting behind it." ...|$|E

[...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "Pearl Jam uses its new album... to broaden its music," [...] and added that [...] "most of the album... projects individual misery as public catharsis." [...] AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Vs. may not reach the majestic heights of Ten, but at least half the record stands with Pearl Jam's best work." ...|$|E

500|$|Sasha Geffen from MTV News noted Gaga's eyes {{rolling back}} in {{her head as she}} moshes with the crowd in the clip and [...] "at one point she almost rips the head off of [...] ". Similar {{thoughts}} were echoed in Lara Walsh's review of the clip for InStyle, where she fawned about being a [...] "big fan" [...] of Gaga's [...] "raw appearance" [...] in the video. Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it". Callegari complimented the visuals for bringing out Gaga as both a performer and singer, [...] "and this video <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> to enjoy her in her purest form".|$|E
500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{headed into}} the studio in early 1993 facing the {{challenge}} of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy." [...] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles [...] "Go", [...] "Daughter", [...] "Animal", and [...] "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." [...] He added, [...] "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> into a drama of experiment and strife." [...] The band decided, beginning {{with the release of}} Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of [...] "Jeremy" [...] and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band [...] "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans." [...] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.|$|E

2500|$|... a {{prolonged}} reflection on Mary’s {{role in the}} events of the crucifixion that relates her boundless grief and envisions her participation in the suffering of her son. Accordingly this text raises significant questions about the development of ‘affective’ modes of piety and the concept of Marian compassion, both of which are closely linked with meditations on Mary’s presence at the cross in the later Christian tradition. In particular, this new evidence <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> to rethink certain explanations of these phenomena that would link their genesis to the end of iconoclasm in the East (the ninth century) and the beginnings of the High Middle Ages in the West (the eleventh century). In the case of the Christian East, the importance of this early Life of the Virgin for understanding the emergence of new styles of Marian devotion is unmistakably clear. Yet its potential influence on similar developments in the Christian West is somewhat less certain and difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, even if it may ultimately prove impossible to connect all of the dots between this late ancient text and the piety of the Western High Middle Ages, it seems increasingly clear that we have to reckon with the initial emergence of Marian lament and compassion and affective devotion in rather different historical circumstances than have traditionally been envisaged.|$|E
