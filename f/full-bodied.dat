5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and <b>full-bodied</b> vocal {{performance}} to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, <b>full-bodied</b> wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E
5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, <b>full-bodied</b> creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with {{relatively}} moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee {{is the best in}} terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or Musang King.|$|E
25|$|Previous Autumn {{seasonal}} Tumbler Brown Ale {{has been}} described as a <b>full-bodied,</b> malt-heavy brown ale and is sold for the autumn months.|$|E
25|$|Soil types include sandstone, shale, {{clay and}} shelly limestone. The {{combination}} of warm days and cool nights gives a long growing season, resulting in crisp, aromatic and <b>full-bodied</b> wines.|$|E
25|$|Master of Wine Jancis Robinson {{notes that}} Grüner Veltliner is usually {{produced}} dry with spicy, peppery notes. It is often <b>full-bodied</b> and with age {{can take on}} aromas and flavors similar to white Burgundies.|$|E
25|$|Grenache blanc B: this is {{the white}} form of Grenache black N. A variety of quality, it {{produces}} fine <b>full-bodied</b> dry wines, albeit with sometimes deficient acidity. It also provides natural sweet wines of high quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{style and}} flavor profile of wines made from Syrah is {{influenced}} by the climate where the grapes are grown with moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State) tending to produce medium to <b>full-bodied</b> wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint and black pepper. In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently <b>full-bodied</b> with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Gevrey-Chambertin (jehv ray sham ber tan) is {{noted for its}} <b>full-bodied</b> red wines, {{particularly}} those from one of its nine grand cru vineyards-Le Chambertin, Chambertin-Clos de Beze, Mazis-Chambertin, Chapelle-Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, Mazoyeres-Chambertin, Griotte-Chambertin, Latricieres-Chambertin and Ruchottes-Chambertin. The village of Morey-St-Denis (maw ree san d'nee) is noted for it <b>full-bodied</b> red wines, particularly those from one of it five grand cru vineyards-Clos de la Roche, Clos St. Denis, Clos des Lambrays, Clos de Tart and Bonnes Mares which it shares with the village of Chambolle-Musigny. Chambolle-Musigny (shom bowl moo sih nyee) is noted for the more elegant style of wines comes from its grand cru vineyards of Bonnes Mares and Musigny {{as well as its}} several high quality premier crus.|$|E

25|$|Both Artemis statues {{are thought}} to be Hellenistic due to the hairstyle and stance, and both show a <b>full-bodied</b> Artemis with a long skirt that {{covering}} her legs. While the Artemis A figure is similar to the others in the collection and larger than life, the Artemis B statue is somewhat smaller than life-size.|$|E
25|$|Colchagua Valley {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} wine regions of Chile. It {{occupies}} the southern part of Rapel Valley, running from the Andes in the east to the Coastal Range in the west. Most of the important Colchagua vineyards lie {{in the foothills of the}} Coastal Range. The area is best known for its <b>full-bodied</b> Malbecs, Cabernet Sauvignons, Carmeneres and Syrahs.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wines}} {{produced}} under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable {{amount of the}} area's most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used {{in the production of}} Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers are experimenting with reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from basic nouveau table wines, <b>full-bodied</b> red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling spumante. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. They have many characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their sour cherry flavor. While <b>full-bodied</b> recioto and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15–16%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11%. For wines labeled Valpolicella Superiore the wines must be aged a minimum of one year in wood and reach a minimum alcohol level of 12%.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} Syrah {{are also used}} in the {{production}} of other wine styles, such as rosé wine, fortified wine in Port wine style, and sparkling red wine. While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a <b>full-bodied</b> sparkling dry Shiraz, that contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in still wine.|$|E
25|$|Tom Chaplin's vocal {{style is}} {{measured}} and elegantly delivered; he uses no grit and doesn't drive his voice {{when the music}} ramps up, stepping up in volume rather than aggression as most other rock singers are prone to do. Therefore, Keane's signature sound is a gentle, refined but <b>full-bodied</b> brand of romantic pop-rock which does not crunch or overdrive itself, but manages to soar using orchestration and other arrangement means.|$|E
25|$|Master of Wine Clive Coates {{describes}} the Chardonnay of Corton-Charlemagne as being slower to mature than Montrachet with well-made examples from favorable vintages needing at least 10 years of aging {{before they are}} drinking at their peak. Coates note that the wines from the Pernand-Vergelesses side {{tend to have a}} flinty note and be characterized by more austerity than those from the Aloxe-Corton side that can be slightly more firm and <b>full-bodied.</b>|$|E
25|$|Called Auxerrois or Côt Noir in Cahors, called Malbec in Bordeaux, and Pressac {{in other}} places, the grape became less popular in Bordeaux after 1956 when frost killed off 75% of the crop. Despite Cahors {{being hit by}} the same frost, which devastated the vineyards, Malbec was replanted and {{continued}} to be popular in that area where it was mixed with Merlot and Tannat to make dark, <b>full-bodied</b> wines, and more recently has been made into 100% Malbec varietal wines.|$|E
25|$|In the New World Blaufränkisch {{is found}} in the Australian wine region of the Adelaide Hills, where a single grower, Hahndorf Hill, has been growing this variety for the past 20 years to make a <b>full-bodied</b> version of this wine. Other {{producers}} in Australia have recently planted Blaufränkisch and will soon be presenting their own versions. In Canada, there are some plantings of the variety in Ontario in the Niagara region, British Columbia wine regions of Vancouver Island and the Okanagan Valley.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{sparkling}} wine production {{has come a}} long time according to Wine Australia 2014-2015 annual report in {{a very short period of}} time with several notable French Champagne houses investing in production. Tasmania is the current hot bed of Australian Sparkling wine with both the traditional grape varieties and method of secondary fermentation being employed. Whilst most {{sparkling wine}} is produced from Chardonnay, Pinot noir and possibly Pinot Meuniere, an Australian speciality is sparkling Shiraz, a red sparkling wine produced from Shiraz grapes. Most sparkling Shiraz is traditionally somewhat sweet, but some producers make it dry, <b>full-bodied</b> and tannic.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{two main}} species grown, arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is {{generally}} more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from C. canephora); robusta tends to be bitter and have less flavor but better body than arabica. For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica. Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than arabica. Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a <b>full-bodied</b> taste and a better foam head (known as crema).|$|E
25|$|Vernaccia di San Gimignano is a {{white wine}} made from the Vernaccia grape in the areas around San Gimignano. In 1966, {{it was the first}} wine to receive a DOC designation. This wine style has been made in the area for over seven centuries and is {{considered}} Tuscany's best and most characterful white wine. The wine is dry and <b>full-bodied</b> with earthy notes of honey and minerals. In some styles it can be made to emphasize the fruit more and some producers have experimented with aging or fermenting the wine in oak barrels in order to give the wine a sense of creaminess or toastiness.|$|E
25|$|The Weinviertel {{region in}} the northeast, {{along the border with}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia, is home to {{more than half of all}} Austrian Grüner Veltliner with 8,529 {{hectares}} (21,076 acres) reported in 2012. Here the grape can achieve very high yields (up to 100 hectoliters/hectare or 5.7 tonnes/acre) and can produce simple, quaffing wines with fresh acidity and crisp fruit as well as base wine for sparkling sekt. But in vineyards on favorable locations where the yields are restricted, wine producers can make examples of <b>full-bodied,</b> dry Grüner Veltliner that has pepper, mineral and citrus notes that can develop Burgundian wine traits as they age.|$|E
25|$|Amarones are rich, <b>full-bodied</b> wines with {{flavor and}} aroma notes {{that are often}} {{compared}} to the flavors of Port wine. The wines often have notes of mocha, bitter-sweet dark chocolate, raisin, dried fig and earthy flavors. At restaurants sommeliers will often recommend food and wine pairings for Amarone with hearty, heavy dishes such as meat roasts. A classic after-dinner assortment is Amarone paired with walnuts and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Master of wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that well-made examples of Amarone from favorable vintages usually need about ten years of bottle aging for the flavors to mature, and {{have the potential to}} continue developing for twenty years or more.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch {{or the end of}} the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more <b>full-bodied</b> than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E
25|$|Bonnezeaux AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC {{comprises}} three southwest facing slopes {{within the}} village of Thouarcé that produce sweet, often botrytized, wines made entirely from Chenin blanc. Harvest in Bonnezeaux is very labor-intensive requiring harvested {{to go through the}} vineyards in multiple passes or tries selecting only the ripest individual grapes. In 2003 the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) increased the harvest sugar levels from 204grams per liter to 238 and the minimum residual sugar levels of the finished wine from 17grams per liter to 34. Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of Bonnezeaux as being more <b>full-bodied</b> and richer than those of Quarts-de-Chaume with an aging potential of up to 20 years or more.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, <b>full-bodied</b> Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed bean soup.|$|E
25|$|Some records {{estimate}} that over 600 grape varieties are planted throughout Spain but 80% of the country's wine production {{is focused on}} only 20 grape varieties. The most widely planted grape is the white wine grape Airén, prized for its hardiness and resistance to drop. It is found throughout central Spain and for many years served as the base for Spanish brandy. Wines made from this grape can be very alcoholic and prone to oxidation. The red wine grape Tempranillo {{is the second most}} widely planted grape variety, recently eclipsing Garnacha in plantings in 2004. It is known throughout Spain under a variety of synonyms that may appear on Spanish wine labels-including Cencibel, Tinto Fino and Ull de Llebre. Both Tempranillo and Garnacha are used to make the <b>full-bodied</b> red wines associated with the Rioja, Ribera del Duero and Penedès with Garnacha being the main grape of the Priorat region. In the Levante region, Monastrell and Bobal have significant plantings, being used for both dark red wines and dry rosé.|$|E
25|$|The bird most {{frequently}} found in armory is, by far, the eagle. Eagles in heraldry are predominantly presented {{with one or}} two heads, though triple-headed eagles are not unknown, and one eagle appearing in the Codex Manesse curiously has its wing bones fashioned into additional heads. Eagles and their wings also feature prominently as crests. Eagles {{most frequently}} appear <b>full-bodied,</b> with one head, in numerous positions including displayed, statant, passant and rising. The demi-eagle, which is shown only from the waist up, occurs less frequently. Double-headed eagles almost always appear displayed. As a result of being the dominant charge on the imperial Byzantine, Holy Roman, Austrian and Russian coats of arms, the double eagle gained enduring notoriety throughout the Western world. Among the present day nations with an eagle charge on their coat of arms are: Albania, Austria, Germany, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia. Additionally, the Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash is used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. There are many meanings attached to this symbol, and it was introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the Knight Kadosh degree.|$|E
25|$|In Christian art, {{the hand}} of God has {{traditionally}} been understood as an artistic metaphor that {{is not intended to}} indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the <b>full-bodied</b> figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment. According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of {{the hand of}} God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible. In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice. In later Christian works it tends {{to be replaced by a}} fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more <b>full-bodied</b> style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E
