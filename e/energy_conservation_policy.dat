40|$|A {{number of}} industrialized and {{developing}} countries agreed {{to the terms of}} the Kyoto protocol to conserve energy and reduce emissions. The close relationship between energy consumption and real GDP growth suggests that <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> are likely to affect real GDP growth. In this paper, the possible impact of <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> on the New Zealand economy is examined and compared with Australia and several Asian economies. Causality between energy consumption and GDP in New Zealand is investigated as is the causal relationship between GDP and various disaggregate energy data (coal, natural gas, electricity and oil). Based on the energy data used, it appears that <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> may not have significant impacts on real GDP growth in industrialized countries such as New Zealand and Australia compared to some Asian economies. © 2003 IMACS.

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with the global warming issue, most of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies have made <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policy</b> a top {{priority}} in terms of their energy policies. The energy efficiency indicators included in the present paper focus on the micro-foundation aspects. There are basically two types of energy efficiency indicators, namely, the economic-thermodynamic energy efficiency indicators (that use real GDP as the denominator), and the physical-thermodynamic energy efficiency indicators (that are based on the output volume index). While the common definitions and consistent methodology used in the present paper fulfill the IEA pyramid EEI concept, the new methodology in this paper compares the decomposition effects between upstream and downstream industries when aggregating efficiency changes. These decomposition effects can thereby provide valuable explanations for the <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policy</b> needed by energy policy and government administrators. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} long-run {{relationship}} between energy consumption and real {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) in Turkey {{taking into account the}} size of unrecorded economy. Since in developing countries, mainly due to the unrecorded economic activities, the official GDP is not measured correctly, the investigation of the linkage between energy consumption and official GDP may not give reliable results. In this study, empirical results for the case of Turkey over the period 1970 - 2005 suggest that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the officially calculated GDP and energy consumption. Besides, using the error-correction modeling technique, we find out that unidirectional causality runs from official GDP to energy in both short and long runs. However, when we take into account unrecorded economy, we detect neither cointegration nor causality between energy consumption and true GDP. These empirical findings imply that: first, <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> can be implemented in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without any adverse effect on the recorded economic activities; second the production function in the unrecorded economy is not stable. Furthermore, economic policies to combat unrecorded economy may not serve as a complement to <b>energy</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R
