40|$|Credit {{extensions}} {{to banks}} using the Fedwire Funds Service-the Federal Reserve's real-time gross settlement (RTGS) payments system-can reach intraday peaks {{as high as}} $ 86 billion. This article evaluates the effectiveness of alternative methods of settling Fedwire payments in reducing intraday credit extensions. The authors simulate three <b>deferred</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms that complement RTGS systems: one-hour netting, six-hour netting, and a mechanism called a receipt-reactive gross settlement (RRGS) system. Their results suggest that in conjunction with RTGS systems, the RRGS mechanism could significantly reduce daylight credit extensions while modestly delaying the average time of payment settlement. Moreover, certain features of RRGS systems may encourage banks to submit payments earlier in the day. Further research on RRGS systems may shed light on whether they {{could prove to be}} a true liquidity-saving complement to real-time gross settlement systems.

System-specific ratios are first developed to extract bilateral payment obligations from aggregate payments data in the Australian RTGS system. This synthetic data is then used to generate a <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement</b> (DNS) system of similar dimensions to those the Australian system would have had, had RTGS not been introduced. Standard default simulation methodology is then applied to test the levels of systemic risk in both this system and the corresponding RTGS system to ascertain {{the degree to which the}} introduction of RTGS is likely to have reduced the level of risk. We find that while the level of systemic risk is likely to have been reduced in the Australian case, the size of the effect is small, a finding consistent with the results of payments system studies in other countries.

40|$|This {{paper will}} provide an {{overview}} of various electronic payment systems: interbank clearing systems, electronic funds transfers, financial EDI, retail payments (ATMs, EFTPoS, card payments, smart cards), home banking and Internet payment systems. Interbank clearing systems The global nature of eCommerce necessitates mechanisms by which payments can be made between organisations and individuals across (as well as within) national boundaries. For this reason, interbank transfers of funds and other transactions need to be facilitated, both within and between countries. Interbank clearing systems enable this transfer, clearing and settlement of funds between banks. Clearing is an accounting process by which banks determine the total amount of funds which they owe other banks or which other banks owe them (based on interbank payments) and then pay each other the difference to `balance the books' (Tyree 1998). Settlement, by contrast, refers to the actual payment of the difference and/or the one of two ways in which the payment is done (General Government Division 1997; Tyree 1998) :. <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement,</b> where settlement (or payment) occurs between the banks once a day (see Figure 1); or. real time gross settlement, where settlement occurs immediately when the payment is made between the customers of the two banks concerned (see Figure 2).

40|$|Under a {{real-time}} {{gross settlement}} (RTGS) system, {{there is an}} incentive for system participants to delay making their outgoing payments to facili-tate their funding, and this creates the risk of settlement delays spreading throughout the entire system. Intraday credit facility and market practices have been established to avoid the risk and led to settlement concen-tration in the morning, as well as concentrations at the specific times due to other <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement</b> (DNS) systems. The heterogeneity of intraday progress of settlements causes intraday fluctuation in interest rates. In this paper, we analyze and run simulations on the payment net-work to understand the intraday flow of funds within Japan’s interbank money market, especially recycling of the “receipt-driven payments. ” We find that (1) {{the shape of the}} payment network changes with the time of day, and payment recycling becomes more likely when the density of the network is high; (2) patterns of intraday payment flow differ across the three RTGS systems of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, reflecting differences in each country’s system for, and underlying approach to, settlement and funding; and (3) participants comprising the hub of the payment network function as absorbers of contagion under a condition sufficiently stressful to cause a cascade of settlement delays...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{economists and}} central bankers have been {{concerned}} for some time {{about the possibility of}} financial contagion spreading from bank to bank via interbank exposures within the payments system. The initial study of payments system risk was undertaken by Humphrey (1986) who found significant risk in the U. S. Fedwire system in the mid 1980 s. Subsequent studies by Angelini, Maresca & Russo (1996), Kuussaari (1996), Northcott (2002), Furfine (2003) and Wang & Docherty (2006) have found, however, little evidence of systemic risk in the payments systems of Italy, Finland, Canada, Australia and in the U. S. inter-bank market. All of these studies employ a methodology in which the effects of a simulated failure at one institution on other institutions are examined and quantified but no formal statement of the simulation process is usually provided. One exception to this is the study by Wang & Docherty (2006) but it is possible to further refine and sharpen the exposition offered in that study.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the possibility that}} financial contagion may be spread from one bank to another via the Australian payments system. The initial study of payments system risk was undertaken by Humphrey (1986) who found significant risk in the U. S. Fedwire system in the mid 1980 s.

S. inter-bank market. Given that the implementation of real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems in many countries, including Australia, at significant cost, {{has been designed to}} reduce payments system risk, the finding that this risk is small is significant. While detailed payments system data for Australia is not available to researchers outside the Reserve Bank, this study constructs a synthetic data set based on available information and uses this data to simulate the failure of each financial institution operating in the Australian payments system. We find little evidence of systemic risk in the Australian payments system using this approach and conclude that the introduction of RTGS in the Australian system in 1996 had only a marginal effect on risk. payments system; real time gross <b>settlement</b> (RTGS); <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement</b> (DNS); systemic risk; contagion...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of e-commerce, along with rising domestic and cross-border payments, has fueled the demand among financial institutions for a cost-effective means to expedite {{clearing and settlement}} of low-value retail payments. These are called faster payments settlement systems. Traditionally, retail payments have made extensive use of interbank netting systems, in which payments are accumulated for end-of-day settlement. This approach, known as <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement</b> (DNS), reduces the liquidity needs of the payment system, but bears inherent operational and financial risks for unsettled intraday payments. As large dollar volumes of retail payments accumulate, real-time gross settlement (RTGS) has been recognized as an attractive option, especially for high-value payments. It permits immediate settlement of transactions during the day, but it brings up other risks and incentives issues that require consideration. This research proposes a hybrid faster payments settlement system involving elements of both DNS and RTGS. We explore a mechanism that supports centralized queuing, permits payment prioritization, reduces payment delays, enhances liquidity, and optimizes the settlement process. We offer a modeling framework and experimental simulations to evaluate the proposed approach. Our evaluation {{is based on a}} set of system performance conjectures that support operational performance evaluation and mechanism design-related policy insights.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the main {{building}} blocks of an ongoing project to develop a computational agent-based simulator for a generic real-time large-value interbank payment system with a central processor that can implement different rules for payment settlement. The main types of payment system in their polar forms are Real Time Gross <b>Settlement</b> (RTGS) and <b>Deferred</b> Net <b>Settlement</b> (DNS). DNS generates large quantities of settlement risk; in contrast, the elimination of settlement risk in RTGS comes with excessive demands for liquidity on banks. This could lead them to adopt various delaying tactics to minimise liquidity needs with free-riding and other ‘bad’ equilibria as potential outcomes. The introduction of hybrid systems with real-time netting is viewed as a means by which liquidity costs can be reduced while settlement risk is unchanged. Proposed reforms for settlement rules make it imperative to have a methodology to assess the efficiency of the different variants along three dimensions: the cost of liquidity to the individual banks and the system as a whole, settlement risk at both bank and system levels, and how early in the day payments are processed, since this proxies the impact of an operational incident. In this paper, we build a simulator for interbank payments capable of handling real time payment records along with autonomous bank behaviour and show that {{it can be used to}} evaluate different payment system designs against these three criteri...|$|R
40|$|As {{the last}} {{stage in the}} risk-prevention {{programme}} for the Paris financial centre, the securing of <b>deferred</b> net <b>settlement</b> systems concerns the SIT interbank clearing system, the retail payment system for customer transactions, and Relit, the securities delivery-versus-payment system, which in particular processes transactions effected on the regulated market Euronext Paris. The Banque de France, which {{is in charge of}} overseeing the smooth functioning of payment and securities settlement systems has taken the step of asking the French banking community to strengthen the security of the SIT and Relit systems. The aim of this initiative to enhance security (or built-in protection) is to protect these systems, in compliance with the applicable international standards, from settlement risk. The risks borne by the participants in SIT and Relit are systemic in character and this has been accentuated by the recent developments in the European environment in which these systems operate. The protection mechanisms defined for these two systems display similar features: protection against the failure of the participant with the largest settlement obligation, establishment of a permanent common mutual fund for each of the two systems, supplemented where necessary by individual collateral, setting of ceilings for transactions exchanged, and use of central bank money holdings as collateral. The implementation of these safety mechanisms for SIT and Relit will involve various players, who will accordingly take on new responsibilities: participants in the two systems, the administrator of the guarantee fund (a role which will fall to the operator of each of the two systems: GSIT for SIT and Euroclear France for Relit), as well the depository for collateral, which will be the Banque de France. ...|$|R

6000|$|This {{leads us}} to mention another {{conspicuous}} characteristic of Dr. Cumming’s teaching—the absence of genuine charity. It is true that he makes large profession of tolerance and liberality within a certain circle; he exhorts Christians to unity; he would have Churchmen fraternize with Dissenters, and exhorts these two branches of God’s family to <b>defer</b> the <b>settlement</b> of their differences till the millennium. But the love thus taught is {{the love of the}} clan, which is the correlative of antagonism to the rest of mankind. It is not sympathy and helpfulness toward men as men, but toward men as Christians, and as Christians {{in the sense of a}} small minority. Dr. Cumming’s religion may demand a tribute of love, but it gives a charter to hatred; it may enjoin charity, but it fosters all uncharitableness. If I believe that God tells me to love my enemies, but at the same time hates His own enemies and requires me to have one will with Him, which has the larger scope, love or hatred? And we refer to those pages of Dr. Cumming’s in which he opposes Roman Catholics, Puseyites, and infidels—pages which form the larger proportion of what he has published—for proof that the idea of God which both the logic and spirit of his discourses keep present to his hearers, is that of a God who hates his enemies, a God who teaches love by fierce denunciations of wrath—a God who encourages obedience to his precepts by elaborately revealing to us that his own government is in precise opposition to those precepts. We know the usual evasions on this subject. We know Dr. Cumming would say that even Roman Catholics are to be loved and succored as men; that he would help even that “unclean spirit,” Cardinal Wiseman, out of a ditch. But who that is in the slightest degree acquainted with the action of the human mind will believe that any genuine and large charity can grow out of an exercise of love which is always to have an arrière-pensée of hatred? Of what quality would be the conjugal love of a husband who loved his spouse as a wife, but hated her as a woman? It is reserved for the regenerate mind, according to Dr. Cumming’s conception of it, to be “wise, amazed, temperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment.” Precepts of charity uttered with a faint breath at the end of a sermon are perfectly futile, when all the force of the lungs has been spent in keeping the hearer’s mind fixed on the conception of his fellow-men not as fellow-sinners and fellow-sufferers, but as agents of hell, as automata through whom Satan plays his game upon earth—not on objects which call forth their reverence, their love, their hope of good even in the most strayed and perverted, but on a minute identification of human things with such symbols as the scarlet whore, the beast out of the abyss, scorpions whose sting is in their tails, men who have the mark of the beast, and unclean spirits like frogs. You might as well attempt to educate the child’s sense of beauty by hanging its nursery with the horrible and grotesque pictures in which the early painters represented the Last Judgment, as expect Christian graces to flourish on that prophetic interpretation which Dr. Cumming offers as the principal nutriment of his flock. Quite apart from the critical basis of that interpretation, quite apart from the degree of truth there may be in Dr. Cumming’s prognostications—questions into which we do not choose to enter—his use of prophecy must be à priori condemned in the judgment of right-minded persons, by its results as testified in the net moral effect of his sermons. The best minds that accept Christianity as a divinely inspired system, believe that the great end of the Gospel is not merely the saving but the educating of men’s souls, the creating within them of holy dispositions, the subduing of egoistical pretensions, and the perpetual enhancing of the desire that the will of God—a will synonymous with goodness and truth—may be done on earth. But what relation to all this has a system of interpretation which keeps the mind of the Christian in the position of a spectator at a gladiatorial show, of which Satan is the wild beast in the shape of the great red dragon, and two thirds of mankind the victims—the whole provided and got up by God for the edification of the saints? The demonstration that the Second Advent is at hand, if true, can have no really holy, spiritual effect; the highest state of mind inculcated by the Gospel is resignation to the disposal of God’s providence—“Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; whether we die, we die unto the Lord”—not an eagerness to see a temporal manifestation which shall confound the enemies of God and give exaltation to the saints; it is to dwell in Christ by spiritual communion with his nature, not to fix the date when He shall appear in the sky. Dr. Cumming’s delight in shadowing forth the downfall of the Man of Sin, in prognosticating the battle of Gog and Magog, and in advertising the pre-millennial Advent, is simply the transportation of political passions on to a so-called religious platform; it is the anticipation of the triumph of “our party,” accomplished by our principal men being “sent for” into the clouds. Let us be understood to speak in all seriousness. If we were in search of amusement, we should not seek for it by examining Dr. Cumming’s works in order to ridicule them. We are simply discharging a disagreeable duty in delivering our opinion that, judged by the highest standard even of orthodox Christianity, they are little calculated to produce— ...|$|R
