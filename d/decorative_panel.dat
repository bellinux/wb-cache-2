6000|$|Sometimes one {{is given}} [...] "Vistas." [...] Doors stand open, {{and you can}} see right away through [...] "The Nook" [...] into the garden. There is never a living soul about the place. The whole family has been sent out for a walk or locked up in the cellars. This strikes you as odd until you come to think the matter out. The modern man and woman is not artistic. I am not artistic--not what I call really artistic. I don't go well with Gobelin {{tapestry}} and warming-pans. I feel I don't. Robina is not artistic, not in that sense. I tried her once with a harpsichord I picked up cheap in Wardour Street, and a reproduction of a Roman stool. The thing was an utter failure. A cottage piano, with a photo-frame and a fern upon, it is what the soul cries out for in connection with Robina. Dick is not artistic. Dick does not go with peacocks' feathers and guitars. I can see Dick with a single peacock's feather at St. Giles's Fair, when the bulldogs are not looking; but the <b>decorative</b> <b>panel</b> of peacock's feathers is too much for him. I can imagine him with a banjo--but a guitar decorated with pink ribbons! To begin with he is not dressed for it. Unless a family be prepared to make themselves up as troubadours or cavaliers and to talk blank verse, I don't see how they can expect to be happy living in these fifteenth-century houses. The modern family--the old man in baggy trousers and a frock-coat he could not button if he tried to; the mother of figure distinctly Victorian; the boys in flannel suits and collars up to their ears; the girls in motor caps--are as incongruous in these mediaeval dwellings as a party of Cook's tourists drinking bottled beer in the streets of Pompeii.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the {{artifact}} known as the Bush Barrow Lozenge, and the smaller lozenge, {{has been shown to}} be based on a hexagon construction.
