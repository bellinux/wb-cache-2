Bridging the <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} <b>digital</b> <b>divide.</b> A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
25|$|The {{second level}} <b>digital</b> <b>divide,</b> also {{referred}} to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the internet from the producers of content. As the technological <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> is decreasing between those with access to the internet and those without, the meaning of the term <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> is evolving. Previously, <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with an increasing number of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.|$|E
40|$|This article {{critically}} reviews well-established {{and recent}} trends in <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> literature and research, highlighting new elements of divides {{and the related}} research and making recommendations about future research. First, it disentangles {{some aspects of the}} puzzling nature and ongoing importance of <b>digital</b> <b>divides.</b> It then discusses how the concept of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> has evolved {{over the last two decades}} and how research literature has examined it on the basis of different attempts at contextualisation. The article brings together theoretical and empirical insights and suggests that <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> be revisited so as to illustrate the need for less linear and more properly contextualised approaches to the concept and phenomenon of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> where technology, society and politics will be jointly taken into consideration to explain divides. It specifically proposes that <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> and the research into these be revisited so as to emphasise the critical role of socio-cultural and decision-making dynamics in structuring the adoption of ICT in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Thus, it argues that the web of cultural traits in a society, with its own gaps and disparities, as well as policy and regulation dynamics, are in a constant dialogue with technology, together influencing <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> and entailing implications for other forms of division in societyPeer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{up to date}} {{findings on}} the nature, extent and sources of inequality in children s internet access and use across Europe, explaining these where possible and concluding with the key question, how much {{and what kind of}} continuing divides really matter and for whom? In the first section, the chapter opens the discussion by presenting briefly how research literature reports on <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> {{over the last two decades}} in terms of nature, extent and aspects of prominence. The second section extends the opening discussion of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> and presents literature which explores emerging aspects of divides and mediating factors shaping the ways in which children engage with ICTs. The aim is to decipher conceptualizations of childhood in terms of digital rights, empowerment and learning expectations. This literature-grounded discussion is coupled with a review of how research over the last decade approaches <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> among children and what aspects of divides have been researched most in Europe. Then, the third section analyses and discusses the latest empirical data available in Europe, aiming to take into consideration the above developments in the conceptualization and research of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> and to conclude about the extent and nature of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> that children face in Europe today. The focus of this discussion of research findings in Europe is on the sources of divides (e. g. socio-economics), as well as on the nature and extent (i. e. geographic divisions and adults vs children) of the phenomenon in Europe. The chapter concludes by answering the question: how much and what kinds of continuing divides really matter and for whom?, reflecting back on what we know already from literature on the extent and significance of <b>digital</b> <b>divides.</b> The contribution of the chapter lies in the provision of up to data about the actual picture of <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> among children in Europe today, while linking this to how research and literature in the field have evolved...|$|R

25|$|The gap {{caused by}} the <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China {{and the rest of}} the world is closing. However, the <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens are faced with the issues of the <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> because of their income, education, or location. While China has made great strides in improving the country's communication infrastructure as well as narrowing the overall <b>digital</b> <b>divide,</b> there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the information society has accentuated the importance of <b>digital</b> <b>divides,</b> which refer to economic and social inequalities among populations {{due to differences in}} access to, use of, or knowledge of information and communication technologies (ICT). This book discusses the current state of <b>digital</b> <b>divides,</b> ranging from global challenges in universal access to new opportunities for greater digital inclusiveness (e-inclusion). The first part of the book illustrates current challenges and provides examples from emerging markets and developed countries alike. It covers <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> facing a developing country like Ghana and the range of divides in large places like Australia, China, and Russia. It also discusses <b>digital</b> skill <b>divides</b> in Europe and the <b>digital</b> gender <b>divide,</b> which shows that there are more men online than women. The second part of the book focuses on e-inclusion and describes recent efforts to bridge <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> through a number of initiatives. It explores the inclusion programs in Singapore, the efforts in India to leverage mobile devices, and how a UK nongovernmental organization attempts to bridge existing gaps there. It also assesses programs in several countries that provide computers to youth. The book concludes with a view toward the future, including challenges in determining outcomes in ICT for development (ICT 4 D) and anticipated new divides. It introduces the cyber dependency matrix to illustrate where countries are in their journey toward an information society and what happens as they reach higher levels. Emerging concerns include a global information divide, courtesy of cyber security and data policies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} presented, the author {{considers}} few {{aspects of the}} so-called “digital divide”. It is easily noticeable worldwide, that new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) “possess” a great ability to spread, at high pace, among countries from all around the world. At the same time, we can see that ICTs are being implemented at different pace in difference economies. Different pace of ICTs implementation generates significant inequalities in level of usage and application of these technologies in different countries. The main purpose of the paper is to assess magnitude of existing <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> among countries, which can partly explain existing inequalities in use and application of ICTs. The author will apply relevant methodology – taken from basic taxonomy methodology – to measure the <b>digital</b> <b>divides</b> among economies.
