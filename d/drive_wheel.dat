5|$|In 2007 the {{telescope}} {{needed a new}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{as one of the}} 64 original wheels had cracked; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a second wheel cracked. These are the only two wheel changes needed since {{the telescope}} started operation in 1957.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the motion}} gear rings {{and the upper}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> both had 600 teeth, which by Su's {{mathematical}} precision carefully calculated measured units {{of the day in}} a division of 1/600. These gears, having 600 teeth, thus ensured the division of the day into measurements of 2 minutes and 24 seconds each.|$|E

40|$|Improved {{cable grip}} reduces wear due to sliding {{friction}} between cable and gripping surfaces. <b>Drive</b> <b>wheels</b> are grooved with a helical pattern that meshes with {{the lay of}} cable, analogous to a worm gear. Cable is gripped between <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> and guide rollers, and cable pull is exerted on the grip when <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> are slowed by hydraulic clutches. Cable grip may be applicable to cable-operated systems, such as ore trams in mines, overhead cable cars and ski lifts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tractive efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles {{in general and}} the slip efficiency in particular. It focuses on the analysis of the conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency. Results of detailed theoretical analyses indicate that all <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip will be the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the optimal slip efficiency, if their thrust-slip relationships are either linear or nonlinear with similar characteristics. If the thrust-slip relationships of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> are nonlinear with different characteristics, the optimal slip efficiency will be reached with the slips of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> not being equal. The basic findings of this investigation are substantiated with experimental data. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the requirement for all <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> operating at the same slip provides a reasonable basis for a practical control strategy of an active system to distribute torque (thrust) among the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to achieve the optimal (or close to the optimal) slip efficiency of all-wheel-drive vehicles under most operating conditions.

2500|$|In {{automobiles}} and other wheeled vehicles, the differential allows the outer <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to rotate {{faster than the}} inner <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> during a turn. [...] This is necessary when the vehicle turns, making the wheel that is traveling around {{the outside of the}} turning curve roll farther and faster than the other. [...] The average of the rotational speed of the two driving wheels equals the input rotational speed of the drive shaft. [...] An increase in the speed of one wheel is balanced by a decrease in the speed of the other.|$|E

2500|$|The {{engine of}} an Exeter Express lost a tyre from a [...] <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> near Southall. It killed two passers-by and derailed a goods train {{on the other}} track.

2500|$|The scooter had rigid rear {{suspension}} and small [...] wheels that allowed a compact design {{and plenty of}} room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's cooling fins. [...] The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Henry Ford's enthusiasm for reentering the tractor market was growing, {{but he still}} {{did not have a}} design or {{features}} that could ensure a runaway, market-changing success. His idea for a tractor with one large <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> was extensively developed, but the prototypes did not perform well. Various people who worked on it have wondered whether it was just a ruse to mislead Ford's competitors about his real intentions for a coming model, but it seems that he was quite serious about it and was probably disappointed that it did not work out; if it had worked, {{it would have been a}} powerful fulfillment of his penchant for simplicity and very low cost.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{at least}} four {{different}} methods for measuring gear ratios: gear inches, metres of development (roll-out), gain ratio, and quoting the number of teeth {{on the front and}} rear sprockets respectively. The first three methods result in each possible gear ratio being represented by a single number which allows the gearing of any bicycles to be compared; the numbers produced by different methods are not comparable, but for each method the larger the number the higher the gear. The fourth method uses two numbers and is only useful in comparing bicycles with the same <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter. [...] In the case of road bikes, this is usually around 670mm. [...] A 700c [...] "standard" [...] wheel has a 622mm rim diameter. [...] The final wheel diameter depends on the specific tire but will be approximately 622mm plus twice the tire width.|$|E
2500|$|Two full Stargate props were {{originally}} {{built for the}} SG-1 pilot , the second of which was reconstructed from the prop used in the film. [...] They are made of steel and fiberglass, and are [...] in diameter. The second prop is less detailed, and is used for exterior scenes; in the pilot it was used solely on the planet Chulak. The primary one is fully automated and capable of rotating and emitting light. [...] This is achieved {{by the use of}} a specially designed [...] circular gear, which turns the inner ring on a precise pinion <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> using an eight horsepower electric motor. The top seven chevrons emit laser pulses which are read by a sensor fed into a computer responsible for the gate's movement, which is consequently able to start and stop the rotation very quickly. This main prop is kept almost immovably at the permanent set of the SGC, at Bridge Studios, Vancouver.|$|E
2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treadle. This nonsense may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman could have said correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a loom, these reciprocating beams were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|E
