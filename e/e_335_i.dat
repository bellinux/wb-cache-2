40|$|AbstractIt is {{controversial}} whether mutation in the melancortin- 3 receptor (MC 3 R) gene {{is a cause}} for monogenic obesity in humans. Three novel mutations in the MC 3 R, A 293 T, <b>I</b> <b>335</b> S, and X 361 S, were identified from morbidly obese subjects. We investigated whether these mutations caused loss-of-function and the molecular defects if any. Ligand binding, signaling, and cell surface expression of the mutant MC 3 Rs were studied. <b>I</b> <b>335</b> S resulted in a complete loss of ligand binding and signaling due to intracellular retention. A 293 T and X 361 S MC 3 Rs had normal ligand binding and signaling as wild type MC 3 R. Co-expression studies showed that the mutants did not affect wild type MC 3 R signaling. Hence the <b>I</b> <b>335</b> S variant previously identified from obese patients is not expressed at the cell surface when expressed in vitro, suggesting that it might contribute to obesity in carriers of this variant. Whether A 293 T and X 361 S cause obesity remains to be investigated.

Methods: Two hundred five patients with SSc and 255 healthy controls were screened for polymorphisms in EDN 1, EDNRA, and EDNRB, using sequence-specific primer–polymerase chain reaction. The polymorphisms studied were at the following positions: for EDN 1, − 1370 (T- 1370 G) of the promoter, + 138 of exon 1 (+ 138 A/−), + 85 of exon 3 (E 106 E), and + 23 of exon 5 (K 198 N); for EDNRA, − 231 of exon 1 (G- 231 A), and + 69 (H 323 H) and + 105 (<b>E</b> <b>335</b> <b>E)</b> of exon 6; for EDNRB, + 2841 of exon 2 (EDNRB- 3), − 2547 of exon 3 (EDNRB- 2), and − 2446 of exon 3 (EDNRB- 1). Results: No {{significant differences between the}} SSc group as a whole and control subjects were observed for any of the investigated polymorphisms in EDN 1, EDNRA, and EDNRB. However, compared with patients with limited cutaneous SSc, patients with diffuse skin involvement had an increased frequency of allele carriage of EDNRB- 1 A (76. 8 % versus 54. 4 %; P = 0. 002), EDNRB- 2 A (79. 7 % versus 60. 2 %; P = 0. 006), and EDNRB- 3 G (79. 7 % versus 56. 6 %; P = 0. 001).

40|$|Two {{proteins}} {{important in}} transcriptional regulation and apoptotic modulation are RelB and Daxx. Previously, {{it was shown}} that Daxx induced apoptosis through interaction with RelB to silence Daxx transcriptional activity. The main focus {{of this study was}} to identify the binding domains required for such interaction and to purify the recombinant RelB:Daxx heterodimer from E. coli for x-ray crystallography analysis. The findings showed that Daxx DHBI (56 - 144) region interacts with RelB DD (277 - 391). This finding was confirmed through GST pulldown analysis with different fragments of Daxx and RelB. Some of the RelB DD mutants (<b>I</b> <b>335</b> F; <b>I</b> 286 M, <b>I</b> <b>335</b> F; and Y 300 F, <b>I</b> <b>335</b> F) which can enhance the binding ability of RelB DD were shown to abrupt the interaction with Daxx DHBI.

While Daxx and RelB are known to interact with each other to induce apoptosis, the binding affinity is not strong enough perhaps due to competition with other NF[kappa]B factors binding to the open interface of RelB DD. In order to get a more stable Daxx:RelB complex, future studies can focus on the expression and purification of Daxx N-terminus (1 - 400) and RelB RHR (1 - 400) complex.

High cutting forces are generated when using sintered corundum, and white electrocorundum. Due to the geometry of the abrasive grain is more advantageous to use diamond or cubic boron nitride material. The porosity of the grinding wheel also affects the resulting machine tool load and technological areas. The greater the porosity is, the lower the value of cutting forces is. Unfortunately, with the porosity increases significantly an average roughness. These grinding wheels are suitable for roughing. The higher value of porosity ensures colder cut and smaller heat affected surfaces. Surface quality, while maintaining other process conditions are best when using white electrocorundum, slightly is impaired for other abrasive materials.

All of the fabricated samples showed highly porous structures, consisting of fully dense PZT–PZN walls without defects, such as cracks or pores. As the initial solid loading was decreased from 25 to 10 vol%, the porosity was linearly in-creased from 50 % to 82 %. This increase in the porosity led to a reduction in the permittivity, a moderate decline in the d 33 value, and a rapid decline in the d 31 value, which endowed the porous samples with a high hydrostatic figure of merit (HFOM).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical and mineralogical data on Holocene {{coastal plain}} soils from Thailand suggest hat during {{formation}} of pyrite in tidal swamps Fe(III) is extracted from smectite {{and replaced by}} Mg. During drainage of these sediments pyrite oxidizes and the reaction is reversed. Replacing Fe(III) by Mg in clay minerals tores alkalinity that can neutralize three-quarters of the acidity released during oxidation of pyrite, and thus lowers the potential acidity of pyritic sediments. Possible causes for variation in the amounts of Mg taken up during pyrite formation are discussed. Drever (1971) suggested that in anoxic sea bottom sediments Fe is extracted from smectite during formation of pyrite, and is replaced by Mg from solution.

40|$|Neutralization escape mutant {{has played}} an {{important}} role in antigenic evolution of various virus-causing diseases. DENV, the causative agent of dengue has been shown to escape antibody neutralization, thereby causing an epidemic outbreak. The pattern through which DENV escape neutralization that leads to antigenic evolution, however, has not been thoroughly investigated in hyper endemic countries. It is hypothesized that, the highly susceptible DENV demonstrates a clear pattern of antigenic evolution from being minor strains (less frequent during an outbreak) to dominant strains (very frequent during an outbreak). This suggests that the minor strains may act as a springboard for the emergence of more virulent dominant strains by acquiring some characteristics of the minor strains. Hence, the overall objective of the present study is to provide an insight into the antigenic evolution of DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 in Malaysia. To investigate this possibility, the present study used truncated DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 recombinant E, cloned and expressed on phage M 13 g 3 p attachment protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis, six single mutations were engineered separately onto the respective recombinant E gene. Effects of these mutations on binding to insects and mammalian cells were determined in vitro. The polyclonal antibodies generated against these recombinant proteins in BALB/c mice were used in microneutralization and Foci Reduction Neutralization Test to evaluate neutralizing antibody determinant associated with antigenic evolution. Serial propagation in vitro was adopted to handpick the neutralization escape mutant in the sub-neutralizing antibody concentration. To evaluate potential host where the selection occurs, the escape mutant were adapted to mimic mosquito and human cycle in vitro. Finding from the present study shows that two mutations (E 272 and E 390) on DENV- 1 E were demonstrated to affect binding of the recombinant proteins to C 6 / 36 mosquito and Vero cells. Polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant E 272 and E 390 proteins exhibited decreased binding to DENV- 1 virion. The polyclonal antibodies reduced the number of DENV- 1 foci formed up to four-folds for the five endemic DENV- 1 strains (GIa, GIb, GIc, GII and GIII) tested. Two DENV- 1 isolates likely to escape neutralization were identified; D 1. 10245 (GII) and D 1. 11177 (GIb). In DENV- 2, mutations on E 52, E 164 and E 393 were demonstrated to affect binding of the recombinant proteins to C 6 / 36 mosquito and Vero cells. Polyclonal antibodies generated in mice against recombinant E 52, E 164 and E 176 exhibited decreased binding to DENV- 2 (Asian 1 strain) and E 164 and <b>E</b> <b>335</b> on one of the Cosmopolitan strain.

Evidence from the present study show that the neutralization escape strains from DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 alternating between two different hosts adapts differently. The observed difference in DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 on C 6 / 36 and Vero cells was evident in the variation in amino acid residues on E. Of these 6 mutations engineered on DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 recombinant E, substitution on EDI/EDII junction are likely to facilitates antigenic evolution of DENV- 1 (E 272) and DENV- 2 (E 52 and E 71) in Malaysia. Overall, the study identified dominant DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 strains expected to evolve in Malaysian natural population in the future. The antigenic determinants involved were identified. The result of the study directly underlines the effects of these mutations on naturally emerging DENV- 1 and DENV- 2 in Malaysian population and its implications on dengue affliction and vaccines design...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) apparently forms Cl− {{channels in}} apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells. A detailed model describes molecular structure and biophysical properties of CFTR {{and the impact}} of various mutations as they occur in cystic fibrosis. In the present report mutations were introduced into the putative 6 th α-helical transmembrane pore forming domain of CFTR. The mutants were subsequently expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of the respective cRNAs. Whole cell (wc) conductances could be reversibly activated by IBMX (1 mmol/l) only in oocytes injected with wild-type (wt) or mutant CFTR but not in oocytes injected with water or antisense CFTR. The activated conductance was partially inhibited by (each 100 μmol/l) DIDS (27 %) and glibenclamide (77 %), but not by 10 μmol/l NPPB. The following mutations were examined: K <b>335</b> <b>E,</b> R 347 E, R 334 <b>E,</b> K <b>335</b> H, R 347 H, R 334 H. They did not measurably change the wt-CFTR anion permeability (P) and wc conductance (G) sequence of: PCl− >PBr− >P 1 − and GCl− >GBr− >G 1 −, respectively. Moreover, anomalous mole fraction behavior for the cAMP activated current could not be detected: neither in wt-CFTR nor in R 347 E-CFTR. Various mutants for which positively charged amino acids were replaced by histidines (K 335 H, R 347 H, R 334 H) did not show pH sensitivity of the IBMX activated wc conductance. We, therefore, cannot confirm previous results. CFTR might have a different molecular structure than previously suggested or it might act as a regulator of ion conductances...|$|R
