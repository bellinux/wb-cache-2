5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> built-up area of central Reading, {{on the site of the}} former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from English Heritage and Philippa Langley, who aided with the successful exhumation of Richard III.|$|E

5|$|The {{hotel was}} leased on 26 August 1867 for {{the terms of}} 999 years at yearly rent of Rupees 92 and 12 annas to Abdul Haq. It was closed in the 1960s and was later {{subdivided}} and partitioned into smaller cubicles that were let out on rent as homes and offices. Neglect of the building has resulted in decay and, despite its listing as a Grade II–A heritage structure, the building <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated state.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|After Watson's death, {{the hotel}} lost its {{popularity}} to the rival Taj Hotel. In the 1960s {{the hotel was}} closed. Sometime after this, it was subdivided and partitioned into small cubicles with independent access and let out on rent.

With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the Midlands and further afield, on works outings and bank holidays. Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer. To cater for them, Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday amusement arcades, tea rooms, amusement rides and a photographic studio. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> derelict state and has been added to English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register, but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire. It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the Isca Foundry of Newport, Monmouthshire. It is a grade II* listed building.|$|E

The concept of one's own culture <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of change due to globalization.
