40|$|First, we fill in key gaps in Steiner's nice {{characterization}} of the most nearly circular ellipse which passes through the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, D. Steiner proved {{that there is only}} one pair of conjugate directions, M 1 and M 2, that belong to all <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> circumscription. Then he proves that if there is an ellipse, E, whose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M 1 and M 2, then E must be an <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> circumscription which has minimal eccentricity. However, Steiner does not show the existence or uniqueness <b>of</b> such an <b>ellipse.</b> We prove that there is a unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity which passes through the vertices of D. We also show that there exists an ellipse which passes through the vertices of D and whose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M 1 and M 2. We also show that there exists a unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal area which passes through the vertices of D. Finally, we call a convex quadrilateral, D, bielliptic if the unique inscribed and circumscribed <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity have the same eccentricity. This generalizes the notion of bicentric quadrilaterals. In particular we show the existence of a bielliptic convex quadrilateral which is not bicentric.

40|$|We {{prove that}} {{there exists a}} unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in a parallelogram, D. We also prove that the {{smallest}} nonnegative angle between equal conjugate diameters of E_{I} equals the smallest nonnegative angle between the diagonals of D. We also prove that if E_{M} is the unique ellipse inscribed in a rectangle, R, which is tangent at the midpoints of the sides of R, then E_{M} is the unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, maximal area, and maximal arc length inscribed in R. Let D be any convex quadrilateral. In previous papers, the author proved {{that there is a}} unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in D, and a unique <b>ellipse,</b> E_{O}, <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity circumscribed about D. We defined D to be bielliptic if E_{I} and E_{O} have the same eccentricity. In this paper we show that a parallelogram, D, is bielliptic if and only if the square of the length of one of the diagonals of D equals twice the square of the length of one of the sides of D.

40|$|This paper proposes {{two methods}} for {{analyzing}} error propagation in overlay analysis of vector polygons, an analytical and simulation method. First, for the analytical method, the error is derived {{based on the}} error propagation law in statistics. In the second method, error propagation of overlay is simulated based on the positional error of the original polygon vertices, assuming a given error distribution of the vertices. For both methods, several geometrical error measures for the derived polygons are defined: (i) error measures for the perimeter, area and center of gravity of a polygon, and (ii) the error intervals for the polygon vertices. A test is performed to compare {{the differences between the}} two methods and their applicability. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in estimating the propagated error between the two methods. However, these two methods are suitable for different cases. The analytical method is applicable when the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any intersection point of the original polygons does not intersect with error <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> all the vertices of the original polygons, if the intersection point exists; or, in case of disjoint polygon boundaries, the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any point on the boundary of one original polygon does not intersect with the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any point on the boundary of the other original polygons. On the other hand, the simulation method is more generic, but more time consuming. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R
40|$|As {{fluconazole}} resistance {{becomes an}} emerging issue for treating infections caused by Candida tropicalis, searching for alternative becomes a prominent task. In the present study, 97 clinical isolates of C. tropicalis were {{tested for the}} susceptibilities to flucytosine (5 FC) with the Etest method. Although only one isolate was resistant to 5 FC, 30 susceptible isolates could produce resistant progeny after exposure to the drug. Interestingly, 22 of these 30 clinical isolates had a heterozygous G/T at the 145 th position on FCY 2, encoding purine-cytosine permease, whereas their progeny recovered from within the inhibitory ellipses had homozygous T/T, resulting in null alleles for both copies of the gene and produced only truncated proteins, effecting the 5 FC resistance. Furthermore, we found that two major fluconazole-resistant clinical clones, diploid sequence type 98 (DST 98) and DST 140, had a homozygous G/G at the 145 th position, and neither was able to produce 5 FC-resistant progeny within the inhibitory <b>ellipses.</b> Hence, <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> C. tropicalis containing heterozygous alleles may develop 5 FC resistance readily, whereas those with homozygous G/G wild-type alleles can be treated with 5 FC. Subsequently, a combination of 5 FC and another antifungal drug is applicable for treating infections of C. tropicalis...|$|R
