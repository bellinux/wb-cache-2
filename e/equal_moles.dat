40|$|The study {{systematically}} investigates a catalyst-free {{method of}} producing H- 2 by mixing low-grade Mg scraps (LGMS) in aqueous organic acids. A concave downward relationship {{exists between the}} hydrogen yield and the citric acid concentration in seawater. The H- 2 yield was highest when the seawater contained 30 wt% citric acid. Activation energy for the H- 2 generation in citric acid-added seawater was calculated. H+ mobility and H+ concentration in citric acid aqueous affect the total H- 2 yield, causing that the highest yield occurred at some intermediate citric acid concentration. A concave downward relationship existed between the H- 2 yield and NaCl concentration in citric acid solution. NaCl concentration had strong effect on H- 2 yield in citric acid solution but {{did not have the}} effect on the H- 2 yield in acetic acid solution. The H- 2 generation rate from the Mg scraps in 15 wt% acetic acid solution evidently exceeded that in 15 wt% citric acid solution although the two solutions each had approximately <b>equal</b> <b>moles</b> of dissociable hydrogen atoms.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{extremely}} small and circular supercoiled vectors has opened new territory for improving non-viral gene therapy vectors. In this work, we compared transfection of supercoiled DNA vectors ranging from 383 to 4, 548 bp, each encoding shRNA against GFP under control of the H 1 promoter. We assessed knockdown of GFP by electroporation into HeLa cells. All of our vectors entered cells in comparable numbers when electroporated with <b>equal</b> <b>moles</b> of DNA. Despite similar cell entry, we found length-dependent differences in how efficiently the vectors knocked down GFP. As vector length increased up to 1, 869 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole of transfected DNA increased. From 1, 869 to 4, 257 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole was steady, then decreased with increasing vector length. In comparing GFP knockdown with equal masses of vectors, {{we found that the}} shorter vectors transfect more efficiently per nanogram of DNA transfected. Our results rule out cell entry and DNA mass as determining factors for gene knockdown efficiency via electroporation. The length-dependent effects we have uncovered are likely explained by differences in nuclear translocation or transcription.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the ratio of available methionine (MET) to methionine plus cysteine (TSAA) intake and wholebody protein deposition (PD) was established using the nitrogen (N) balance technique in gilts between 40 and 80 kg live body weight (BW), according to a repeated 5 × 5 Latin square design. Pigs were fed casein- and cornstarch-based diets that supplied <b>equal</b> <b>moles</b> of TSAA supporting a PD of approximately 80 % of the gilts’ PD potential. On a weight basis, the target ratios of MET to TSAA were 42, 47, 52, 57 and 67 % for the five experimental diets, respectively. This calculated to 37, 42, 47, 52 and 62. 5 % on a molar basis. Total N excretion (urine plus feces) was reduced (linear; P 0. 05) when the MET to TSAA ratio was further increased. A number of statistical models were fitted to the data to establish the best fit of the model parameters. The greatest proportion of the variation (R 2 = 0. 990) was explained with an asymptotic model; based on this model the optimum available MET to TSAA ratio (supporting 90 % of the asymptotic value for PD) was 55 % on a weight basis or 50. 5 % on a molar basis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sphingomyelin (SM) {{is present}} in dietary {{products}} and cell plasma membranes. We previously showed that dietary SM inhibited cholesterol absorption in rats. In the intestinal tract, SM is mainly hydrolyzed by alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) to ceramide. AIMS: We investigated the influence of SM and its hydrolytic products ceramide and sphingosine on cholesterol uptake in intestinal Caco- 2 cells. METHODS: Micelles containing bile salt, monoolein, and (14) C-cholesterol were prepared with or without SM, ceramide, or sphingosine. The micelles were incubated with Caco- 2 cells, and uptake of radioactive cholesterol was quantified. RESULTS: We found that confluent monolayer Caco- 2 cells expressed NPC 1 L 1, and the uptake of cholesterol in the cells was inhibited by ezetimibe, a specific inhibitor of NPC 1 L 1. Incorporation of SM in the cholesterol micelles inhibited cholesterol uptake dose-dependently; 38 % inhibition occurred at an <b>equal</b> <b>mole</b> ratio of SM and cholesterol. The inhibition was further enhanced to 45 % by pretreating the cholesterol/SM micelles with recombinant alk-SMase, which hydrolyzed SM in the micelles by 85 %, indicating ceramide has stronger inhibitory effects on cholesterol uptake. To confirm this, we further replaced SM in the micelles with ceramide and sphingosine, and found that at <b>equal</b> <b>mole</b> ratio to cholesterol, ceramide exhibited stronger inhibitory effect (50 % vs 38 %) on cholesterol uptake than SM, whereas sphingosine only had a weak effect at high concentrations. CONCLUSION: Both SM and ceramide inhibit cholesterol uptake, the effect of ceramide being stronger than that of SM. Alk-SMase enhances SM-induced inhibition of cholesterol uptake by generating ceramide in the intestinal lumen...|$|R
40|$|Materials with nanostructured {{conducting}} domains {{are essential}} {{for a wide range}} of applications related to alternative energy. Active materials in battery and fuel cell electrodes such as LiFePO 4, graphite, and platinum, are either electronic or ionic insulators. Nanoscale electron- and ion-conducting domains are necessary for enabling redox reactions in these materials. For example, a traditional porous lithium battery electrode consists of a redox-active material, carbon black for electronic conduction, and non-conductive binder that holds the particles in place. The pores are backfilled filled with organic electrolyte for ionic conduction. In some cases such as LiFePO 4, electronic and ionic conductivities are so low that the active materials must be in nanoparticle form, and addressing such particles requires the transport of both kinds of charges to occur on nanometer length scales. Materials such as block copolymers can self-assemble and form co-continuous nanoscale domains. In this study, poly(3 -alkylthiophene) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P 3 AT-PEO) copolymers are used to conducts both electronic and ionic charges. P 3 AT-PEO block copolymer molecules self-assemble on the nanometer length scale to yield P 3 AT-domains that conduct electronic charges and PEO-domains that conduct ionic charges. We propose to create a unique battery electrode where the LiFePO 4 active material is dispersed in a nanostructured P 3 AT-PEO block copolymer, which functions simultaneously as the conductor of lithium ions and electronic charge, as well as the binder material in the electrode. 	The first phase of this dissertation work involved the synthesis of P 3 AT-PEO block copolymers. Regioregular P 3 ATs were synthesized using the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization method where in-situ end-group functionalization was employed to obtain ethynyl-functionalized P 3 ATs. Azide-functionalized PEOs were obtained through end-group modification of PEO monomethyl ether. Ethynyl-functionalized P 3 ATs and azide-functionalized P 3 AT-PEO were coupled using 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition "click" reaction to obtain P 3 AT-PEO block copolymer. In particular, poly(3 -hexylthiophene) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P 3 HT-b-PEO) copolymers and a poly(3 -ethylhexylthiophene) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P 3 EHT-b-PEO) copolymer were synthesized in this study. 	Next, the morphology of the P 3 AT-b-PEO copolymer was characterized using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The morphologies of P 3 HT-b-PEO copolymers, where the P 3 HT block is the major component, are dominated by nanofibrils due to the crystallization of P 3 HT. In contrast, the nearly symmetric P 3 HT-b-PEO copolymers self-assemble into a lamellar phase. In addition, we show that P 3 EHT-b-PEO chains self-assemble to produce traditional nanoscale morphologies such as lamellae and gyroid in the melt-state. The segregation strength between the two blocks is controlled through the addition of lithium bis(trifluromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI). Our approach enables estimation of the "effective" Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, $chi eff, using the random phase approximation (RPA). The $chi eff trends with salt concentration suggest that the TFSI anion preferentially segregates into the P 3 EHT phase while Li + remains in the PEO phase. For the salt-free sample, the gyroid morphology, obtained in the melt-state, is transformed into lamellae when the P 3 EHT block is crystallized. This is due to the "breaking out" of the crystalline phase. At high salt concentrations, P 3 EHT-b-PEO has a lamellar morphology in both melt and crystalline states (confined crystallization). 	We present the first reported study on the relationship between morphology and electronic/ionic charge transport of P 3 HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixtures. Using ac impedance spectroscopy, we show that P 3 HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixtures can conduct electronic and ionic charges simultaneously. At 90 °C, the electronic conductivity of P 3 HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixtures ranged from 10 - 8 to 10 - 5 S/cm depending on the volume fraction of P 3 HT. The decoupled ionic conductivity is around ~ 10 - 4 S/cm. It was shown that LiTFSI partitions between P 3 HT and PEO microphases. In particular, LiTFSI only partitions between the microphases when the PEO block molecular weight is 2 kg/mol while we observe no partitioning when the PEO block molecular weight of 4. 2 kg/mol. It thus appears that the chemical potential of LiTFSI in PEO is a function of the PEO block molecular weight. We propose that the higher chemical potential of LiTFSI for P 3 HT-b-PEO copolymers with PEO molecular weight of 2 kg/mol drives the LiTFSI into the P 3 HT rich microphase. 	The electronic conductivity can be further increased by electrochemically chemically doping the P 3 HT chains with LiTFSI. Therefore, we quantified the electronic conductivity P 3 HT-b-PEO copolymers electrochemically oxidized with LiTFSI. We use a novel solid-state three-terminal electrochemical cell that enables simultaneous conductivity measurements and control over electrochemical doping of P 3 HT. At low oxidation levels, the electronic conductivity increases from 10 - 8 S/cm to 10 - 4 S/cm. At high oxidation levels, the electronic conductivity approaches 10 - 2 S/cm. These values match or exceed the ionic conductivity, which is important for enabling redox reactions in a battery as they involve <b>equal</b> <b>moles</b> of lithium ions and electronic charges. 	A lithium metal battery was assembled where the positive electrode consisted of P 3 HT-b-PEO conductive binder and LiFePO 4 active material. We were able to cycle batteries and obtain capacities approaching the theoretical limit of LiFePO 4. Importantly, P 3 HT is electroactive within the voltage window of a charge/discharge cycle. The electronic conductivity of the P 3 HT-b-PEO copolymer binder is in the 10 - 4 to 10 - 2 S/cm range over most of the potential window of the charge/discharge cycle. This allows for efficient electronic conduction needed for the successful cycling of the batteries. However, at the end of the discharge cycle, the electronic conductivity decreases sharply to 10 - 7 S/cm, which means the "conductive" binder is now electronically insulating. The ability of our conductive binder to switch between electronically conducting and insulating states in the positive electrode provides an unprecedented route for automatic overdischarge protection in batteries...|$|E
40|$|In this research, two green {{chemical}} processes for synthesizing intermediates for polyurethane-urea {{have been developed}} successfully. Firstly, environmental friendly processes of non-phosgene approach to two 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamates and isocyanate-free routes based on these intermediates to urea-prepolymers and polyureas have been devised. Secondly, one-pot reaction process with digestion and alkoxylation of the polycarbonate wastes conversion into bishydroxyalky ethers of bisphenol A for use as polyurethane raw materials also have been developed. In the part one of my study, I worked out a practical synthesis of amine-terminated urea prepolymers and polyureas through the amination of dimethyl 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamate (4, 4 '-DM-MDC) and diphenyl 4, 4 '-methylene diphenylcarbamate (4, 4 '-DP-MDC) in a novel non-phosgene route. The preparation of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC was achieved by condensation of methyl N-phenylcarbamate with formaldehyde using concentrated hydrochloric acid as a promotor in a methanol solution at 30 oC. Under these conditions, the result has improved to a 91 % conversion based on methyl N-phenylcarbamate with the selectivity of 2, 4 '-DM-MDC at 2 % and 4, 4 '-DM-MDC at 91 %. On the other hand, we performed a carbonylation of 4, 4 '-methylenedianiline (4, 4 '-MDA) with diphenyl carbonate with pivalic acid at 80 oC as the catalyst to achieve the highest yield of 94 % for 4, 4 '-DP-MDC. Amination of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC with high boiling-point polyetherdiamines resulted in rapid removal of methanol at around 160 oC to produce amine terminated urea-prepolymers which by reaction with a diisocyanate such as diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI), formed polyureas. This approach however, failed to give high molecular weight polyureas directly when <b>equal</b> <b>moles</b> of short-chained diamines and 4, 4 '-DM-MDC were mixed in a one-pot reaction process. On the other hand, amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC {{was found to be}} more efficient than those of 4, 4 '-DM-MDC, and could be used for both polyureas and a hydroxyl terminated urea-prepolymer synthesis. The preparation of hydroxyl terminated urea-prepolymer, like 4, 4 '-diphenylmethanebis-[(2 -hydroxyethyl) urea] for instance, can be prepared in high yield of 97 % in minutes, from amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC and ethanol amine. More conveniently, a one-pot amination of 4, 4 '-DP-MDC with a diamine or mixed diamines was also found to be an excellent method for the preparation of high molecular weight polyureas. Thus, the amination approach using 4, 4 '-DP-MDC as the key intermediate provides a general and excellent green chemistry route for introducing methylene diphenylene units into urea-prepolymers and polyurea elastomers without using phosgene or diphenylmethane diisocyanate in the overall process An efficient process of the chemical recycling of polycarbonate (PC) waste into diols of bis-phenol A (BPA) for use as raw materials in PU production also has been developed. This is another development of green process of making PU intermediates through waste materials. Digestion of PC waste in alkylene glycols, i. e., ethylene glycol (EG) and propylene glycol (PG), with catalytic amount of sodium carbonate at 180 oC under normal atmosphere pressure afforded partial alkoxylation products of BPA. This initial product mixture was found to be consisting of BPA (28 %) and monohydroxyethyl ether (MHE-BPA, 40 %) and bishydroxyethyl ether of bisphenol A (BHE-BPA, 25 %) when digested in EG solution. Whereas, in PG digestion solution, the corressponding digestion products consist of monohydroxyproply ether of BPA (MHP-BPA, 53 %) and bishydroxypropyl ether of BPA (BHP-BPA, 21 %) with the rest being un-propoxylated BPA (26 %). When these digested solutions were further treated with molar excess of urea with a catalytic amount of zinc oxide at 180 oC, BHE from EG or BHP-BPA from PG was produced in high yields. In both digestion processes, cyclic alkylene carbonates, i. e. ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PPC), were observed as the transient intermediates which eventually disappears during the prolonged alkoxylation conditions. ZnO was added to the second step as the catalyst to accelerate urea's trans-esterification process. Both BHE and BHP products have been successfully utilized in making PU polymers of good mechanical properties. This chemical approach thus provides a viable alternative for PC recycling.

In the mixture, the β region extends to very high pressures. The maximum amount of krypton dissolving in β-nitrogen is about 85 %. As a consequence, the regions where the fcc-Kr lattice and the δ lattice of nitrogen are stable are relatively small.

The most interesting aspect is that in the β solid the line width is extremely composition dependent, with maximum values for the mixture with <b>equal</b> <b>mole</b> fractions.

Primer-II containing 0. 1, 1. 0 or 5. 0 wt% compound of pA and pB were assigned to the experimental groups 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6, respectively. In all experimental groups, CSE bond containing 10 wt% hydroxyapatite powder was used as the experimental bonding agent. The positive control teeth were capped with calcium hydroxide preparation (Dycal), and the negative control teeth were capped with CSE. The specimens were alternately stained with Mayer's H&E and the enhanced polymer one-step staining method. Experimental groups 1, 4, 5 and 6 showed a higher level of reparative dentin formation compared to the negative control 14 days postoperatively. At 28 days postoperatively, all experimental groups showed the formation of extensive reparative dentin, and experimental groups 4, 5 and 6 demonstrated similar dentin bridge formation as that of the positive control. How quickly reparative dentin formation occurs might depend on the concentration of CaCl 2 and pA and pB in the experimental primer...|$|R

In contrast with other algae, this species showed very slow changes in the concentration of intracellular amino acids, in the Gln:Glu ratio, and, in contrast with Alrsandnum spp., only slow changes in toxin content, during such events as N-feeding of Ndeprived cells or during nutrient deprivation. This organism {{was found to be}} very susceptible to disturbance; maximum growth rates around 0. 25 – 0. 3 day− 1 with a minimum C:N mass ratio of 5. 5, were attained when cultures were only disturbed by sampling once a day. P-deprived cells were larger (twice the usual C content of 4 ng C cell− 1 and volume of 20 pl). The content of free amino acids was always low (5 % of cell-N), with low contributions made by arginine (the precursor for paralytic shellfish toxins). Cells growing using ammonium had the lowest C:N ratios and the highest proportion of intracellular amino acids as arginine. The toxin profile (<b>equal</b> <b>mole</b> ratios of dcSTX, GTX 5, dcGT 2 / 3 C 1 and C 2, and half those values for C 3 and C 4) was stable and the toxin concentration varied between 0. 2 and 1 mM STX equivalents (highest when ammonium was not limiting, lowest in P-deprived cells, though as the latter were larger toxin per cell was not so variable). Decreased salinity did not result in increases in toxin content. Significant amounts of amino acids (mainly serine and glycine, with a total often exceeding 4 μM) accumulated in the growth medium during batch growth even though the cultures were not bacteria free.

The theory states that, under the conditions of equal activities of NY and H 2 O, the average hydration numbers characterizing the ionsolvent interactions have the same values in the mixture as in the subsystems {{and the process of}} mixing these nonideal electrolyte solutions is as simple as that of mixing the ideal solutions if the contributions from the ion-ion interactions to the solvent activity are assumed to be the same in the mixture as in its subsystems, which has been justified by the calculations of the Pitzer equation.

The {{original}} submission is copyrighted by American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found here: [URL] optical, and hydrographical data were collected on the WEC 88 cruise along 150 °W and during a 6 -day time series station on the equator during February/March 1988. This area was characterized by a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM), located at 50 – 70 m depth at the equator and descending down to 120 – 125 m at the north and south end of the transect. Highest primary production rates were near-surface and confined to the equatorial region and stations between 7 ° and 11 °N. To determine the relationship between solar-stimulated fluorescence (centered at 683 nm wavelength) and primary production, a production-fluorescence model based on phytoplankton physiology and marine optics is described. Results of model calculations predict that there is a linear relation between production and fluorescence. A comparison between morning and midday measurements of the production-fluorescence relation showed that there was some difference between the two, whereas evening measurements, on the other hand, were distinctly different from the morning/midday ones. This seems to suggest that diurnal variations contribute significantly to variability in the quantum yield of photochemical processes. The ratio of the quantum yield of photosynthesis to the quantum yield of fluorescence (Φ [subscript]c /Φ[subscript]ƒ), the parameter which will determine how well production can be estimated from optical recordings, ranged between 0. 24 and 0. 44 molC Ein⁻¹ (an Einstein <b>equals</b> a <b>mole</b> of photons) for all stations. The highest value for this ratio occurred at the equatorial stations, indicating that interstation (i. e., latitudinal) variability could {{have an effect on the}} production-fluorescence relation. Measured (with ¹⁴C incubations) and predicted production compared quite well, although high measured production rates for near-surface samples were underestimated in most cases.

40|$|The {{chemical}} modification of bacterial components was studied following incubation of Escherichia coli with the peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -iodide (I−) antimicrobial system or with iodine (I 2). The oxidation of cell sulfhydryls and the iodination of cell components were measured. Both the peroxidase system and I 2 oxidized sulfhydryls. When the I− {{concentration in the}} peroxidase system was greater than 100 μM, the peroxidase system and I 2 were equivalent. That is, sulfhydryl oxidation or killing per mole of H 2 O 2 <b>equaled</b> that per <b>mole</b> of I 2. These results were consistent with peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of I− to yield 1 mol of I 2 per mol of H 2 O 2. Sulfhydryls were oxidized to yield sulfenic acids and free I−. With I− concentrations {{in the range of}} 10 to 100 μM, the amount of sulfhydryls oxidized by the peroxidase system could exceed the amount of I−. Because the oxidation of sulfhydryls to sulfenic acids did not consume I−, one I− ion could participate in the oxidation of many sulfhydryls. With I− concentrations lower than 10 μM, complete oxidation of sulfhydryls was not obtained. Incorporation of I− into iodinated derivatives of bacterial components partly depleted the system of I− and limited the formation of I 2. These results indicated that antimicrobial activity was due to peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of I− to I 2, followed by I 2 oxidation of cell components. There was a direct relationship between sulfhydryl oxidation and antimicrobial action. Although iodination of bacterial components accompanied sulfhydryl oxidation, the amount of I− incorporation was not directly related to antimicrobial action.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of antimicrobial {{activity of the}} peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -iodide (I−) system was investigated. Inhibition of respiration and loss of viability of Escherichia coli were used as measures of antimicrobial activity. Because the bacteria destroyed H 2 O 2, peroxidase antimicrobial action depended on the competition for H 2 O 2 between the bacteria and the peroxidase. Utilization of H 2 O 2 by the peroxidase was favored by (i) increasing either the peroxidase or the I− concentration, so as to increase the rate of oxidation of I−, (ii) lowering the temperature to lower the rate of destruction of H 2 O 2 by the bacteria, and (iii) adding H 2 O 2 in small increments {{so as to avoid}} a large excess of H 2 O 2 relative to I−. When utilization of H 2 O 2 by the peroxidase system was favored, the peroxidase system and iodine (I 2) were equivalent. That is, antimicrobial action per mole of H 2 O 2 <b>equaled</b> that per <b>mole</b> of I 2. Also, identical antimicrobial action was obtained either by incubating the bacteria directly with the peroxidase system or by preincubating the peroxidase system so as to form I 2 and then adding the bacteria. On the other hand, peroxidase antimicrobial action could be obtained at low I− concentrations. These I− concentrations were lower than the concentration of I 2 that was required for antimicrobial action. It is proposed that peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of I− yields I 2, which reacts with bacterial components to yield the oxidized components and I−. The I− that is released can be reoxidized and participate again in the oxidation of bacterial components. In this way, I− acts as a cofactor in the peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of bacterial components...|$|R
40|$|The {{speciation}} {{of water}} {{in a variety of}} hydrous silicate glasses, including simple and rhyolitic compositions, synthesized over a range of experimental conditions with up to 11 weight percent water has been determined using infrared spectroscopy. This technique has been calibrated with a series of standard glasses and provides a precise and accurate method for determining the concentrations of molecular water and hydroxyl groups in these glasses. For all the compositions studied, most of the water is dissolved as hydroxyl groups at total water contents less than 3 - 4 weight percent; at higher total water contents, molecular water becomes the dominant species. For total water contents above 3 - 4 weight percent, the amount of water dissolved as hydroxyl groups is approximately constant at about 2 weight percent and additional water is incorporated as molecular water. Although there are small but measurable differences in the ratio of molecular water to hydroxyl groups at a given total water content among these silicate glasses, the speciation of water is similar over this range of composition. The trends in the concentrations of the H-bearing species in the hydrous glasses included in this study are similar to those observed in other silicate glasses using either infrared or NMR spectroscopy. The effects of pressure and temperature on the speciation {{of water in}} albitic glasses have been investigated. The ratio of molecular water to hydroxyl groups at a given total water content is independent of the pressure and temperature of equilibration for albitic glasses synthesized in rapidly quenching piston cylinder apparatus at temperatures greater than 1000 °C and pressures greater than 8 kbar. For hydrous glasses quenched from melts cooled at slower rates (i. e., in internally heated or in air-quench cold seal pressure vessels), there is an increase in the ratio of molecular water to hydroxyl group content that probably reflects reequilibration of the melt to lower temperatures during slow cooling. Molecular water and hydroxyl group concentrations in glasses provide information on the dissolution mechanisms of water in silicate liquids. Several mixing models involving homogeneous equilibria of the form H_ 2 O + O = 20 H among melt species have been explored for albitic melts. These models can account for the measured species concentrations if the effects of non-ideal behavior or mixing of polymerized units are included, or by allowing for the presence of several different types of anhydrous species. A thermodynamic model for hydrous albitic melts has been developed {{based on the assumption that}} the activity of water in the melt is <b>equal</b> to the <b>mole</b> fraction of molecular water determined by infrared spectroscopy. This model can account for the position of the watersaturated solidus of crystalline albite, the pressure and temperature dependence of the solubility of water in albitic melt, and the volumes of hydrous albitic melts. To the extent that it is successful, this approach provides a direct link between measured species concentrations in hydrous albitic glasses and the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the albite-water system. The approach taken in modelling the thermodynamics of hydrous albitic melts has been generalized to other silicate compositions. Spectroscopic measurements of species concentrations in rhyolitic and simple silicate glasses quenched from melts equilibrated with water vapor provide important constraints on the thermodynamic properties of these melt-water systems. In particular, the assumption that the activity of water is <b>equal</b> to the <b>mole</b> fraction of molecular water has been tested in detail and shown to be a valid approximation for a range of hydrous silicate melts and the partial molar volume of water in these systems has been constrained. Thus, the results of this study provide a useful thermodynamic description of hydrous melts that can be readily applied to other melt-water systems for which spectroscopic measurements of the H-bearing species are available. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{a direct}} remote sensing {{approach}} from {{space for the}} determination of ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), through measurement of vegetation reflectance changes expressed with the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). The PRI is a normalized difference index based on spectral changes at a physiologically active wavelength (approximately 531 nanometers) as compared to a reference waveband, and is only available from a very few satellites. These include the two Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites each of which have a narrow (10 -nanometer) ocean band centered at 531 nanometers. We examined several PRI variations computed with candidate reference bands, since MODIS lacks the traditional 570 -nanometer reference band. The PRI computed using MODIS land band 1 (620 - 670 nanometers) gave the best performance for daily LUE estimation. Through rigorous statistical analyses over a large image collection (n equals 420), the success of relating in situ daily tower-derived LUE to MODIS observations for northern forests was strongly influenced by satellite viewing geometry. LUE was calculated from CO 2 fluxes (moles per moles of carbon absorbed quanta) measured at instrumented Canadian Carbon Program flux towers in four Canadian forests: a mature fir site in British Columbia, mature aspen and black spruce sites in Saskatchewan, and a mixed deciduous/coniferous forest site in Ontario. All aspects of the viewing geometry had significant effects on the MODIS-PRI, including the view zenith angle (VZA), the view azimuth angle, and the displacement of the view azimuth relative to the solar principal plane, in addition to illumination related variables. Nevertheless, we show that forward scatter sector views (VZA, 16 degrees- 45 degrees) provided the strongest relationships to daily LUE, especially those collected {{in the early afternoon}} by Aqua (r squared = 0. 83, RMSE (root mean square error) <b>equals</b> 0. 003 <b>moles</b> per moles of carbon absorbed quanta). Nadir (VZA, 0 degrees plus or minus 15 degrees) and backscatter views (VZA, 16 degrees to 45 degrees) had lower performance in estimating LUE (nadir: r squared approximately equal to 0. 62 - 0. 67; backscatter: r squared approximately equal to 0. 54 - 0. 59) and similar estimation error (RMSE equals 0. 004 - 0. 005). When directional effects were not considered, only a moderately successful MODIS-PRI vs. LUE relationship (r squared equals 0. 34, RMSE equals 0. 007) was obtained in the full dataset (all views & sites, both satellites), but site-specific relationships were able to discriminate between coniferous and deciduous forests. Overall, MODIS-PRI values from Terra (late morning) were higher than those from Aqua (early afternoon), before/after the onset of diurnal stress responses expressed spectrally. Therefore, we identified ninety-two Terra-Aqua "same day" pairs, for which the sum of Terra morning and Aqua afternoon MODIS-PRI values (PRI (sub sum) using all available directional observations was linearly correlated with daily tower LUE (r squared equals 0. 622, RMSE equals 0. 013) and independent of site differences or meteorological information. Our study highlights the value of off-nadir directional reflectance observations, and the value of pairing morning and afternoon satellite observations to monitor stress responses that inhibit carbon uptake in Canadian forest ecosystems. In addition, we show that MODIS-PRI values, when derived from either: (i) forward views only, or (ii) Terra/Aqua same day (any view) combined observations, provided more accurate estimates of tower-measured daily LUE than those derived from either nadir or backscatter views or those calculated by the widely used semi-operational MODIS GPP model (MOD 17) which is based on a theoretical maximum LUE and environmental data. Consequently, we demonstrate the importance of diurnal as well as off-nadir satellite observations for detecting vegetation physiological processes...|$|R
