40|$|Both {{the theory}} of {{top-down}} penetration of <b>fashion</b> consumption (Veblen - Simmel model) and {{the theory of}} bottom-up <b>fashion</b> consumption have been found consistent with the consumer behavior in the China’s <b>fashion</b> consumer market and the trend of such behavior keeps growing. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} carry out a study on <b>fashion</b> consumption {{to meet the needs of}} the development of real life and <b>fashion</b> consumption. Firstly, we describe the content of <b>fashion</b> consumption, discuss the connotation and main features of <b>fashion</b> and analyze the relationship among <b>fashion,</b> innovation, classic and prevalence; namely, innovation is the pioneer of <b>fashion</b> while the classic is the denotation of faded <b>fashion</b> and prevalence is the continuance of <b>fashion.</b> Secondly, we examine the psychological motivations and behavioral mechanisms of <b>fashion</b> consumption, pointing out that the psychological motivations of <b>fashion</b> consumption is showing-off and it is of symbolic significance. The general characteristics of <b>fashion</b> buyers and consumer characteristics including the elegant <b>fashion,</b> the popular <b>fashion,</b> the cool <b>fashion</b> and the Bobos <b>fashion</b> are presented. We put forward a decision-making process in <b>fashion</b> consumption according to the influence of <b>fashion,</b> the extent of consumer involvement and the purchase decision time. Finally, by analyzing the <b>fashion</b> consumption behavior of the Chinese consumers, we point out that the core of the cool <b>fashion</b> or the Bobo <b>fashion</b> is actually not materialism and both cool <b>fashion</b> and Bobo <b>fashion</b> will have a profound influence in the <b>fashion</b> consumption in the future...|$|R

5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes <b>fashioned</b> after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also <b>fashioned</b> from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E

30|$|Because the <b>fashion</b> {{adoption}} process evolves {{in stages}} prompted first by {{introduction of new}} styles or variations of existing styles, consumers can be segmented according to <b>fashion</b> leadership as <b>fashion</b> leaders or <b>fashion</b> followers (Workman and Freeburg 2009). Compared to <b>fashion</b> followers, <b>fashion</b> leaders are higher in <b>fashion</b> innovativeness and opinion leadership. <b>Fashion</b> leaders are comprised of three groups that affect the speed and trajectory of <b>fashion</b> adoption: <b>fashion</b> innovators (willing to adopt new <b>fashion</b> styles relatively early in the <b>fashion</b> life cycle), <b>fashion</b> opinion leaders (give advice, act as an information source, and thereby, influence others’ purchase decisions), and innovative communicators who combine both roles.|$|R
