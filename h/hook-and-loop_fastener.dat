5000|$|Due to the {{physical}} nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact. Of these versions, Touch rugby, in which [...] "tackles" [...] are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults. Tag Rugby, is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fastener</b> tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies {{in the fact that}} kicking the ball is not allowed.|$|E
50|$|With {{the modern}} {{development}} of synthetic shipping boots made with <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> most people choose this option {{as they are}} quicker to apply.

50|$|Although the tensile {{strength}} {{is similar to}} Kevlar, Vectran still tends to experience tensile fractures when exposed to significant stress. The wispy, hair-like fibers tend to fray, to easily acquire dirt, and to readily entangle in <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> from which they must sometimes then be cut or (when possible) torn.If used without protective coatings, Vectran has low resistance to UV degradation.|$|R
50|$|Because its ease of use, <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{have been}} used {{for a wide variety of}} {{applications}} where a temporary bond is required. It is especially popular in clothing where it replaces buttons or zippers, and as a shoe fastener for children who have not yet learned to tie shoelaces. Touch fasteners are used in adaptive clothing, which is designed for people with physical disabilities, the elderly, and the infirm, who may experience difficulty dressing themselves due to an inability to manipulate closures such as buttons and zippers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fastener</b> {{was conceived}} in 1941 by Swiss engineer George de Mestral. The idea {{came to him}} one day after returning from a hunting trip with his dog in the Alps. He took {{a close look at}} the burrs (seeds) of burdock that kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur. He examined them under a microscope, and noted their hundreds of [...] "hooks" [...] that caught on anything with a loop, such as clothing, animal fur, or hair. He saw the possibility of binding two materials reversibly in a simple fashion if he could figure out how to duplicate the hooks and loops. Hook and Loop is viewed by some like Steven Vogel or Werner Nachtigall as a key example of inspiration from nature or the copying of nature's mechanisms (called bionics or biomimesis).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hook-and-loop</b> <b>{{fasteners}},</b> hook-and-pile fasteners or touch fasteners, {{commonly known}} as [...] "velcro", consist of two components: typically, two lineal fabric strips (or, alternatively, round [...] "dots" [...] or squares) which are attached (sewn or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks; the second features even smaller and [...] "hairier" [...] loops. When the two components are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily {{during the time that}} they are pressed together. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive [...] "ripping" [...] sound.|$|R

If a trademark {{is associated with a}} new invention, the trademark owner may also consider developing a generic term for the product to be used in descriptive contexts, to avoid inappropriate use of the [...] "house" [...] mark. [...] Such a term is called a generic descriptor, and is frequently used immediately after the trademark to provide a description of the product or service. [...] For example, [...] "Kleenex tissues" [...] ("facial tissues" [...] being the generic descriptor) or [...] "Velcro brand fasteners" [...] for Velcro brand name <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{was born}} in Clearwater, Florida on Dec 7, 1984. Her father, Paul Phillips, is a {{cardiologist}} and her mother, Liz Phillips, worked as a nurse.Phillips attended Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida. It was during this time that Lindsay developed the concept for sandals that would eventually lead her to launch SwitchFlops - interchangeable flip-flops with removable straps to match any outfit. Encouraged by the favorable responses she received after creating ceramic flips flops - part of an art class project - she began expanding her vision by toying {{with the idea of}} creating colorful straps and buttons that could diversify the look of just one pair of flip flops. She soon realized that by using <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> her vision of “Change Your Look, Not Your Sole” was complete. By the end of her high school career, Phillips applied for a patent.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{idea of a}} {{possible}} control of metal ion properties by constraining the coordination sphere geometry was introduced by Vallee and Williams {{with the concept of}} entasis, which is frequently postulated to be at stake in metallo-biomolecules. However, the interactions controlling the geometry at metal centers remain often elusive. In this study, the coordination properties towards copper ions -CuII or CuI- of a geometrically constrained glycoligand centered on a sugar-scaffold were compared with those of an analogous ligand built on an unconstrained alkyl chain. The sugar-centered ligand was shown to be more preorganized for CuII-coordination than its open-chain analogue, with an unusual additional stabilization of the CuI redox state. This preference for CuI was suggested to arise from geometric constraints favoring an optimized folding of the glycoligand minimizing steric repulsions. In other words, the CuI d 10 species is stabilized by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR). This idea was rationalized by a theoretical non-covalent interactions (NCI) analysis. The cumulative effects of weak forces were shown to create an efficient buckle as in a <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fastener</b> and fine structural features within the glycoligand reduce repulsive interactions for the CuI state. This study emphasizes that mono-saccharide platforms are appropriate ligand backbones for a delicate geometric control at the metal center, with a network of weak interactions within the ligand. This structuration availing in glycoligands makes them attractive for metallic entasis...|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon how}} form-fitting the boot is, {{to allow a}} rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft may be {{designed}} to open lengthwise. If so, Velcro or other <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> are typically used on the inner sides of the opening to allow the rider to close the boot over the foot, ankle and leg. This allows for some flexibility for the rider to control the boot's tightness. Some manufacturers also include an internal quick-lacing system between a soft inner leg and the harder outer shell of the boot shaft to further ensure a tight, but comfortable fit. The heel of a racing boot is typically very low: not more than 1/2-inch (13 mm), and sole of the heel and foot is typically rather smooth. A curved plastic or composite plate may be included to cover the shin of the boot to protect the rider's shin.|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{invented a}} drape-like shield against {{scattered}} X-rays that can safely {{come into contact}} with medical equipment or people during fluoroscopically guided procedures. The shield can be easily removed from a C-arm unit using one hand. We evaluated the use of the novel removable shield during the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. Methods We measured the dose rate of scattered X-rays around endoscopists with and without this removable shield and surveyed the occupational doses to the ERCP staff. We also examined the endurance of the shield. Results The removable shield reduced the dose rate of scattered X-rays to one-tenth and reduced the monthly dose to an endoscopist by at least two-fifths. For 2. 5 years, there was no damage to the shield and no loosening of the seam. The bonding of the <b>hook-and-loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> did not weaken, although the powerful double-sided tapes made especially for plastic did. Conclusions The removable shield can reduce radiation exposure to the ERCP staff and may contribute to reducing the exposure to the eye lenses of operators. It would also be possible to expand its use to other fluoroscopically guided procedures besides ERCP because it is a light, simple, and useful device. Key Points • We invented a shield that can be removed from C-arm units with one hand. • The removable shield reduces the dose rate of X-rays to one-tenth. • The removable shield reduces operator exposure by two-fifths. • The removable shield is durable, lasting for several years. • The drape-like removable shield is light, simple, and useful. © 2014 European Society of Radiology...|$|R
5000|$|An anti-suicide smock, Ferguson, turtle suit, Bam Bam suit, or suicide gown is a {{tear-resistant}} single-piece {{outer garment}} that is generally {{used to prevent}} a hospitalized, incarcerated, or otherwise detained individual from forming a noose with the garment to commit suicide.
