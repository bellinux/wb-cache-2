5000|$|In aerosol physics, {{deposition}} is {{the process}} by which aerosol particles collect or deposit themselves on solid surfaces, decreasing the concentration of the particles in the air. It can be divided into two sub-processes: dry and wet deposition. The rate of deposition, or the <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity,</b> is slowest for particles of an intermediate size. Mechanisms for deposition are most effective for either very small or very large particles. Very large particles will settle out quickly through sedimentation (settling) or impaction processes, while Brownian diffusion has the greatest influence on small particles. [...] This is because very small particles coagulate in few hours until they achieve a diameter of 0.3 micrometres. At this size they no longer coagulate. This has a great influence in the amount of PM-2.5 present in the air.|$|E

A comparison between modeled dry fluxes (the indirect method) and measured dry fluxes (the direct method) showed that modeled dry fluxes were slightly higher for marine and crustal elements while measured dry fluxes were higher for the pollution elements. Comparisons of measured dry and wet deposition fluxes for various elements in Hong Kong indicated that dry and wet removal processes were of similar significance for crustal and marine elements.

40|$|Overall dry <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> {{of several}} {{elements}} {{were determined by}} dividing measured fluxes by measured airborne concentrations in different particle size ranges. The dry deposition measurements were made with a smooth surrogate surface on an automated dry deposition sampler (Eagle II) and the ambient particle concentrations were measured with a dichotomous sampler. These long-term measurements were made in Chicago, IL, South Haven, MI, and Sleeping Bear Dunes, MI, from December 1993 through October 1995 {{as part of the}} Lake Michigan Mass Balance Study. In general, the dry deposition fluxes of elements were highly correlated with coarse particle concentrations, slightly less well correlated with total particle concentrations, and least well correlated with fine particle concentrations. The calculated overall dry <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> obtained using coarse particle concentrations varied from approximately 12 cm s− 1 for Mg in Chicago to 0. 2 cm s− 1 for some primarily anthropogenic metals at the more remote sites.

40|$|The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has {{recently}} questioned the appropriate value for tritium <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> {{used in the}} MELCOR Accident Consequence Code System Ver. 2 (Chanin and Young 1998) code when estimating bounding dose (95 th percentile) for safety analysis (DNFSB 2011). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide appropriate, defensible values of the tritium <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> for use in Savannah River Site (SRS) safety analyses. To accomplish this, consideration must be given to the re-emission of tritium after deposition. Approximately 85 % of the surface area of the SRS is forested. The majority of the forests are pine plantations, 68 %. The remaining forest area is 6 % mixed pine and hardwood and 26 % swamp hardwood. Most of the path from potential release points to the site boundary is through forested land. A search of published studies indicate daylight, tritiated water (HTO) vapor deposition velocities in forest vegetation can range from 0. 07 to 2. 8 cm/s. Analysis of the results of studies done on an SRS pine plantation and climatological data from the SRS meteorological network indicate that the average <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> during daylight periods is around 0. 42 cm/s. The minimum <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> was determined to be about 0. 1 cm/s, which is the recommended bounding value. <b>Deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> and residence time (half-life) of HTO in vegetation are related by the leaf area and leaf water volume in the forest. For the characteristics of the pine plantation at SRS the residence time corresponding to the average, daylight <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> is 0. 4 hours. The residence time corresponding to the night-time <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> of 0. 1 cm/s is around 2 hours. A simple dispersion model which accounts for deposition and re-emission of HTO vapor was used to evaluate the impact on exposure to the maximally exposed offsite individual (MOI) at the SRS boundary (Viner 2012). Under conditions that produce the bounding, 95 th percentile MOI exposure, i. e., low wind speed, weak turbulence, night, low <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity,</b> the effect of deposition and re-emission on MOI exposure was found to be very small. The exposure over the two hour period following arrival of the plume was found to be decreased by less than 0. 05 %. Furthermore the sensitivity to <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> was low. Increasing <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> to 0. 5 cm/s reduced exposure to 0. 3 %. After a 24 hour period, an MOI would have been exposed to all of the released material. Based on the low sensitivity of MOI exposure to the value of <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> when re-emission is considered, it is appropriately conservative to use a 0. 0 cm/s effective <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> for safety analysis in the MACCS 2 code...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterization}} {{scheme for}} calculating gaseous dry <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> in air-quality models is revised based on recent study results on non-stomatal uptake of O 3 and SO 2 over 5 different vegetation types. Non-stomatal resistance, which includes in-canopy aerodynamic, soil and cuticle resistances, for SO 2 and O 3 is parameterized {{as a function}} of friction velocity, relative humidity, leaf area index, and canopy wetness. Non-stomatal resistance for other chemical species is scaled to those of SO 2 and O 3 based on their chemical and physical characteristics. Stomatal resistance is calculated using a two-big-leaf stomatal resistance sub-model for all gaseous species of interest. The improvements in the present model compared to its earlier version include a newly developed non-stomatal resistance formulation, a realistic treatment of cuticle and ground resistance in winter, and the handling of seasonally-dependent input parameters. Model evaluation shows that the revised parameterization can provide more realistic <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> for both O 3 and SO 2, especially for wet canopies. Example model output shows that the parameterization provides reasonable estimates of dry <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> for different gaseous species, land types and diurnal and seasonal variations.

MLM utilizes a resistance analogy to calculate <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> appropriate for whole vegetative canopies, while employing a multilayer integration to account for vertically varying meteorology, canopy morphology and radiative transfer within the canopy. However, the MLM formulation, as it was originally presented and as it has been subsequently employed, contains a non-physical representation related to the leaf-level quasi-laminar boundary layer resistance that affects the calculation of the total canopy resistance. In this note, the non-physical representation of the canopy resistance as originally formulated in MLM is discussed and a revised, physically consistent, formulation is suggested as a replacement. The revised canopy resistance formulation reduces estimates of HNO 3 <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> by as much as 38 % during mid-day as compared to values generated by the original formulation.

The <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities,</b> Vd, are often parameterised in air quality and climate modelling as function of the friction velocity, u*, atmospheric stability, and particle size (if size-segregated information is available). In this work, {{a study of the}} correlation between Vd and u* over different surfaces is presented for both PM 2. 5 and particle number fluxes. Results indicate an almost linear increase of Vd with u* with slopes similar for PM 2. 5 fluxes and particle number fluxes over the different surfaces analysed. This means that the ratios Vd/u* tend to collapse over similar values even if Vd and u* are significantly different because u* take into account most of the surface effects. There is a limited difference between stable cases and unstable/neutral cases with slightly lower <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> in stable cases for fixed values of u*. The average value of Vd/u* is 0. 010 ± 0. 0017 (median 0. 0062 ± 0. 0015) (considering all stabilities) and 0. 0097 ± 0. 002 (median 0. 005 ± 0. 001) for stable cases.

Plugging can lead to frequent shutdowns, equipment damage and even explosions. <b>Deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> determination is one of the design philosophies that can be employed to evaluate plugging potential. <b>Deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> is the velocity below which particles begin to deposit forming moving or stationary beds {{at the bottom of the}} pipe (Poloski et al. 2009 a, b; Yokuda et al. 2009; Turian et al. 1987; Peysson 2004; Doron and Barnea 1996; Ibarra et al. 2014). This causes the flow to become unstable, and the pipe will eventually clog. Partial pipeline blockages may lead to erosion, corrosion and local velocity increase (Najmi et al. 2015). Plugging results from transporting slurries at velocities lower than the <b>deposition</b> <b>velocity</b> (Ibarra et al. 2014; Najmi et al. 2015; Salama 2000; King et al. 2001; McLaury et al. 2011; Al-lababidi et al. 2012).

The data suggest that dry deposition is the dominant daytime sink for small, saturated oxygenates. Greater than 6 wt %C emitted as isoprene by the forest was returned by dry deposition of its oxidized products. Peroxides account for a large fraction of the oxidant flux, possibly eclipsing ozone in more pristine regions. The measured organic nitrates comprise a sizable portion (15 %) of the oxidized nitrogen input into the canopy, with HNO 3 making up the balance. We observe that water-soluble compounds (e. g., strong acids and hydroperoxides) deposit with low surface resistance whereas compounds with moderate solubility (e. g., organic nitrates and hydroxycarbonyls) or poor solubility (e. g., HCN) exhibited reduced uptake at the surface of plants.

We show that V d of COS is generally significantly larger than that of CO 2. We therefore introduced this attribute into a new global estimate of COS fluxes into vegetation. The global COS uptake by vegetation as estimated by the new model ranges between 0. 69 - 1. 40 Tg a - 1, based on the Net Primary Productivity (NPP). Taking into account Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) the deposition estimate ranges between 1. 37 - 2. 81 Tg a - 1 (0. 73 - 1. 50 Tg S a - 1). We believe {{that in order to}} obtain accurate and reliable global NPP-based estimates for the COS flux into vegetation, the different <b>deposition</b> <b>velocities</b> of COS and CO 2 must be taken into account...|$|R
