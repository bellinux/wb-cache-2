The <b>disease</b> <b>labels</b> are not used in the modelling stage. However, we hypothesize that if the variation in the data is related to a disease state, the latent variables will reflect this. After model fitting, we therefore associate each individual’s estimated latent variable score with his or her disease status.|$|R
40|$|Menopause, once {{regarded}} {{as a sign of}} sin, and later neurosis, was redefined as a deficiency disease by physicians in the 1960 s, when synthetic estrogen became widely available. Estrogen therapy, promoted by physicians and the pharmaceutical industry as a way of avoiding menopause and preserving youth and beauty, was linked to cancer and other health problems in the mid- 1970 s. Feminists argued that menopause was a normal aging process and that women's health care was a social problem. This paper looks at how these opposing definitions of menopause evolved and examines the efforts of women to fight off the stigma of the <b>disease</b> <b>label.</b> In the 1960 s the medical profession in the United States hailed the contraceptive pill as the "great liberator " of women, and estrogens in general as the fountain of youth and beauty. Prom-inent gynecologists "discovered " that menopause was a "deficiency disease, " but promised women that estrogen replacement therapy would let them avoid menopause completely and keep them "feminine forever. " Yet within a few years, U. S. feminists in the vanguard of an organized women's health movement defined the health care system, including estrogen treatment, as a seri-ous social problem.

40|$|Background: Cerebral malaria (CM) is a {{neurological}} syndrome that includes coma and seizures following malaria parasite infection. The pathophysiology {{is not fully}} understood and cannot {{be accounted for by}} infection alone: patients still succumb to CM, even if the underlying parasite infection has resolved. To that effect, there is no known adjuvant therapy for CM. Current murine CM (MCM) models do not allow for rapid clinical identification of affected animals following infection. An animal model that more closely mimics the clinical features of human CM would be helpful in elucidating potential mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and evaluating new adjuvant therapies. Methodology/Principal Findings: A quantitative, rapid murine coma and behavior scale (RMCBS) comprised of 10 parameters was developed to assess MCM manifested in C 57 BL/ 6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). Using this method a single mouse can be completely assessed within 3 minutes. The RMCBS enables the operator to follow the evolution of the clinical syndrome, validated here by correlations with intracerebral hemorrhages. It provides a tool by which subjects can be identified as symptomatic prior to the initiation of trial treatment. Conclusions/Significance: Since the RMCBS enables an operator to rapidly follow the course of <b>disease,</b> <b>label</b> a subject as affected or not, and correlate the level of illness with neuropathologic injury, it can ultimately be used to guide the initiatio...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{present study}} {{examined}} whether medical terminology impacts self-triage decisions (deciding {{if and when}} to seek medical treatment) compared to lay terminology. MethodsUndergraduate psychology student participants read 32 hypothetical health scenarios and reported how urgently they would seek care [“In this situation, when would you seek medical attention?” presented along with a seven-point scale, with anchors at either extreme: “Never (At the next scheduled appointment, if at all) ” and “As soon as possible (Within the hour),” reflecting the options coded as 1 and 7, respectively]. Data were collected in person via a paper-based questionnaire. Scenarios included a description of symptoms, which were labeled as consistent with a particular medical disorder using either a lay <b>disease</b> <b>label</b> (e. g. “Heart Attack”) or medical terminology (e. g. “Myocardial Infarction”). The 32 health scenarios represented medical disorders that purposefully reflected a spectrum of severity, commonality, and how recently the medical terminology had entered common use. ResultsFor disorders for which medical terminology has been more recently established, participants reported that they would seek care more urgently when the disorder was presented using a medical label [mean (SE) [*]=[*] 4. 08 (0. 23) ] than when they were described using the lay disease labels [3. 32 (0. 23), t(35) [*]=[*] 5. 36, p[*]<[*] 0. 001, e. g., “seborrheic dermatitis” versus “chronic dandruff”]. However, this differential response to medical or lay disease labels was not observed for disorders for which medical terminology has been more well established [medical labels[*]=[*] 5. 16 (0. 18); lay labels[*]=[*] 4. 89 (0. 18), t(35) [*]=[*]− 1. 67, p[*]=[*] 0. 104, e. g., “heart attack” and “myocardial infarction”].

40|$|With {{the latest}} {{developments}} in database technologies, it becomes easier to store the medical records of hospital patients from their first day of admission than was previously possible. In Intensive Care Units (ICU) in the modern medical information system can record patient events in relational databases every second. Knowledge mining from these huge volumes of medical data is beneficial to both caregivers and patients. Given a set of electronic patient records, a system that effectively assigns the <b>disease</b> <b>labels</b> can facilitate medical database management and also benefit other researchers, e. g. pathologists. In this paper, we have proposed a framework to achieve that goal. Medical chart and note data of a patient are used to extract distinctive features. To encode patient features, we apply a Bag-of-Words encoding method for both chart and note data. We also propose a model that takes into account both global information and local correlations between diseases. Correlated diseases are characterized by a graph structure that is embedded in our sparsity-based framework. Our algorithm captures the <b>disease</b> relevance when <b>labeling</b> <b>disease</b> codes rather than making individual decision with respect to a specific disease. At the same time, the global optimal values are guaranteed by our proposed convex objective function. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a real-world large-scale ICU database.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patient {{expectations}} {{are among the}} strongest predictors of clinicians' antibiotic prescribing decisions. Although public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics contribute to these expectations, {{little is known about}} these public views. AIM: To gain insight into public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics and respiratory tract infections. DESIGN OF STUDY: Cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire study. SETTING: Members of the general public aged 16 years and over in the Netherlands. METHODS: Public knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of antibiotics and respiratory tract infections, as well as predictors of accurate knowledge of antibiotic effectiveness, were measured using 20 questions with sub-items. The questionnaire was given to a Dutch community-based nationwide internet panel of 15 673 individuals. Of these, 1248 eligible responders were invited to participate; 935 responders (75 %) completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the participants, 44. 6 % accurately identified antibiotics as being effective against bacteria and not viruses. Acute bronchitis was considered to require treatment with antibiotics by nearly 60 % of responders. The perceived need for antibiotics for respiratory tract infection-related symptoms ranged from 6. 5 % for cough with transparent phlegm, to 46. 2 % for a cough lasting for more than 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Public misconceptions on the effectiveness of, and indications for, antibiotics exist. Nearly half of all responders (47. 8 %) incorrectly identified antibiotics as being effective in treating viral infections. Doctors should be aware that unnecessary prescribing could facilitate misconceptions regarding antibiotics and respiratory tract infections. Expectations of receiving antibiotics were higher for the <b>disease</b> <b>label</b> 'acute bronchitis' than for any of the separate or combined symptoms prominently present in respiratory tract infection. Public beliefs and expectations should be taken into account when developing interventions targeting the public, patients, and physicians to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections...|$|E

Not all correspondence will be acknowledged. THE LANGUAGE OF HEALTH CARE The alienating language of health care I think Cayton has missed his target with this editorial. 1 The key aim of medical practice is for doctors and patients to work together. To present medical practice as being either doctor or patient centred is a false dichotomy, and creates an unnecessary division. 2, 3 All specific human activities, from medicine to patient representation, generate their own specific, in-group vocabulary. For me the main issue is not the group specific vocabulary but the difference between descriptive and evaluative uses of language. In medical practice, and NHS management, we need descriptive terms for the events we see. So the term ‘frequent flyer ’ can be useful shorthand for describing, ‘a 79 -year-old woman with multiple pathologies, poor social circumstances, and a propensity to suffer exacerbations of one or other of her many illnesses. ’ It is not a judgement against the lady, who will be treated properly by staff. In medical practice we have to use labels. The process of diagnosis is one of knowing when one is justified in attaching a <b>disease</b> <b>label</b> to a patient. The art of medicine often consists of knowing when this is, and is not, appropriate. Most medical terms are descriptive. Some are evaluative, and we need to be very careful when we choose to use these terms. As doctors we mainly use language for description, so that we can communicate effectively as we care for patients. Mr Cayton may be surprised when he appreciates how much most NHS staff do care about, and connect with, the patients, whether because of, or despite, the language we use.

In a recent international competition the system was ranked first in discriminating orientation and body regions in x-ray images. In addition to organ-level discrimination, we show an application to pathology-level categorization of chest x-ray data, the most popular examination in radiology.

40|$|Stigmatization is {{characterized}} by chronic social and physical avoidance of a person(s) by other people. Infectious disease may produce an apparently similar form of isolation-disease avoidance-but on symptom remission this often abates. We propose that many forms of stigmatization reflect the activation of this disease-avoidance system, which is prone to respond to visible signs and <b>labels</b> that connote <b>disease,</b> irrespective of their accuracy. A model of this system is presented, which includes an emotional component, whereby visible disease cues directly activate disgust and contamination, motivating avoidance, and a cognitive component, whereby <b>disease</b> <b>labels</b> bring to mind disease cues, indirectly activating disgust and contamination. The unique predictions of this model are then examined, notably {{that people who are}} stigmatized evoke disgust and are contaminating. That animals too show avoidance of diseased conspecifics, and that disease-related stigma targets are avoided in most cultures, also supports this evolutionary account. The more general implications of this approach are then examined, notably how {{it can be used to}} good (e. g. improving hygiene) or bad (e. g. racial vilification) ends, by yoking particular labels with cues that connote disease and disgust. This broadening of the model allows for stigmatization of groups with little apparent connection to disease. 20 page(s...|$|R

This method, which utilizes [14 C]formaldehyde and sodium borohydride, labels all the proteins of purified Newcastle <b>disease</b> virus.

5000|$|There are {{two forms}} of the disease, a {{heritable}} form and non-heritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, {{but this does not}} imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 55% of children with retinoblastoma have the non-heritable form. If there is no history of the disease within the family, the <b>disease</b> is <b>labeled</b> [...] "sporadic", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the non-heritable form. Bilateral retinoblastomas are commonly heritable, while unilateral retinoblastomas are commonly non-heritable.|$|R
