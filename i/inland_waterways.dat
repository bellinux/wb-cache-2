5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for <b>inland</b> <b>waterways,</b> took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E
40|$|According to the Ministry of Transport {{inland water}} {{transport}} {{is one of the}} five modes of transport in our country play a very important role. <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport not only {{plays a major role in}} transporting large volumes of goods and passengers but also creates millions of jobs contributing to ensuring social security and national defense and security. However there are still many inadequacies in waterway transportation such as unequal waterway traffic The phenomenon of exploitation of river resources as planned or Process technology is not as planned exploitation of sand gravel etc. are common in most rivers and canals in the country. The signaling system is not synchronized between the signal of the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> management unit and the signal of the owner The handling of domestic goods transportation and inland port management is inadequate The force of the means of development is fast uneven but concentrated in some urban areas and industrial parks.

40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> {{transport}} represent {{environmentally friendly}} transport mode accompanied with other potential benefits, such as increased transport safety and increased cost savings. In order to encourage {{further development of}} <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in this paper focus is set on {{the identification of the}} barriers that limit and prevent development of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport. More specifically, emphasis is placed on the barriers that are preventing the cargo shifting from land to waterway transport system. Research conducted in case of Republic of Serbia investigates several barriers which are classified in four main categories: goods, logistics, infrastructure, framework conditions. Framework conditions barriers are further subdivided and classified in four subcategories: political/legal, environment, economy, technology. Results indicate that the most significant negative influence on the further development of the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in Serbia comes from the political/legal barriers. This result implies that the government need {{to pay more attention to}} development of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport, as well as to make more effort to enhance the cooperation with stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} transport costs of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport. By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport, while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport...|$|R

5|$|Interest in {{maintaining}} the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed, with the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for {{the revival of the}} Thames and Severn Canal, which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.|$|E
40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of transport operations for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that {{the effect on the}} modal split is limited. Under the most extreme climate scenario, <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport would lose about 5. 4 % of the quantity that is currently being transported annually in the part of the European <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport market considered.

The Wey and Arun Canal technically ended at Newbridge, but the restoration will include the Arun Navigation section down to Pallingham to reach the River Arun. For many years, the Solent and Arun Branch of the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association organised an annual cruise on the river to ensure that the navigation rights were maintained. Responsibility for its organisation has now been passed to the Wey and Arun Canal Trust.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase <b>inland</b> <b>waterways.</b> By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E

Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display.

5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although it is still possible to identify remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E

In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes.

Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal. The <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E

5|$|Local {{interest}} in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation {{began to develop}} in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their energies to the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily silted. Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage along Well Creek was very difficult. The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning {{for it to be}} dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the <b>Inland</b> <b>Waterways</b> Association.|$|E

40|$|Future climate {{conditions}} {{are likely to}} affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in Europe. According to some climate scenarios, in summer, in the river Rhine, periods with low water levels are likely to occur more often and become more serious. Then <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport carriers will experience more severe restrictions on the load factor of their inland ships, which implies a stronger reduction in transport capacity in the market. Transport prices will rise under such conditions. Some studies reviewed in this paper find that at extremely low water levels, the price per tonne for <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in the river Rhine area will almost double. These increased transport prices result in welfare losses. For the dry summer in 2003, the losses for North West Europe are estimated to sum up to around € 480 million. Increased transport prices trigger adaptation. <b>Inland</b> <b>waterway</b> carriers may use smaller vessels, and shippers {{have the opportunity to}} shift from <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport to alternative transport modes in periods with low water levels. This effect is probably rather modest, however, with a modal shift to road and rail smaller than 10 %. Also, changes in transport costs may lead to relocation of certain economic activities in the long run. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|The <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> {{transportation}} {{system of the}} United States (U. S.) handles 11. 7 billion tons of freight annually and connects the heartland of the U.

This dissertation aims to create decision support tools for maritime stakeholders to measure the economic impacts of the <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> {{transportation system}}s under real world scenarios including disruptions, demand changes, port expansion decisions, and channel deepening investments. Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and multiregional input-output modeling techniques are utilized to analyze the complex relationships between <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transportation system components and regional economic impact factors. The first research contribution illustrates that the expected duration of a disruption determines whether decision makers are better off waiting for the waterway system to reopen or switching to an alternative mode of transportation. Moreover, total disruption cost can be reduced by increasing estimation accuracy of disruption duration. The second research contribution shows that without future investment in <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> infrastructure, a sustainable system and associate economic impacts cannot be generated in the long-term. The third research contribution illustrates that investing in bottleneck system components results in higher economic impact than investing in non-bottleneck components.
