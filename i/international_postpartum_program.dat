40|$|The {{reduction}} of maternal mortality is a long-time international objective. One often underemphasized component of addressing complex and context-driven health problems, such as maternal mortality, {{is the importance}} of program evaluation. Program evaluation has been identified as particularly scarce among safe motherhood initiatives, which seek to reduce maternal deaths and improve the health outcomes of mothers (Freedman et al., 2007). Useful program evaluation starts with process evaluation. This study is a case study process evaluation of postpartum data collection, which utilizes interviews, observations, and document review. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate, describe, and compare the intended and actual data collection processes of Midwives for Haiti’s <b>postpartum</b> <b>program</b> at Hospital Saint Therese (HST). This process evaluation included the identification of barriers and facilitators of data collection. Some consistent intentions for data use were identified despite limited planning for data collection and evaluation prior to implementation. These intentions include monitoring outputs, connecting identified complications to interventions used, and improving the quality of care provided. The next step to improving postpartum data collection at HST is to develop a clear program logic model and evaluation plan, which should include short-term and mid-term objectives to effectively address their long-term objective of reducing maternal mortality. The utilization of near-miss cases as proxy for maternal mortality may enable Midwives for Haiti to better understand postpartum outcomes and the impact of the <b>postpartum</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} risks and {{benefits}} of an Early <b>Postpartum</b> Discharge <b>Program</b> vs standard <b>postpartum</b> care. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. 637 -bed university-affiliated urban hospital. Participants. 175 healthy women recruited at 32 - 38 wks from MD and hospital ultrasound offices. Interventions. Early Postpartum Discharge Program: discharge 6 - 36 hours postpartum and nursing care by telephone and/or at home at 34 - 38 weeks gestation, $ leq$ 48 hours postpartum and 3, 5, and 10 days postpartum. Control. Postpartum stay of 48 - 72 hours and follow-up as determined by the woman's physician. Measurement/Results. At 1 month follow-up, no significant differences were seen overall in an established scale of perceived maternal competence (experimental-control = 4. 3 points (95 % confidence interval $-$ 7. 7, 16. 3)); infant weight gain (1. 2 g/day ($-$ 2. 8, 5. 2)); identification of significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (rate ratio 0. 50 (0. 10, 2. 51)); infant utilization of health services (rate ratio 0. 88 (0. 45, 1. 73)); or predominant breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio 1. 25 (0. 88, 1. 75)). Early <b>Postpartum</b> Discharge <b>Program</b> participants, however, had significantly less frequent infant bilirubin testing (rate ratio 0. 39 (0. 17, 0. 94)). The Early <b>Postpartum</b> Discharge <b>Program</b> also enhanced maternal competence in recent immigrants (26. 9 points (2. 7, 51. 5)). Conclusion.

40|$|The {{implications}} of shortened postpar-tum hospital stay for maternal and infant health {{as well as}} for community-based care have received considerable attention over the past two decades. In the 1980 s, litera-ture on early postpartum discharge, often defined as discharge within 48 hours of birth, emphasized the need for careful screening and adequate follow-up after dis-charge. 1 - 3 By 1998, a postpartum length of stay of 48 hours or less following vaginal delivery had become common practice in Ontario, yet there was lack of standardized <b>postpartum</b> <b>programs</b> in various regions. 4 A concern raised in recent publications is that there has been an increase in neona-tal hospital readmission rates associated with shortened length of stay. Lock and Ray 5 reported that rates rose from 6. 7 % to 11. 7 % following the implementation of an early discharge program that reduced the mean length of stay to 1. 62 days at one Ontario hospital.

40|$|Background. Low-income {{minority}} {{women with}} prior gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM) or high BMIs have {{increased risk for}} chronic illnesses postpartum. Although the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) provides an evidence-based model for reducing diabetes risk, few community-based interventions have adapted this program for pGDM women. Methods. STAR MAMA is an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating a hybrid HIT/Health Coaching DPP-based 20 -week <b>postpartum</b> <b>program</b> for diabetes prevention compared with education from written materials at baseline. Eligibility includes women 18 – 39 years old, ≥ 32 weeks pregnant, and GDM or BMI > 25. Clinic- and community-based recruitment in San Francisco and Sonoma Counties targets 180 women. Sociodemographic and health coaching data from a preliminary sample are presented. Results. Most of the 86 women included to date (88 %) have GDM, 80 % were identified as Hispanic/Latina, 78 % have migrant status, and most are Spanish-speaking. Women receiving the intervention indicate high engagement, with 86 % answering 1 + calls. Health coaching callbacks last an average of 9 minutes with range of topics discussed. Case studies presented convey a range of emotional, instrumental, and health literacy-related supports offered by health coaches. Discussion.

This study aimed to provide postpartum home care for mothers to assess its effects on mothers' health in Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in two phases. First, a comprehensive <b>postpartum</b> home care <b>program</b> was compiled by performing a comparative study, using the available guidelines in this regard in different countries and based on the opinions of the experts. Next, a clinical trial was carried out on 276 women who gave birth in the university hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.

We assessed beliefs of Oklahoma American Indian women about preventing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease after having gestational diabetes. We also assessed barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle changes postpartum and intervention approaches that facilitate participation in a <b>postpartum</b> lifestyle <b>program.</b> MethodsIn partnership with a tribal health system, we conducted a mixed-method study with American Indian women aged 19 to 45 years who had prior gestational diabetes, using questionnaires, focus groups, and individual interviews. Questionnaires were used to identify women 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s cardiometabolic risk perceptions and feasibility and acceptability of Internet or mobile phone technology for delivery of a <b>postpartum</b> lifestyle modification <b>program.</b> Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted to identify key perspectives and preferences related to a potential program. ResultsParticipants were 26 women, all of whom completed surveys; 11 women participated in focus group sessions, and 15 participated in individual interviews. Most women believed they would inevitably develop diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or both; however, they were optimistic that they could delay onset with lifestyle change.

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiven ess of a <b>postpartum</b> exercise <b>program</b> on health -related {{quality of life and}} psychological well-being. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Tokyo, Japan. The intervention groups participated in ball-exercise classes (week ly exercise of 90 minutes for four weeks) at three months postpartum. The exercise class included the following: 1) greeting and warm-up; 2) aerobic exercise involving bouncing on an exercise ball 55 or 65 cm in diameter; 3) rest and self-introduction; 4) stretching and cooling down. The primary outcome measure was health-relate d Quality of Life (QOL) assessed using the MOS Short-Form 36 -Item Health Survey (SF- 36 v 2). The secondary outcome measures were Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores. The intervention group was compared to the control group at four months postpartum. Results: Of the 120 women screened, 110 women met the study criteria. Nine could not be included and the remaining 101 were allocated randomly into intervention and control groups (50 and 51 participants respectively). Analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline values indicated that the SF 36 subscales of physical functioning (p = 0. 018) and vitality (p = 0. 016) significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group, although {{there were no significant differences}} between the groups in the SF 36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores.

40|$|Abstract Background Governments often create {{policies}} {{that rely on}} implementation by arms length organizations and require practice changes {{on the part of}} different segments {{of the health care system}} without understanding the differences in and complexities of these agencies. In 2000, in response to publicity about the shortening length of postpartum hospital stay, the Ontario government created a universal program offering up to a 60 -hour postpartum stay and a public health follow-up to mothers and newborn infants. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a health policy initiative was implemented in two different parts of a health care system and to analyze the barriers and facilitators to achieving practice change. Methods The data reported came from two studies of postpartum health and service use in Ontario Canada. Data were collected from newly delivered mothers who had uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. The study samples were drawn from the same five purposefully selected hospitals for both studies. Questionnaires prior to discharge and structured telephone interviews at 4 -weeks post discharge were used to collect data before and after policy implementation. Qualitative data were collected using focus groups with hospital and community-based health care practitioners and administrators at each site. Results In both studies, the respondents reflected a population of women who experienced an "average" or non-eventful hospital-based, singleton vaginal delivery. The findings of the second study demonstrated wide variance in implementation of the offer of a 60 -hour stay among the sites and focus groups revealed that none of the hospitals acknowledged the 60 -hour stay as an official policy. The uptake of the offer of a 60 -hour stay was unrelated to the rate of offer. The percentage of women with a hospital stay of less than 25 hours and the number with the guideline that the call be within 48 hours of hospital discharge. Public health telephone contact was high although variable in relation to compliance the guideline that the call be within 48 hours of hospital discharge. Home visits were offered at consistently high rates. Conclusion Policy enactment is sometimes inadequate to stimulate practice changes in health care. Policy as a tool for practice change must thoughtfully address the organizational, professional, and social contexts within which the policy is to be implemented. These contexts can either facilitate or block implementation. Our examination of Ontario's universal <b>postpartum</b> <b>program</b> provides an example of differential implementation of a common policy intended to change post-natal care practices that reflects the differential influence of context on implementation. </p...|$|R

Knowledge on how informal support is understood by its stakeholders {{to be able to}} improve the health in families after childbirth is required. This study aimed to explore discourses on health related informal support to first-time parents after childbirth in low-income suburbs of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: Thirteen focus group discussions with first-time parents and female and male informal supporters were analysed by discourse analysis. Results: The dominant discourse was that after childbirth a first time mother needed and should be provided with support for care of the infant, herself and the household work by the maternal or paternal mother or other close and extended family members. In their absence, neighbours and friends were described as reconstructing informal support. Informal support was provided conditionally, where poor socio-economic status and non-adherence to social norms risked poor support. Support to new fathers was constructed as less prominent, provided mainly by older men and focused on economy and sexual matters. The discourse conveyed stereotypic gender roles with women described as family caretakers and men as final decision-makers and financial providers. The informa...|$|R

However, no assessment or evaluation of postnatal educational materials has been done {{to determine the extent to}} which parents find available materials helpful. There is little empirical support for written and online postnatal materials, despite the fact that there is ample evidence for the need for postnatal education. The purpose of this practicum project was to obtain new parents’ perspectives and evaluation of postpartum educational materials. To achieve this purpose, I first conducted an integrative literature review of learning needs of new parents, and the value of postnatal educational materials.

Methods: The subjects consisted of 123 husbands who had children under the age of 5 years. Data were analyzed with t-test, one-way ANOVA, Scheffe?’s test, and Pearson’s correlation. Results: The mean age of subjects was 37. 1 ± 4. 63 years. The mean scores of awareness, needs for education on postpartum mother and newborn care, and family strength were 4. 57 ± 1. 18, 4. 61 ± 1. 18, 4. 92 ± 1. 07, and 4. 01 ± 0. 95, respectively, indicating higher scores.

The {{objective}} of the initiative was to expand the availability of and access to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection counseling and voluntary testing in the <b>postpartum</b> setting. <b>Programs</b> have been initiated in 24 hospitals statewide. The initiative emphasizes cooperative arrangements within participating hospitals for referring patients to medical and social services. Participation by hospitals in the initiative is voluntary. Initial grants to hospitals for the initiative ranged from $ 50, 000 to $ 80, 000. The main obstacle in implementing the initiative has been a lack of such resources as administrative or clinical support, phlebotomy services, and office or clinical space. During the period from August 1, 1990, through March 31, 1992, 16, 436 women at risk for HIV infection were counseled in the postpartum setting at 24 hospitals participating in the initiative. Of them, 6, 754 (41. 1 percent) consented to HIV testing. Of the 6, 754 tested, 3, 000 women (44. 5 percent) returned to receive test results and posttest counseling.

Their complex management sometimes requires haemostatic supplementation, and therapeutic trials on fibrinogen or activated factor VII, which may add to the thrombotic risk, are currently being considered. Furthermore, {{there is a risk}} of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the postpartum period, hence we studied the relationship between severe PPH and VTE in women during their first pregnancy. Among the 32, 463 women enrolled between January 1, 1999 and February 1, 2004 in the NOHA First cohort, 317 developed severe PPH, 11 postpartum VTE and 60 had postpartum superficial vein thrombosis (SVT). In the women with severe PPH, whilst there were no episodes of VTE, there were three episodes of SVT, which occurred 6 weeks postpartum. All of the women with severe PPH received packed red blood cell (RBC) units, 29 (9. 1 %) platelets units, 51 (16. 1 %) fresh frozen plasma and 29 (9. 1 %) fibrinogen concentrates. Three patients with both severe PPH and SVT received only packed RBC. Severe PPH or packed RBC unit transfusion were associated with postpartum SVT (adjusted relative risk: 5. 3 (1. 6 - 17) and 4. 7 (1. 5 - 15) respectively), independent of caesarean section delivery and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use in the postpartum, but were not independent indicators of one another.

The design of the study has been described in detail elsewhere (Anderberg et al. 2011; Ignell et al. 2013). Briefly, during the years 2003 – 2005, all pregnant women, representing different glucose categories according to an OGTT, were invited {{to take part in a}} 5 -year follow-up <b>program</b> <b>postpartum.</b> A 75 -g OGTT was offered to all women in the 28 th week of gestation, and also in gestational week 12 if they had had a history of GDM in previous pregnancies or a first-degree relative with diabetes. The diagnostic criteria for GDM used in the present study were a modification of those recommended by the WHO in 1999, defining GDM as the joint category of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) based on the 2 -h capillary plasma glucose concentration (World Health Organization 1999). A 2 -h capillary plasma glucose concentration below the limit for IGT was considered to be normal glucose tolerance (NGT) during pregnancy (GNGT) (World Health Organization 1999).|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} {{potential}} benefits of routine nurse home visiting after early discharge, we compared health service use among low-risk newborns with and without a nurse home visit and telephone follow-up after short hospital stays. Methods: Records of newborns discharged routinely before (n = 83) and after (n = 91) implementation of a universal <b>postpartum</b> home visiting <b>program</b> were reviewed retrospectively. Acute care visits, rehospital-izations, and well-baby visits for newborns up to 74 days of age were compared between the groups. Results: Acute care visits, rehospitaiizations, and missed well-baby visits consistently appeared less likely among newborns receiving home visiting services, in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Adjusting for insurance, parity, and breast-feeding, a twofold reduction in acute care visits by 14 days was significant. Although not statistically significant, adjusted analyses of acute care and missed well-baby visits revealed apparently similar patterns at all time intervals. There were too few rehospitalizations for multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Despite the limitations of this small retrospective study, the consistency of the findings suggests potentially important benefits of home visiting services after early discharge of low-risk newborns, with substantial implications for clinical and reimbursement policy. Effects could be greater with mor...|$|R
40|$|In Tanzania, {{and many}} sub-Saharan African countries, <b>postpartum</b> health <b>programs</b> have {{received}} less attention {{compared to other}} maternity care programs and therefore new parents rely on informal support. Knowledge on how informal support is understood by its stakeholders {{to be able to}} improve the health in families after childbirth is required. This study aimed to explore discourses on health related informal support to first-time parents after childbirth in low-income suburbs of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Thirteen focus group discussions with first-time parents and female and male informal supporters were analysed by discourse analysis. The dominant discourse was that after childbirth a first time mother needed and should be provided with support for care of the infant, herself and the household work by the maternal or paternal mother or other close and extended family members. In their absence, neighbours and friends were described as reconstructing informal support. Informal support was provided conditionally, where poor socio-economic status and non-adherence to social norms risked poor support. Support to new fathers was constructed as less prominent, provided mainly by older men and focused on economy and sexual matters. The discourse conveyed stereotypic gender roles with women described as family caretakers and men as final decision-makers and financial providers. The informal supporters regulated the first-time parents' contacts with other sources of support. Strong and authoritative informal support networks appear to persist. However, poverty and non-adherence to social norms was understood as resulting in less support. Family health in this context would be improved by capitalising on existing informal support networks while discouraging norms promoting harmful practices and attending to the poorest. Upholding stereotypic notions of femininity and masculinity implies great burden of care for the women and delimited male involvement. Men's involvement in reproductive and child health programmes has the potential for improving family health after childbirth. The discourses conveyed contradicting messages that may be a source of worry and confusion for the new parents. Recognition, respect and raising awareness for different social actors' competencies and limitations can potentially create a health-promoting environment among families after childbirth...|$|R
40|$|This {{quasi-experimental}} study integrated family planning, {{including the}} Lactational Amenorrhea Method, into community-based maternal and newborn {{health care and}} encouraged transition to other modern methods after 6 months to increase birth-to-pregnancy intervals. Community-based distribution of pills, condoms, and injectables, and referral for clinical methods, was added to meet women’s demand. Background: Short birth intervals are associated with increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal health (MNH) outcomes. Improving postpartum contraceptive use is an important programmatic strategy to improve {{the health and well-being}} of women, newborns, and children. This article documents the intervention package and evaluation design of a study conducted in a rural district of Bangladesh to evaluate the effects of an integrated, community-based MNH and <b>postpartum</b> family planning <b>program</b> on contraceptive use and birth-interval lengths. Intervention: The study integrated family planning counseling within 5 community health worker (CHW) -household visits to pregnant and postpartum women, while a community mobilizer (CM) led community meetings on the importance of postpartum family planning and pregnancy spacing for maternal and child health. The CM and the CHWs emphasized 3 messages: (1) Use of the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) during the first 6 months postpartum and transition to another modern contraceptive method; (2) Exclusive, rather than fully or nearly fully, breastfeeding t...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} 23 cases of puerperal laparoscopic sterilization performed within 72 hours of delivery. A new method was employed to avoid injury to the uterine fundus {{and to make the}} tubes more accessible. Before insertion of the Veress needle, the anterior and posterior lips of the cervix were held with forceps and Hulka&#x 2032;s uterine manipulator was introduced into the uterine cavity. The uterus was pulled down toward the introitus by applying traction to the sponge-holding forceps. Pneumoperitoneum of 3 - 4 liters was induced through use of a Veress needle, followed by introduction of a Storz single puncture operative laparoscope through an incision in the lower umbilical fold. Tubal occlusion was achieved with silastic bands. The average time required for sterilization from induction of general anesthesia was 6 minutes. There was no instance of injury to the uterine fundus, nor were there any cases of uterine perforation, injury to other pelvic structures, laceration of the cervix, or puerperal sepsis. At the time of follow-up 15 days after the procedure, all patients were in satisfactory condition. It is concluded that this method can enhance <b>postpartum</b> family planning <b>programs.</b> Since it can be carried out within the 1 st 48 hours after delivery, the routine hospital stay of 3 days {{does not have to be}} prolonged as a result of sterilization...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Postpartum</b> {{hemorrhage}} (PPH) is a {{major cause}} of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Several recent publications have noted an increasing trend in incidence over time. The international PPH collaboration was convened to explore the observed trends and to set out actions to address the factors identified. METHODS: We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of PPH over time in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, the incidence of PPH was stratified by cause. RESULTS: We observed an increasing trend in PPH, using heterogeneous definitions, in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. The observed increase in PPH in Australia, Canada and the USA was limited solely to immediate/atonic PPH. We noted increasing rates of severe adverse outcomes due to hemorrhage in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. CONCLUSION: Key Recommendations 1. Future revisions of the International Classification of Diseases should include separate codes for atonic PPH and PPH immediately following childbirth that is due to other causes. Also, additional codes are required for placenta accreta/percreta/increta. 2. Definitions of PPH should be unified; further research is required to investigate how definitions are applied in practice to the coding of data. 3. Additional improvement in the collection of data concerning PPH is required, specifically including a measure of severity. 4. Further research is required to determine whether an increased rate of reported PPH is also observed in other countries, and to further investigate potential risk factors including increased duration of labor, obesity and changes in second and third stage management practice. 5. Training should be provided to all staff involved in maternity care concerning assessment of blood loss and the monitoring of women after childbirth. This is key to reducing the severity of PPH and preventing any adverse outcomes. 6. Clinicians should be more vigilant given the possibility that the frequency and severity of PPH has in fact increased. This applies particularly to small hospitals with relatively few deliveries where management protocols may not be defined adequately and drugs or equipment may not be on hand to deal with unexpected severe PPH...|$|R
