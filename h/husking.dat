2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (<b>husking</b> or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosOlive <b>husk</b> is a {{by-product}} obtained from the industrial process for olive oil production containing oil, olive skin and stones. This olive <b>husk</b> is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain Olive Pomace Oil. The remaining oil in the <b>husk</b> is chemically extracted and finally, the residual <b>husk</b> is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The olive Pomace Oil from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, <b>husk</b> usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own <b>husk</b> chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received <b>husk</b> is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify <b>husk</b> qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality <b>husk</b> which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality <b>husk.</b> These mid term pools provide <b>husk</b> to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the <b>husk</b> quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store <b>husk</b> with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>husk</b> mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly <b>husk</b> pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending <b>husk</b> with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed.
