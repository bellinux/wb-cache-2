40|$|AbstractIn the Baltic Sea {{there is}} a severe {{conflict}} between small-scale fisheries and <b>gray</b> <b>seals.</b> One fishery severely affected by seal predation is the salmon trap fishery. Underwater cameras were placed in two pontoon traps to study the behavior of raiding <b>gray</b> <b>seals.</b> Seals observed on film were identified and a catalog of ‘problem’ seals was created, totaling 11 individuals. As part of this study, 8 pontoon traps modified for live-trapping raiding seals were {{set out in the}} same area. Trapped seals were killed and their markings photographed {{in order to try to}} match them with seals in the catalog. The eleven identified seals were responsible for 426 out of 600 visits to the two traps with cameras. Four of the eleven seals raided at least two traps and returned to raid traps frequently over the 2 -year study period. Seals caught in the pontoon traps modified for live-trapping were mainly adult male seals. Three of these seals were identified as cataloged seals. This study has shown that it is generally adult male <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> which have specialized in raiding fishing gear.

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{a long-term}} data {{set of the}} body condition of Baltic <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus) over time and investigated how average subcutaneous blubber thickness of different age groups of seals corresponds to environmental factors. Blubber thickness of pups declined until 2010. The decreasing weight of 5 – 6 -year-old herring (Clupea harengus),the main prey fish for Baltic <b>gray</b> <b>seals,</b> explained well the decline. In the Gulf of Finland, the blubber thickness of pups declined also in recent years (2011 – 2015) with declining number of days with permanent ice cover. In other regions, the blubber thickness of pups increased during recent years with increasing weight of herring. The blubber thickness of subadults in Baltic Proper and that of hunted adult females in the Bothnian Bay also increased during recent years, {{and the weight of}} age 6 + or 7 -year-old herring best explained the increase. The blubber thickness of all age groups of seals was thinnest in the Bothnian Bay where also herring weight was lowest. There was a negative correlation between blubber thickness of seals and herring catch size (an index of herring abundance) suggesting that herring quality, not the quantity, is important for the nutritional status of Baltic <b>gray</b> <b>seals.</b> Nutritional status of <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> may thus reveal changes in the marine food web which affect herring quality. Marine food web, in turn, may be affected, e. g., by climate change. The warming climate also has an impact on ice cover and thus body condition of seal pups...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{studying}} {{the influence of}} optical characteristics of sea water {{on the ability of}} earless seals to differentiate tablets of blue and red colours have been presented. The experiment involved four specimens of <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus, Fabricius, 1791), five species of harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus, Erxleben, 1777), and two ringed seals (Pusa hispida, Schreber, 1775). The seals have been trained to choose from a pair of plates the plate of blue colour and to mark it by touching. The experiments have been conducted on air (control study) to produce the sensitivity curve in the air without affecting transparency and colour depth and on 2 m underwater. It has been found that at the illumination above 50 lux in all model animals the proportion of correct answers corresponds to the control one and is 89 ± 3. 6 % for <b>gray</b> <b>seals,</b> 74. 8 ± 6. 2 % for harp seals, 71 ± 5. 7 % for ringed seals. When light level is reduced the proportion of correct answers decreases and becomes equal to the random selection at 15 lux for <b>gray</b> <b>seals,</b> 20 lux for harp seals and 25 lux for ringed seals. It has been shown that at the depth of 2 m with illumination below 50 lux the average number of errors for the experience slightly increases from 1. 2 to <b>gray</b> <b>seals,</b> harp seals at – 0. 6, in ringed seals – 1. 8.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the licensing system that permits seal shooting in Scotland, which was established under Part 6 Conservation of Seals of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. Four approaches were used: data were collated and analyzed from both the Scottish Government and Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme; a survey was sent to current license holders and informal {{interviews were conducted with}} key stakeholder types. Between February 2011 and the end of October 2015, 1229 <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> and 275 common seals were reported shot under license to the Scottish Government. The numbers of seals reported as shot has reduced year-on-year since the licensing system was put in place. While some license holders, notably fish farms, were using some non-lethal forms of deterrent to reduce seal-related damage, these were often used alongside seal shooting. Of the seals reported as shot to the Scottish Government, only a small percentage were also reported to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, despite this being a licensing requirement. Only 2. 3 % of the shot <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> and 4. 5 % of the shot common seals were necropsied. There is evidence from these necropsies that some seals had not died instantly or had not been shot in the manner recommended by the Scottish Seal Management Code of Practice. These preliminary results show that more carcasses need to be recovered and necropsied if the welfare implications of current seal shooting practice are to be properly assessed. The current legislation does not specify closed seasons to protect breeding seals and thirty-five per cent of necropsied <b>seals</b> were pregnant <b>gray</b> <b>seals.</b> Seals have also been shot during their lactation periods when pups are dependent on their mothers. This raises significant welfare concerns. The re-introduction of closed seasons specific to each species of seal is recommended along with greater effort to deploy non-lethal methods. Independent assessment of the number of seals being killed would also improve the credibility of the system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grpus) in the UK exhibit clear {{preferences}} for pupping close to pools {{of water on}} inland breeding sites. The reasons for this are unclear as seals are thought to derive all their water requirements from the metabolism of fat. Likewise, the prospect of seals overheating during the UK's cool, damp, autumnal breeding seasons, has seemed unlikely, but has not been previously explored. Here, we provide preliminary behavioral evidence of thermal stress in female <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> breeding {{on the island of}} North Rona, Scotland. Video footage provided measures of proximity to, and the proportion of animals bathing in, pools in relation to meteorological data (temperature, mean sea-level pressure, rainfall, wind speed and direction) on four dates spread through a single breeding season. The proportion of females close to pools increased with pressure (warmer, drier conditions) and decreased on wetter days. In addition, analyses of colony-wide patterns of seal dispersion showed that females tended to be closer to pools of water at higher pressures and temperatures and at lower wind-speeds. These results provide the first evidence of thermal stress and behavioral thermoregulation through access to pools of water in a phocid breeding in temperate autumnal conditions...|$|R

40|$|Surveys of <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus) {{during the}} molt period, {{when they are}} {{abundant}} on land, {{can be used to}} monitor changes in population size, but accurate interpretation of results requires an understanding of the molt process and how it may vary between years. This study investigates variability in onset (start date) and duration of visible molt by <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> in the Wadden Sea, and the influence of environmental conditions on the onset. Molt was monitored in nine captive seals and observed molt phases were applied to wild seals over seven annual molt periods between 2004 and 2010, monitored using aerial photography. The onset of visible molt varied significantly between years, for example it differed 28 d between 2008 and 2009. Model selection by AIC retained one environmental variable that correlated with molt onset; however, its effect was inconsistent within the molt season and did not explain some of the apparent observed annual variation. Hence, the main causes of interannual variability in the onset of molt remain unclear and warrant further study. Researchers should account for annual variability in the onset of molt when interpreting survey results based on molt counts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many phocids are capital breeders, {{relying on}} stored {{reserves}} to sustain energetic requirements while on land. Their large body size, high energy expenditure during lactation, and the insulative {{effects of the}} blubber layer can lead to thermal stress from overheating, especially in warm and temperate climates. Thermal stress can influence fine-scale site choice on breeding colonies, and behavioral thermoregulation has been proposed as {{an explanation for the}} clear preferences shown by breeding female <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> for proximity to pools of water. However, anecdotal observations suggest that pools of water may also be preferred for drinking, though water intake is difficult to verify without real-time physiological monitoring. Here, an alternative approach demonstrates that <b>gray</b> <b>seals</b> also require access to water for drinking. Using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis to examine fine-scale physical determinants of pupping site choice at North Rona, Scotland, we found that lactating mothers showed preference for lower salinity pools. This is most pronounced early in the season, when ambient temperatures and presumably thermal stress are greatest. Given that the cooling effect of fresh and salt water should be equivalent, the most parsimonious explanation for this preference for fresh water pools is that lactating females use these pools for drinking.
