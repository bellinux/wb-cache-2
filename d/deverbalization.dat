50|$|Clearly {{visible in}} oral translation, <b>deverbalization</b> is more {{difficult}} to observe in written translation because the original text does not disappear, as do the sounds of oral speech. The graphic signs remain on the page and seem to call for direct correspondences in the other language. <b>Deverbalization,</b> a natural feature of oral communication, would therefore seem to require an extra effort by translators. However, when graphic signs are immersed in context, translators interpret them directly into sense. This sense remains present as awareness while the signs fall into oblivion. This enables translators to discover in the target language modes of expression bearing little or no relation to the signs of the original language.|$|E
5000|$|ITT adds one further element, <b>deverbalization,</b> to {{comprehension}} and reformulation, the two translation stages usually described: Most {{of the sounds}} or graphic signs disappear as soon as comprehension sets in. We all experience <b>deverbalization</b> in everyday communication: we keep in mind facts, notions, events conveyed by words, {{but we do not}} retain these words in our memory. The ITT found support for this postulate in neuropsychology, which suggests that language and thought are located in different areas in the brain. Anticipation of sense, which often occurs in oral communication and oral translation, [...] is one more proof that, in context and situation, a full verbal support is not always necessary for comprehension to take place.|$|E
50|$|According to ITT, {{the process}} of {{translation}} {{is divided into three}} stages: comprehension, <b>deverbalization,</b> and reformulation; furthermore, <b>deverbalization</b> assumes a vital role between both comprehension and reformulation. ITT first developed on the basis of empirical practice and observation of interpreting. Oral translation lends itself better than written translation to a detailed examination of the cognitive process of translation. Oral speech is evanescent, its sounds disappear instantly, but sense remains. Interpreters’ formulations in another language show clearly that sense is the consequence of comprehension, itself made up of two elements: contextualized language meanings and cognitive complements. So ITT started with the study of oral translation, focusing on comprehension. Soon, however, practicing translators and translation scholars recognized the validity of the theory for written translation and went on to extend it to the study of pragmatic, technical, but also literary texts.ITT found an explanation of comprehension in Piaget’s assimilation/accommodation principle, according to which to understand, we integrate new information to prior knowledge and this prior knowledge adjusts to the new situation. Comprehension means adding extra linguistic knowledge to linguistic signs, new information constantly enriching extra linguistic knowledge. Later, language philosophers and psychologists documented this fact in their studies of comprehension. ITT recognized that sense is not contained in any language or text as such but arises from cues given by the language of the written text or oral discourse plus cognitive inputs from the target reader or listener. Here again, various researchers later corroborated this view.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{into account}} the ‘underdeterminacy of {{language}}’ ITT refers to the ‘synecdochic nature’ of language and discourse (a part for a whole). Explicit wording seldom makes sense unless supplemented by an implicit part consciously left unsaid by authors or speakers but understood by readers or listeners. The explicit layer of texts {{is a series of}} synecdoches. Linguistic formulation alone does not unlock the whole of sense, it only points to the whole. Since languages differ not only in their lexicon and grammar but also in the way natives speakers express their thoughts, the combination of explicit and implicit parts is not the same in any two languages even though they may designate the same whole. The very fact that language is underdetermined is one more element in support of <b>deverbalization.</b> It gives oral and written translators a large measure of freedom and creativity in their reformulation of authors’ or speakers’ intended meanings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Interpreting {{has become}} very {{important}} in the modern society. But interpreting teaching has always focused on exercises, not quality. The establishment of MTI in China has not solved this problem. This article attempts to identify effective teaching strategies by conducting an empirical study with Interpretive Theory. Index Terms—interpreting, interpretive theory, teaching strategies I. RESEARCH BACKGROUND The Interpretive Theory was first proposed by Seleskovitch and Lederer, professors of ESIT. The core is <b>deverbalization,</b> which holds that interpreting {{is not just a}} change from source language to target language. It is a kind of reformulation on the basis of understanding. Therefore, the interpreting process can be divided into three stages: understanding of the source language, <b>deverbalization</b> and re-expression on the basis of understanding. And sense unit has informed the three stages. Setton has done some research on the interpreting process from the perspective of cognition and pragmatics. He (1999) holds that interpreting requires three capacities: expressiveness, language processing and cognition, the third of which could be reckoned as <b>deverbalization.</b> Bassnet (2002) points out that translation involves not only substitution of words and grammar from the cultural context of language. Therefore, equivalence in translation is not about seeking sameness, and it's very dangerous to impose the value system of the source language onto the target language. Ba...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the derivations of the DE construction, showing that an antecedent-free DE construction is derived by <b>deverbalization</b> and an antecedent-dependent DE construction is derived by ellipsis. Semantically, the former process is substantivization {{and the latter}} defocalization. Relating the antecedent-dependent DE construction to other nominal ellipses and the verb gapping construciton, I discuss {{a new type of}} ellipsis which can take an ellipsis site as its linguistic antecedent. Furthermore, I argue that the syntactic status of the word de in a nominal is a functional category, heading an nP consistently...|$|E

It uses various aspects of translation theory, including Skopos theory, <b>deverbalization,</b> and intralinguistic translation, to explore reasons that EU translations are still notoriously murky and unclear and to make recommendations for applying PLM guidelines to future EU translations. It concludes with a case study comparing standard and plain-language French>English translations of an EU text...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNominalized constructions {{are a very}} {{frequent}} {{phenomenon in}} Oceanic languages, used in nominal, relative, or imperative clauses as arguments, adjuncts, or the prototypical expression of exclamations. I provide evidence that contrary to widespread views, tense, negation, and aspect markers do occur in nominalizations. I then examine restrictions on the occurrence of these markers, {{as well as of}} some articles, and try to find historical explanations. Lastly, I show that hierarchical constraints often formulated for nominalization and <b>deverbalization</b> processes do not fully apply to Oceanic languages, since the occurrence of tense and aspect markers is not only attested in lexical nominalizations but is also quite frequent in phrasal and clausal nominalizations, that is, at the syntactic and discourse levels as well...|$|E
40|$|While many {{professional}} translators {{believe the}} ability to translate is a gift that one either has or does not have, Allison Beeby Lonsdale questions this view.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative empirical exploratory study of some cognitive {{aspects of the}} oral and written translation process within the translation competence construct. This research has a twofold objective: finding some evidence of specific translation competence skills in translation tasks and comparing these data in sight translation and written translation in order to empirically check if sight translation can really be considered an interpreting modality. A sample of 22 Translation and Interpretation students after the final last year examinations was used. They performed a sight translation and a written translation of the same text and answered retrospective questionnaires regarding causes of problems, and strategies used to solve them. Errors were assessed afterwards using three basic criteria: non-sens, faux sens and contresens. Results showed quantitative and qualitative differences in number of problems, their causes and strategies used. It also revealed more errors in sight translation. Qualitative results have been successfully incorporated to the PACTE translation competence model showing that empirical data corroborate the theoretical model. Specific results also show that psycho-physiological components are more relevant in sight translation, {{as it is the}} case in interpreting modalities, and knowledge about translation referring to reexpression, <b>deverbalization,</b> master of translation units is more relevant in written translatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{function}} of “participles” (also known as “verbal nouns”) in Shinekhen Buryat, which belongs to the Mongolic language family. In the Altaic linguistics, verbal inflections are classified into three inflectional categories. 1) Finite forms (including indicatives and optatives); 2) converbs; and 3) participles. However, some “participles” seem to be less inflectional than the other “prototypical participles. ” Therefore, by using Malchukov’s (2006) functional hierarchy of recategorization, we examine {{the situation of the}} decategorization (<b>deverbalization)</b> and recategorization (nominalization) of each of the “participles. ” Furthermore, we will see that {{it is very difficult to}} classify some inflectional forms into “participles” or “converbs,” since such forms have both participial (modifying nouns) and converbial functions (modifying verbs). In conclusion, I will suggest the following two points: a) We can recognize some of the “participles,” which are more deverbalized than the “prototypical participles,” as the deverbal nominals rather than verbal inflections. b) In Shinekhen Buryat, we can not simply classify all the inflectional forms into three categories (finite forms, converbs, and participles). It does not seem to be suitable to classify non-finite forms into participles and converbs. We should reconsider the verbal inflections of the Altaic languages in a new framework...|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} the lingual and extralingual peculiarities of the performative speech acts of {{prohibition}} and permission in Ukrainian languages are investigated. Despite {{the presence of}} a significant amount of research on selected issues, we consider unsolved questions about the functioning of prohibition and permission acts as performative in Ukrainian speech, so this theme is still actual. The main task – to identify typical and atypical performative acts of prohibition and permission in Ukrainian language, full and modified syntactic constructions in which they operate, as well as contextual features, namely influence of extralinguistic factors on functioning of these acts, as appropriate. In the process of research we determined that the typical performative speech prohibition and permission acts are explicit performative verbs forbid, permit, allow, authorize, bless. The means of expression of so-called non-standard (non-typical) implementations serve performative modal verbs, verbs of denial, impersonal forms of the verb, passive verbs constructions, imperative forms of the verb, <b>deverbalization.</b> The full sentence form of implementation of these acts is complex sentences with subordinate elucidative part, modified form – asyndetic complex sentences, compound constructions, simple sentences. For expressiveness of speech prohibition and permission acts intensifiers and specifiers serve. To intensify actions adverbs are used, for its specificity – appeals, other nouns and phrases that serve to clarify individual speaker or addressee...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{analysis}} of a translation of the text ”A Lotta Night Music: The Sound of Film Noir” written by Richard R. Ness. The study focuses on the adaption of film and music terminology as well as complex sentence structures for a new and broader target audience. The analysis was accomplished {{with the help of}} Marianne Lederer’s theory of <b>deverbalization</b> and re-expression. Furthermore, Vinay and Darbelnet’s methodology for translation was utilized along with Andrew Chesterman’s syntactic strategies in order to help clarify the restructuring.                       First of all, concerning film and music terminology, the main issue of interest was how to best adapt the terms for the target readers. From the analysis of various examples of difficult terminology it was concluded that the strategy best used for the different terms depends on the presupposed knowledge of the target reader. Whether you borrow, translate literally or adapt is a matter of how much the target reader knows beforehand.                       Secondly, as for the complex sentence structures of this highly academic text, the extensive, highly hypotactic sentences were extracted and broken down into shorter sentences while keeping the author’s message intact. In this way, the readability was increased and hence the text was adapted for a wider target audience. Moreover, the fact that readability increased was proven with the aid of LIX, a means of measuring the degree of difficulty of a specific text.                       Finally, it has been determined in this study that, although this particular text is still highly academic, breaking down overly long sentences generally helps to increase readability without compromising the author’s intended message...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the morphosyntactic {{features and functions}} of the constructions je dois dire (que) ‘I must say (that) ’ and (il) faut dire (que) ‘it is necessary to say (that) ’ in French and their correspondences in Lithuanian. The study is corpus-based and the data have been retrieved from the bidirectional parallel corpus CTLFR-LT-FR. The thorough semantic functional analysis of the construction je dois dire (que) ‘I must say (that) ’ in the CTLFR-LT shows that the verbs devoir ‘must’ and dire ‘say’ clearly express the meanings of necessity and saying. However, in initial position the construction with the complementizer que ‘that’ represents a lexical variant {{and may not be}} functionally transparent. Its functional indeterminacy may be clarified by its prosodic realizations. The conceptual meanings of the verbs devoir ‘must’ and dire ‘say’ in the construction je dois dire (que) ‘I must say (that) ’ are bleached and the construction may function as a marker that initiates conversation with the addressee, expresses the author’s argumentation and links clauses or parts of discourse. In initial and medial position, it may hedge an utterance or modify a word or a phrase. Thus the construction je dois dire (que) ‘I must say (that) ’ is not primary in the communicative structure of the sentence and functions as a marker of author stance. The construction (il) faut dire (que) ‘it is necessary to say (that) ’ is less frequent in the CTLFR-LT and displays minor structural variation. It shows traces of parentheticalization, namely <b>deverbalization</b> (omission of the formal subject il), omission of the complementizer que ‘that’, syntactic mobility in the sentence, semantic bleaching of the verbs falloir ‘need’ and dire ‘say’, alternation with mental verbs (Pusch 2007), interpersonal and intertextual functions. The structure (il) faut dire + NP ‘it is necessary + NP’ clearly expresses the meaning of necessity to say. The Lithuanian constructions turiu pasakyti/pripažinti ‘I must say/admit’ and reikia pasakyti/pripažinti ‘it is necessary to say/admit’ in the CTLLT-FR are not statistically significant and functionally they do not differ from the equivalent constructions in French. The data in the CTLFR-LT-FR and the CCLL (Contemporary Corpus of the Lithuanian Language) reveal that the constructions under study are not dominant either in French or Lithuanian but possible in authentic language use. Although the generalizations made above should be corroborated by more empirical data, the present study contributes to the research on parenthetical constructions in French and Lithuanian and can be supplemented by the analysis of the constructions in academic discourse...|$|E
