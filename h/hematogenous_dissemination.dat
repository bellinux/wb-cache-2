50|$|In {{countries}} where cow milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis has been eliminated (due to culling of infected cows and pasteurization), primary tuberculosis is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{and almost always}} begins in the lungs. Typically, the inhaled bacilli implant in the distal airspaces of {{the lower part of}} the upper lobe or the upper part of the lower lobe, usually close to the pleura. As sensitization develops, a 1- to 1.5-cm area of gray-white inflammation with consolidation emerges, known as the Ghon focus. In most cases, the center of this focus undergoes caseous necrosis. Tubercle bacilli, either free or within phagocytes, drain to the regional nodes, which also often caseate.

40|$|Abstract Background Surgical hepatic {{resection}} {{remains the}} treatment of choice for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer despite the use of alternative therapeutic strategies. Although this procedure provides long-term survival in {{a significant number of}} patients, 50 – 75 % of the patients develop intra- and/or extrahepatic recurrence. One possible reason for tumor recurrence may be intraoperative <b>hematogenous</b> tumor cell <b>dissemination</b> due to mechanical manipulation of the tumor during hepatic resection. Surgical technique may have an influence on hematogenous tumor cell spread. We hypothesize that <b>hematogenous</b> tumor cell <b>dissemination</b> may be reduced by using the anterior approach technique compared to conventional liver resection. Methods/Design This is a multi-centre prospective randomized controlled, superiority trial to compare two liver resection techniques of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. 150 patients will be included and randomized intraoperatively after surgical exploration just prior to resection. The primary objective is to compare the anterior approach with the conventional liver resection technique with regard to intraoperative haematogenous tumor cell dissemination. As secondary objectives we examine five year survival rates (OS and DFS), blood loss, duration of operation, requirement of blood transfusions, morbidity rate, prognostic relevance of tumor cell detection in blood and bone marrow and the comparison of tumor cell detection by different detection methods. Conclusion This trial will answer the question whether there is an advantage for the anterior approach technique compared to the conventional resection group with regard to tumor cell dissemination. It will also add further information about prognostic differences, safety, advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Trial registration Current controlled trials – ISRCTN 45066244 </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{neurotropic}} {{virus is}} said to be neuroinvasive if it is capable of accessing or entering the nervous system and neurovirulent if it is capable of causing disease within the nervous system. Both terms are often applied to central nervous system infections, although some neurotropic viruses are highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system (i.e. herpes simplex virus). Important neuroinvasive viruses include poliovirus, which is highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive, and rabies virus, which is highly neurovirulent but requires tissue trauma (often resulting from an animal bite) to become neuroinvasive. Using these definitions, herpes simplex virus is highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system and rarely neuroinvasive for the central nervous system, but in the latter case may cause herpesviral encephalitis and is therefore considered highly neurovirulent. Many arthropod-borne neurotropic viruses, like West Nile virus, spread to the brain primarily via the blood system by crossing the blood-brain barrier in what is called <b>hematogenous</b> <b>dissemination.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{character}} of acute and latent {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) infection of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in mice depended on the route by which the virus reached the ganglion, the level of systemic host resistance, {{and the integrity of}} postganglionic nerves. Prevention of ganglionic infection by postganglionic neurectomy carried out before intraocular (i. o.) virus challenge established the importance of the neural route in the development of SCG infection. However, <b>hematogenous</b> virus <b>dissemination</b> also led to SCG infection although with reduced frequency compared to that with i. o. inoculation. Enhanced host systemic antiviral resistance had two divergent effects on ganglionic infection depending on the dose and timing of virus inoculation. Thus, both acute and latent ganglionic infections were concomitantly reduced when resistant C 57 B 1 / 6 mice were challenged with low doses of virus or when less resistant BALB/c mice were actively immunized 1 week before virus challenge. On the other hand, when resistant mice were challenged with high doses of virus or when either active or passive (antibody) immunization was delayed long enough to assure viral access to the ganglion, intraganglionic viral replication during the acute phase of infection was reduced, but the prevalence of subsequent latent infection was either unaffected or actually enhanced. Postganglionic neurectomy, performed after virus had reached the ganglion, altered the course of SCG infection in a direction opposite that of immunization, augmenting the acute phase of viral replication while reducing latency. In athymic nude mice and mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, intraganglionic viral replication was prolonged. These results emphasize that host factors both extrinsic and intrinsic to the SCG modify the course of ganglionic infection...|$|R

40|$|Tissue factor (TF), the {{initiating}} cell surface receptor of the coagulation cascade, plays {{important roles}} in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell metastasis. It is controversial whether proteolytic function of TF complexed with its serine protease ligand VIIa is required for metastatic tumor dissemination. We show here in a model for TF-dependent experimental hematogenous metastasis, that TF supports metastasis by both proteolytic activity of the TF-VIIa complex and currently undefined functions of the cytoplasmic domain. We demonstrate that ligand binding of VIIa to TF is required for metastasis. Antimetastatic properties of covalently inactivated VIIa provide evidence that ligand binding is insufficient per se to support metastasis, emphasizing that proteolytic activity {{is necessary for the}} metastatic process. Ala or Asp mutations of cytoplasmic serine residues were introduced to preclude or mimic phosphorylation. In vivo analysis of these mutants suggests that local protease generation on the tumor cell surface does not serve simply to activate the cytoplasmic domain of TF by serine phosphorylation.

The lesions were characterized by their number, topography, and MRI signal. Dissemination to the brain resulted from direct spread from paranasal sinuses in 8 patients, 6 of them being immunocompetent. <b>Hematogenous</b> <b>dissemination</b> was observed in 13 patients, all were immunosuppressed. In this later group we identified a total of 329 parenchymal abscesses involving the whole brain with a predilection for the corticomedullary junction.

In addition to the inherent complexity of {{each one of the}} aforementioned phenomena is the lack of an experimental technique capable of dissecting the mechanisms that mediate the dynamic invasive and migratory behavior at the cellular level and with respect to the properties of the cell environment. The goal of my thesis was to develop an automated system for cell tracking in three dimensions and use it to model the dynamics of cancer invasion and migration. Therefore the hardware and software were designed for a fully automated optical 3 D cell tracking system that quantified long-term invasion and migration of cancer cells infiltrating 3 D extracellular matrix analogs. The quantitative analysis of the cell trajectories employed a novel formulation of the continuous Markov model that evaluated the potential for invasive or lateral motion and cell stops. The infiltration of human HT 1080 fibrosarcoma and human MDA-MB- 231 adenocarcinoma cells, was monitored in plain or Matrigel-containing collagen type I gels. Parameters such as the speed subpopulations, the persistence of motion in certain directions, the turning frequency of the cells, the preferred directions of motion, and the invasion depth profiles over time quantified infiltration at the cellular level. Distinct migratory and invasive phenotypes significantly dependent on the gel composition were identified for the two cell types. The HT 1080 cell line expressed a high motility phenotype and well-preserved lateral motion on the plain collagen gel surface. The basement membrane components transformed the HT 1080 cells to robust invaders by significantly enhancing the matrix infiltration and the turning frequency. The low motility, slow invasion and low turning behavior of MDA-MB- 231 cells indicated that their invasiveness may depend on matrix-degrading activity.

40|$|PURPOSE: Tumor markers are {{substances}} {{found in}} blood and other biological fluids if tumor {{is present in the}} body. They can be produced by tumor itself or can be results of cancer - body relation. They may be used in the follow-up of cancer patients to identify tumor recurrence. Pre-treatment levels have prognostic tool and could signalize persistence of minimal residual disease despite radical surgery. METHODS: We operated on 52 patients with upper GI malignancy (32 with gastric cancer and 20 with pancreatic cancer). Blood samples were taken before surgery and peritoneal samples immediately after laparotomy before any manipulation with tumor. All samples were examined by standard biochemical technique and the level was compared with a stage of the disease. RESULTS: Patients suffering from gastric carcinoma of stage I and II had higher level of both markers in sera then in the peritoneal cavity, however most of them were within physiological range. Patients in stage III and IV had average marker levels in the peritoneal cavity higher than in sera. Number of positive findings was increasing according to the stage of the disease. The peritoneal levels of both markers varied extremely in higher stages. In patients suffering from pancreatic carcinoma the CEA levels both in sera and peritoneal cavity were parallel but peritoneal levels were slightly higher in stages III and IV. Ca 19 - 9 was more sensitive for pancreatic cancer. The percentage of positive findings was higher in sera but the level of Ca 19 - 9 was higher in the peritoneal cavity. The number of positive findings again correlated with the stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of tumor markers in sera could signalize inoperability of tumor (Ca 19 - 9 in cases of pancreatic carcinoma); peritoneal levels could predict R 1 resection especially in gastric cancer patients and risk of early peritoneal recurrence of the disease.
