This technology is termed as STATCOM. It will be utilized in the night for power factor correction and voltage control at the terminals of an induction motor operating at poor power factor. PV solar farms produce power {{during the day and}} are completely idle in the nights. The proposed new control on PV solar system will help in increase the utilization of the PV solar system. A key component of the PV solar plant is a voltage source converter which is also a core element of STATCOM. Using this fact we present a simple open-loop control method of using PV solar plant as STATCOM, in dark periods without sunlight, for load reactive power compensation and voltage control. PV system inverter control is not suitable for night time. Improvement of power factor leading to decrease the continuous load KVA load demand and reduction in the line losses...|$|E

Although some models took beach slopes into account, most of the calibrated data were from flat-bed experiments, and most experiments were carried out on a rather small scale. Under the framework of the European Large <b>Installation</b> <b>Plan,</b> to achieve high quality and high resolution data on hydrodynamics and sediment transport dynamics on a natural 2 DV beach under equilibrium, erosive and accretive conditions, a programme of detailed measurements of hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the surf zone has been carried out in DELFT HYDRAULICS' Delta Flume in the period from April to June 1993 (DELFT HYDRAULICS 1994). Hence a set of new data about beach evolution and acting velocity moments has become available.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} work we have carried out {{over the last years}} on the {{development}} of ultrashort-laser-pulse-driven, rewritable, phase-change optical memories. The materials we have tailored for this application are non-stoichiometric, Sb-rich amorphous thin films, which can be crystallized upon irradiation with ultrashort laser pulses, showing a large optical contrast upon transformation. This result makes them very promising for the development of rewritable phase-change optical memories under ultrashort pulses, since the reversibility of the process has also been demonstrated. Adequate control of the heat-flow conditions has allowed us to achieve a full transformation time faster than 400 ps for crystallization/amorphization using 30 -ps pulses. The crystallization threshold fluence has been found to decrease upon irradiation with pulses shorter than 800 fs, thus suggesting the relevance of high-electronic-excitation-induced processes in the amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition. This has been confirmed by the observation of an ultrafast, non-thermal phase transition occurring 200 - 300 fs after the arrival of the laser pulse at the surface, for fluences above the crystallization threshold. The presence of this transient phase conditions the final state induced therefore enabling the applicability of this material as a rewritable recording medium using femtosecond pulses.
