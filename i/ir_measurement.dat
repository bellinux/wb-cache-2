40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of outdoor weathering on the degradation rate of unstabilized bisphenol A polycarbonate (BPA-PC) films is investigated and {{compared to the}} results found for indoor accelerated weathering conditions, using UV and IR spectroscopy. At the same dosage, changes in UV and IR were larger for the accelerated than for the outdoor weathered samples, this {{could be explained by}} the lower degradation temperature during outdoor exposures. The difference between outdoor and accelerated weathering is according to the <b>IR</b> <b>measurement</b> larger than according to the UV measurement. This difference is ascribed to difference in wavelength distribution between the spectra of the light emitted in the accelerated test and from the terrestrial sunlight. The larger difference for the IR results than for the UV results suggests a difference in ratio between photo-Fries rearrangements and photo-oxidation reaction between both exposures...|$|E
40|$|ISBN 0769523412 Microsystems {{are usually}} {{affected}} by multiple failure sources.
