5000|$|Valerianella locusta {{is a small}} annual {{plant that}} is eaten as a leaf vegetable. It has a {{characteristic}} nutty flavor, dark green color, and soft texture, and is popularly served as salad greens. [...] Common names include corn salad, common cornsalad, lamb's lettuce, mâche (...) , fetticus, feldsalat, nut lettuce, <b>field</b> <b>salad,</b> and rapunzel. In restaurants that feature French cooking, it may be called doucette or raiponce, {{as an alternative to}} mâche, by which it is best known. [...] In German-speaking Switzerland it is known as Nüsslisalat or Nüssler, terms that have been borrowed by the area's many English-speakers. It is typically served as a salad with chopped, hard boiled eggs and crumbled bacon.|$|E
6000|$|One {{last trip}} {{he was making}} to Skyland before departing to other <b>salad</b> <b>fields.</b> Skyland was a regular post-office, and the steamboat, Dixie Belle, under contract, {{delivered}} the mail bag (generally empty) twice a week. There was a little business there to be settled--the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services, and the [...] "inhabitants" [...] had to be furnished with another month's homely rations, as per agreement. And then Skyland would know J. Pinkney Bloom no more. The owners of these precipitous, barren, useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity, or they might leave them to their fit tenants, the wild hog and the browsing deer. The work of the Skyland Real Estate Company was finished.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is a {{prevalent}} pest of glasshouse {{and field}} vegetables, such as leeks and salad onions. Pesticides {{are the main}} option for control, but this approach risks the evolution and spread of insecticide resistance. In the light of anecdotal reports in the United Kingdom of poor efficacy of pyrethroids against T. tabaci, thought to be primarily a consequence of resistance, the responses to deltamethrin of ten English samples of T. tabaci, collected from <b>field</b> leeks and <b>salad</b> onions in 2006, were measured to establish the level and prevalence of potential resistance to this compound. RESULTS: All the samples showed significant deltamethrin resistance that was comparable or slightly lower than the maximum level reported previously for T. tabaci from New Zealand. CONCLUSION: The mechanism(s) conferring deltamethrin resistance remain unknown at present but are likely to extend to other synthetic pyrethroids approved for use against this species. The findings suggest that these compounds are unlikely to give satisfactory control of T. tabaci in England and have stimulated the recommendation to use alternatives.

40|$|Abstract 	Downy mildew {{is caused}} by plant {{parasitic}} Oomycetes from the genus Hyaloperonospora and the genus Peronospora. Downy mildew is a common disease of brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops. This thesis surveys downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. with focus on the rocket salad species. 	The susceptibility experiment was carried out to research the host specificity of plant parasitic Oomycetes Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. on rocket salad (wild rocket, Diplotaxis tenuifolia and cultivated rocket salad, Eruca sativa) and other chosen crops from the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, swede, oil seeds rape) at the seedlings stage. Seedlings were inoculated with different isolates (frozen plant material from 2008, diseased brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops from the fields in Norway and diseased cruciferous weeds grown close to the fields with the Brassicaceae family crops). The experiment {{has shown that the}} pathogen from a certain host plant species was more aggressive on plants of the same species. The pathogen from the host plant D. tenuifolia was significantly more aggressive on seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The pathogen from the host plant broccoli was more aggressive on broccoli seedlings, but was also capable to infect cauliflower, swede and oilseed rape. The pathogen from host plant swede was more aggressive on seedlings of swede, but disease was observed also on cauliflower and broccoli. 	The thesis also covers a survey of the survival of conidia in the air. The spores of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. were exposed to solar radiation for different time intervals. Afterwards, the viability of these spores was evaluated. Results from the experiment indicate a certain decreasing trend in the viability of spores over the time of their exposure. 	The third experimental part surveys whether the overwintering structures of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. in the soil can cause an infection on the seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The soil from the <b>fields,</b> where rocket <b>salad</b> was grown previous years, was sampled. An occurrence of the disease on the seedlings of D.  tenuifolia was observed. The disease was not observed on the experimental seedlings...|$|R
