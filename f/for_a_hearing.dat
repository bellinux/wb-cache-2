5|$|In July 1676 Carbery called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> against Morgan {{in front}} of the Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to a decision on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|Ventidius Cumanus (fl. 1st century AD) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c. AD 52. A {{disagreement}} between the surviving sources, the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman Tacitus, makes it unclear whether his authority was over {{some or all}} of the province. Cumanus' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population. Ventidius Cumanus failed to respond to an anti-Jewish murder in Samaritan territory which led to the violent conflict between Jews and Samaritans. Following an investigation by the governor of Syria, Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, Cumanus was sent to Rome <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> before the Emperor Claudius, who held him responsible for the violence and sentenced him to exile.|$|E

5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E

25|$|Reconsideration {{involves}} a re-examination {{of the evidence}} and, in some cases, the opportunity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> before a (non-attorney) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer then issues a decision in writing, providing justification for his/her finding. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an Administrative Law Judge.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} be heard refers to the right for a party's case to be heard before a {{decision}} is made. Even if a statute does not state the requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing,</b> it {{does not necessarily mean that}} a hearing will never be required. However, this right is neither automatic nor absolute. For instance, in Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law a convicted offender seeking mercy had no {{right to be}} heard during the clemency process. In Singapore, this situation is reflected by the absence of any provision in Article 22P of the Constitution for an offender to be heard during the clemency process.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> to be fair, {{the person}} who will be {{affected}} by the hearing's outcome must be given sufficient notice to allow him or her to adequately prepare his or her case; he or she must be entitled to know what evidence has been produced against him or her; and that there must be a proper opportunity to contest, contradict or correct any evidence, state one's case and raise relevant matters before the court. In addition, a fair hearing may also include the rights to legal representation, to cross-examine witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{the judge}} {{dismissed}} several potential jurors for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors and the prosecutor, Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury {{on the ground}} that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing,</b> the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.|$|E

However, Foreign Minister Downer considered {{it unlikely that}} the Singaporean government would agree. On 24 November 2005, Victorian Attorney General Rob Hulls met with Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Ho Peng Kee to press the case for clemency but was unsuccessful. On 28 November 2005 Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, Sev Ozdowski, said Australia must keep pressuring Singapore to abandon the death penalty, even if it proves too late for Nguyen.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{applying}} in the UK, procedural {{legitimate expectation}} {{was approved by}} the Federal Court of Australia in GTE (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Brown (1986). In the case, the Minister of State for Administrative Services, acting on behalf of the Minister of State for Industry and Commerce, imposed anti-dumping duties on the applicant. The applicant brought legal proceedings claiming that the authorities had denied it natural justice by failing to comply with a promise to provide an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> towards the close of the investigation on whether the duties should be levied, and by departing from certain procedures. Applying Ng Yuen Shiu and the GCHQ case, the Court agreed that the applicant's legitimate expectation had been frustrated by the failure to conduct a hearing, and that it had been unfair for the authorities not to follow the procedures.|$|E
25|$|For a period, Fromm {{was also}} active in U.S. politics. He joined the Socialist Party of America in the mid-1950s, and {{did his best}} to help them provide an {{alternative}} viewpoint to the prevailing McCarthyism of the time. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy. However, as a co-founder of SANE, Fromm's strongest political activism was in the international peace movement, fighting against the nuclear arms race and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After supporting Senator Eugene McCarthy's losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he did write a paper in 1974 entitled Remarks on the Policy of Dรฉtente <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.|$|E

25|$|On 7 October 2005, George {{was arrested}} in Manhattan on {{suspicion}} of cocaine possession and falsely reporting a burglary. George denied that the drug was his. In court on 1 February 2006, the cocaine possession charge was dropped and George pleaded guilty to falsely reporting a burglary. He was sentenced to five days of community service, fined US$1,000 and ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation programme. On 17 June 2006, a Manhattan judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Boy George after he failed {{to appear in court}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on why George wanted to change his sentence for the false burglary report. George's attorney informed the court that he had advised George not to appear at that hearing.
