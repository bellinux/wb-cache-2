In the <b>fungicide</b> or insecticide mixed with plant growth hormone treated soil sample, the total viable number of soil microbiota was found to be higher than that of the soil treated with <b>fungicide</b> or insecticide alone. Moderate effect of insecticide used on the total number of fungi was observed. On the other hand the effect of insecticide on soil bacteria was more than effect of <b>fungicide,</b> and the negative effect of <b>fungicide</b> on soil bacteria was observed particularly at latent periods (15 and 20 days) of application. A great sensitivity to <b>fungicide</b> and insecticide was observed in the case of nitrogen fixing bacteria. At 15 days after <b>fungicide</b> and insecticide application the adverse effect was found. Morphological deformations were clear in A. flavus cultivated on medium containing <b>fungicide,</b> the fungus failed to form conidiospores, conidiophores and vesicles.

40|$|Prior on-station {{research}} {{showed that}} sowing dates, sowing density and applications of <b>fungicide</b> and phosphorus (P) increased groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) pod yield by 60 – 80 %. Farmer-managed trials {{were conducted in}} the Wa district of the Upper West Region of Ghana from 2004 to 2007 to test the yield response to sowing density, <b>fungicide</b> and P and to assess economic returns of these technologies to farmers. Treatments included: an early maturing groundnut cultivar, Chinese, sown at farmers’ density (5 – 8 plant m− 2) without <b>fungicide</b> and without P application (T 1, control), with <b>fungicide</b> sprays alone (T 2), or with <b>fungicide</b> and P application (T 3), cultivar Chinese sown at recommended (higher) density (20 plant m− 2) with <b>fungicide</b> and P application (T 4), and a full season cultivar, Manipinter, with <b>fungicide</b> and P application (T 5). Soil fertility, sowing density, days from sowing to first weeding, incidence and severity of leaf-spot disease and plant population at final harvest were recorded. Relative to farmers’ practice, pod yield of cultivar Chinese was significantly increased by 80 % with <b>fungicide</b> sprays alone, 108 % with <b>fungicide</b> and P application, and 113 % with <b>fungicide</b> and P application at higher sowing density. Cultivar Manipinter treated with <b>fungicide</b> and P gave 107 % increase in pod yield relative to farmers’ practice. Correlation and stepwise regression analyses suggested that major determinants of groundnut pod yield in farmers’ fields were plant density, leaf-spot disease and P availability. The increase in yield with <b>fungicide</b> and P application translated into a 4 – 5 -fold increase in gross margin for farmers in the region.

5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, <b>fungicides,</b> and wood preservatives.|$|E

5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as <b>fungicides</b> for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide. Other commercial <b>fungicides</b> developed from the strobilurins include Allegro, and Brio (kresoxim-methyl) Amistar.|$|E
5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and <b>fungicides</b> with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some <b>fungicides,</b> may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of copper <b>fungicide</b> {{has been shown}} to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria.

On top of that, the timing of <b>fungicide</b> application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.The recommended standard for <b>fungicide</b> application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3-4 weeks.
