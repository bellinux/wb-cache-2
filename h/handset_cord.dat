50|$|The 4P4C {{connector}} is {{the standard}} modular connector used {{on both ends of}} telephone <b>handset</b> <b>cords,</b> and is therefore often called a handset connector.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid 1970s, AT&T {{introduced}} modular connectors for {{the line}} <b>cord</b> and <b>handset</b> <b>cords,</b> requiring the [...] RJ11 standard home telephone jack. Most customers who had Princess telephones {{were converted to}} modular jacks.|$|R
5000|$|Tendril perversion, often {{referred}} to in context as simply perversion, is a geometric phenomenon found in helical structures such as plant tendrils, in which a helical structure forms that {{is divided into two}} sections of opposite chirality, with a transition between the two in the middle. A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as telephone <b>handset</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{connection}} standard, such as RJ11, specifies {{not only}} the physical aspects of an electrical connector, but also the pinout, i.e. the assignment or function of each contact. Modular connectors are specified for the registered jack (RJ) series of connectors, {{as well as for}} Ethernet and other connectors, such as 4P4C (4 position, 4 contacts) modular connectors, the de facto standard on <b>handset</b> <b>cords,</b> often improperly referred to as RJ connectors.|$|R
5000|$|... early 70s The {{clear plastic}} button {{backplate}} with colored paper backing matching {{the color of}} the phone is replaced with an aluminum backplate on the round button Touch-Tone phones. Also at this time, the round <b>handset</b> <b>cords</b> using proprietary connectors are replaced with modern flat modular cords and jacks. On all Trimline phones, the screw cover above the dial changes from reading [...] "Bell System made by Western Electric" [...] to just [...] "Trimline" [...] with a bell logo {{to the left of the}} text.|$|R
5000|$|Cover {{names were}} common. In [...] "The Man Called Smart, Part 1," [...] {{a phone call}} is {{announced}} for an alias, and Max identifies himself as the person in question. Second and third calls come in, {{each with its own}} alias, the last of which is his own real name of Maxwell Smart, which he initially does not answer. Smart tells the skeptical gallery owner that those are his names as well, making it obvious to any spy that he is taking calls from fellow agents and informants. Smart then makes himself even more visible by tangling the <b>handset</b> <b>cords</b> of the three phones.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{brought the}} {{conversion}} to modular connector technology, replacing the hard-wired cords with cords terminated {{on both ends}} with 4P4C connectors for the <b>handset</b> <b>cord,</b> and 6P4C plugs for the line cord.|$|E
50|$|The phone also {{required}} a <b>handset</b> <b>cord</b> {{which had a}} long straight section as the connector to the base was located {{on the bottom of}} the phone, and not facing outward on the side.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} may be absent: Wired {{telephones}} {{may not have a}} separate base and handset. The defining characteristic of wireless telephones is {{that they do not have}} a <b>handset</b> <b>cord,</b> and the defining characteristic of mobile telephones is that they do not have a phone cord.|$|E

50|$|Physically, an {{electrical}} cable is an assembly consisting {{of one or more}} conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s). Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. Copper wires in a cable may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin but sometimes gold, silver or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA - as in telephone <b>handset</b> <b>cords).</b>|$|R
50|$|Tina Resch (born October 23, 1969) was {{a central}} figure {{in a series of}} {{incidents}} that came to be called the Columbus poltergeist case. In 1984, alleged telekinesis events at her Columbus, Ohio home drew significant news media interest. A series of color photographs taken by photojournalist Fred Shannon, and published by The Columbus Dispatch, were purported to show Resch sitting in an armchair with a telephone <b>handset</b> and phone <b>cord</b> flying in front of her, from left to right. Resch's story, and Shannon's photography, were featured on a 1993 episode of Unsolved Mysteries.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the line}} cord and <b>handset</b> <b>cord</b> were secured by {{screw-down}} terminals at both ends, with a strain relief anchor. Both cords had matching colors, but most color sets initially were produced with neutral, dark gray cords, with {{exception of the}} ivory and brown sets. Starting in 1955, all sets, except dark blue were equipped with color-matched cords as dyes and manufacturing methods became stable. By 1973, line cords were changed to a neutral gray color and from a round to a flat cross-section. As a customer option, telephone sets could be ordered for portability with four-prong plugs, but most sets were hard-wired to wall connection boxes. In the 1970s, much smaller modular connectors were introduced for {{both ends of the}} line cord as well as the <b>handset</b> <b>cord</b> to facilitate standard connection methods for third-party equipment within the FCC registration system.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{interactive}} response systems in some industries required additional signaling beyond the ten digits. In 1968, the # key and the * key {{were added to}} the push-button dial pad, and the 2500-type telephone entered production. The additional keys were located {{on either side of the}} '0' button to fill the matrix of 4-by-3 keys. These keys were initially unused by most customers, but would later be used for vertical service codes, and voice mail menu navigation. In 1974, when modular connectors were introduced, the 2500 telephone was fitted with modular connectors for the <b>handset</b> <b>cord</b> as well as the line cord, resulting in type designations suffixed with M, e.g. 2500DM. The 2500 is still commonly encountered today and it is still produced by several companies.|$|E
50|$|The Tele. 232 {{came out}} of the box fitted with a base plate {{containing}} a drawer, holding a personal directory card. The telephone could then be screwed directly onto the matching Bell set 26, making a true, but very heavy, telephone set, or screwed down onto the desk of a CCB (coin collecting box), in a Public Telephone Kiosk. In this form it was fitted with a modified dial, a more durable <b>handset</b> <b>cord,</b> and was re-numbered as the Tele. 242. There was one other variant. With modified internals and designed purely to be used in combination with a Bellset 39a or 44, this was the Tele. 248 in the guise of the Extension Plans 5 & 7. This type of telephone is often featured in British made period television dramas. Curiously, the telephone often rings despite not being fitted with any bell unit.|$|E
50|$|The phone {{consisted}} of a rotary dial, a handset cradle, switch hook, and a handset (sometimes called the receiver) wired to the base, and was constructed of a molded plastic housing covering a steel chassis. The user interface {{consisted of}} only the dial and switch hook buttons. No other components, switches, or controls were necessary, {{with the exception of}} a loudness control for the ringer, which was accessible on the bottom of the phone. The handset cradle was a molded part of the housing, formed of two U-shaped chairs which cradled the handle of the handset between the receiver and the transmitter cups. Each side of the cradle had a round plastic plunger positioned above a pair of levers connected in a spring-loaded yoke that operated the hook switch; pressing the plungers down ended the call and placed the phone on-hook. The plastic face of the dial under and surrounding the finger wheel was an integral part of the dial assembly and was exposed through a large circular opening in the housing. On the bottom, the flat steel plate of the chassis was exposed. The <b>handset</b> <b>cord</b> exited from the left side of the housing at the base, and the line cord emerged from the rear at the base.|$|E
