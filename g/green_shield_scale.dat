50|$|In Europe, {{the bright}} <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> bugs appear in May, having hibernated as imagos during the winter. They fatten {{for a month}} and then mate in June. The imago's {{coloration}} changes over the summer months from green to greenish browns even bronze , after which the life cycle will end. Mating is back-to-back. The female lays her eggs in hexagonal batches of 25 to 30, and a single female will lay three to four batches. After the eggs hatch, the <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> bug enter a larval stage (which is really their first nymphal stage) where, in general, they remain together in sibling communities. This is made possible by the excretion of an aggregation pheromone. In case of danger, another pheromone is released which causes dispersal. The larval stage is followed by four more nymphal stages as well as moulting between each one. The <b>green</b> <b>shield</b> bug displays different colouration during each nymphal stage, light brown, black or green-black, and in the final stage, the imago, is bright green with short wings. Usually the imago stage is reached in September, with hibernation occurring in November.|$|R
