5|$|The United States {{responded to}} the attack by {{increasing}} its <b>drone</b> attacks against militants in Pakistan. Nearly every day after the CIA facility was attacked, the U.S. military conducted <b>drone</b> strikes aimed at leaders of the Haqqani network in North Waziristan. In the week after the attack, the U.S. military conducted five <b>drone</b> strikes, an unusually high number. However, U.S. counter-terrorism officials cautioned against linking these attacks to the bombing. After reports of <b>drone</b> strikes, Pakistan {{said it would not}} support the attacks in its territory, as they were counterproductive.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator <b>drone</b> 16 {{nautical}} {{miles off the}} Iranian coast. The Iranian government has claimed that the <b>drone</b> violated its airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} <b>drone</b> with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched {{from the back of}} a M-21 carrier aircraft, a variant of the Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the <b>drone</b> was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct <b>drone</b> attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual <b>drone</b> operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended <b>drone</b> operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American <b>drone</b> attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
50|$|The Ryan Firebee was {{a series}} of target <b>drones</b> {{developed}} by the Ryan Aeronautical Company beginning in 1951. It {{was one of the first}} jet-propelled <b>drones,</b> and one of the most widely used target <b>drones</b> ever built.|$|R

5000|$|Sheila Chandra's album ABoneCroneDrone (1996) {{consists}} of minimalist vocal phrases over complex electronic <b>drones</b> combined with acoustic <b>drones.</b> She found melodies inherent within the harmonics of the <b>drones,</b> {{so that the}} music was incomplete without the listeners finding their own melodies arising from the <b>drones,</b> as she invited the listeners to be creators. She continued this approach onto her next album, This Sentence Is True (The Previous Sentence Is False). This work developed from her previous explorations based in Indian music using <b>drones</b> such as the tambura.|$|R
5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless <b>drone</b> aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a <b>drone</b> light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a <b>drone</b> or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} <b>drone</b> as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
40|$|My {{background}} paper for Special Rapporteur, Ben Emmerson, shows that using <b>drones</b> for targeted killing runs a heightened risk {{of civilian casualties}} because of the radically asymmetrical context in which <b>drones</b> operate. The heightened risk of civilian casualties together with the advanced capacity to avoid them places a very high ethical burden on those who would employ <b>drones</b> for targeted killing. Due to the circumstances and risks attendant to targeted killing with <b>drones,</b> armed forces using <b>drones</b> away from “hot battlefields” should commit to a zero-tolerance policy for civilian death...|$|R

Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in Libya {{at the end}} of his presidency.|$|E

In this episode, two of the crew are trapped on the Romulan <b>drone</b> ship while Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) on the Enterprise attempts to gain the co-operation of the Andorians and Tellarites in tracking down the <b>drone.</b> His plan is complicated when Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) challenges a Tellarite to a duel, causing Archer to step in. After he defeats Shran, the races work together and force the retreat of the Romulan vessel and the missing crewman are recovered.|$|E
50|$|Amazon Prime Air <b>drones</b> will be {{connected}} to the internet to allow for flight control management, and communication between <b>drones.</b> It has been reported by Brookings that Amazon's data collection usage from <b>drones</b> has not been disclosed.

50|$|While {{perfect for}} reconnaissance, {{the use of}} a mere radar van for command, track and control limit the combat ability of the <b>drones.</b> The team {{controlling}} the <b>drones</b> was limited to a single, stationary recovery area. In order to improve the range and recoverability of the <b>drones,</b> some C-130As were modified to carry the <b>drones</b> on pylons under the wings and were re-designated as GC-130, MC-130 or DC-130.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{excess power}} index (integrating body dry mass, thorax-to-body dry mass and wing surface area) was {{compared}} in <b>drones</b> of seven Asian Apis species. There are two statistically distinct groups of drones: <b>drones</b> of the dwarf honeybees form one class, all other Asian species {{belong to the}} second. <b>Drones</b> of dwarf honeybees have a 36 % ergonomic advantage in power availability and 20 % advantage in available excess power over all other <b>drones.</b> Comparisons of flight dimensions between conspecific workers and <b>drones</b> show a highly statistically significant sexual dimorphism for flight. Although <b>drones</b> of all seven tested species are always bigger than their workers their excess power index is some 15 % better. It is suggested that prowess of flight in <b>drones</b> {{is driven by the}} need to compete and mate with queens flying high in the air while worker bees forage nectar and pollen on flowers...|$|R
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg <b>drone.</b> Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the <b>drone</b> is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg <b>drone</b> as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|The <b>drone</b> attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of <b>drone</b> strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
