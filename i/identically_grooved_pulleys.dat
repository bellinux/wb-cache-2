Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R

But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.|$|R

Taking into account that for normal CVT operations the time the pin spends in contact with the <b>pulley</b> <b>groove</b> is of about 0. 01 s (traveling time), we show that rms surface roughness less than 0. 1 μm and squeezing load of about 1 kN acting on the pin, corresponding to values adopted in such systems, guarantee a fully lubricated EHL regime at the interface. We also show that during low-velocity CVT operations, the lubrication regime at the interface is determined by a succession of hydrodynamic and mixed lubrication stages in an order strictly related to the squeezing load history. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The work {{described}} {{here has been}} carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} tooth root cracking failure mode of timing belts. Previous work has demonstrated the close dependence of this on the tooth deflections of fully meshed teeth, generated by torque transmission, but has not considered the additional distortions generated in the partially meshed conditions at entry to and exit from a <b>pulley</b> <b>groove.</b> Approximate compatibility and constitutive equations are combined with a rigorous consideration of tooth equilibrium in partial meshing to show how bending moments are generated at both exit from a driven pulley and entry to a driving pulley. Experimentally determined belt lives correlate very well with a combined measure of fully meshed tooth strain and strain due to bending at entry or exit. The analysis also shows that this strain measure reduces with increasing belt tooth stiffness, confirming the importance of a high tooth stiffness for a long belt life. Tooth force variations through the partial meshing cycle have also been predicted and compared with measurements obtained from a special strain gauge instrumented pulley. A greater pulley rotation than is predicted is required for a belt tooth to seat in a <b>pulley</b> <b>groove.</b> There is room for improvement in the modelling...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{the present}} {{generation}} {{had discovered the}} ultimate force in nature most applicable {{to the service of}} men was a question for the scientist of the future to decide, but he thought they could claim the present to be an electrical age, as in pre-historic times there were ages of stone and bronze. The practical utility of the application of electricity to the propulsion of railway and tramway cars was first demonstrated at Berlin in 1879 by Siemens and Halske on an experimental line of 500 metres, {{in the form of an}} oval. The train consisted of a small electric locomotive and carriages, which had very small wheels, with two rows of seats running parallel to the rails. The success of this experiment led to other attempts of an exhibitional nature at Brussels, Dusseldorf, Frankfort and other places, and then electrical traction passed from the experimental to the commercial process of development. The Lichterfelde electric tram near Berlin was the first of its kind. The length was 1 1 / 2 miles, and the equipment in 1881 consisted of two motor cars, the motion being transmitted to the wheels by belts working on <b>grooved</b> <b>pulleys</b> outside the wheels. The prime source of power was a steam engine, with a Siemens motor and generator, but the installation differed in some respects from the Berlin line, the central rail not being used, but the one rail acting as a lead, and the other as a return for the current. Up to 1887 this line canied 100, 000 passengers yearly. These instances showed that the inception of electrical tramways took place in Europe, the principle being the generation of electricity by dynamo, and conveying the current through conductors connected by sliding contact with the cars while in motion. Modern electrical railways were now built chiefly on this principle, although America had far succeeded Europe in the improvement and perfecting of the system. The remainder of the paper consisted of a description of the various systems in vogue, after which he dealt with the "overhead system," which had most successfully operated commercially and practically. Many objections of an aesthetical nature had been urged against the overhead gearing, but they were more apparent than real, and he recommended such objectors to look to the telegraph cables so obtrusively conspicuous in big towns. It was superior to other systems of traction...|$|R

Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the cable, to reduce cable bending stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards to hold the cable in the <b>groove(s)</b> of the <b>pulley(s).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} the {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT are formed by pins that extend from one pulley half to the other pulley half and slide in the <b>grooves</b> of the <b>pulley</b> halves of the variator pulley. Here torque from the chain is transferred to the pins and then from the pins to the pulley halves. Since the pins are round and the grooves are curved, line contact between the pins and the grooves are used to transfer force from the pins to the grooves. The amount of force that can be transmitted between two parts depend on the contact area of the two parts. Since the contact areas between the pins and their grooves are very small, the amount of force that can be transmitted between them, and hence also the torque capacity of an iCVT, is limited.|$|R
5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a mating <b>groove</b> in the <b>pulley</b> (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.|$|R
5000|$|It is more {{efficient}} than the older multiple belt system and may consume less space in the engine compartment. By using a single, wider belt instead of multiple, thinner belts, the belt may be put under increased tension without stretching. Higher tension reduces slip, which increases belt life and mechanical efficiency. Reduced slip can allow the use of lower-ratio pulleys; this reduces the load on the engine, increasing fuel economy and available power. The tendency for V-belts to [...] "flip over" [...] in the <b>pulley</b> <b>groove</b> (at high RPM and/or when the belt stretches) is eliminated, and a serpentine belt is also much easier to maintain and replace, {{since there is no}} need to remove multiple belts in order to replace one of them, although newer adjustable-length V-belts ("link belts") can be put on without having to remove other belts, and their link design also allows a self-tensioning characteristic to reduce the risk of flipping over. Also since only one movable belt tensioner is required all of the peripheral components (alternator, A/C compressor, etc.) can simply be mounted to the engine without the need to swivel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{behaviour}} {{of power}} transmission systems {{have to be}} defined during preliminary design. Numerical simulations such as Finite Elements Analysis is the method used to design transmission components. This method aims to replace classical tests after experimental validation of computer software results. Sintered camshaft pulleys are designed using the same way. Design of this component can be optimised by simulating the quasi-static response of timing belt camshaft layout on a pulley under loading. The quasi-static belt response {{is related to the}} local behaviour of the transmission system while dynamic response of the whole camshaft layout is related to global behaviour. Because of the complex phenomena involved in such system and due to practical requirements of design office in terms of computer time, local and global analyses are performed separately, however, results from local analysis is used as input data for the second one. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the quasi-static behaviour of a timing belt setting on a pulley subjected to a torque. In order to take the environmental effects into account, the interaction between the belt and pulley is analysed with and without clearance. The analysis is performed using Abaqus Standard. The Finite Elements results show a significant influence of clearance on stresses distribution throughout the belt. When the belt is set up on pulley with clearance, reverse bending stresses are observed between the <b>groove</b> and teeth <b>pulley,</b> creating a polygonal effect. This effect generates a transmission error which may cause vibrations and then alter the behaviour of the belt during engine working. Without clearance between the two components, polygonal effect and transmission error are insignificant, and therefore dynamic excitations are smaller. Clearance is probably one of the major parameters governing the fatigue life of timing belt. Polygonal effect and quasi-static transmission error then constitute one of the input data for global dynamic simulations using a specific in-house...|$|R
