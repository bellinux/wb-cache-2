40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} assessing the effects of policing operations on tactical <b>deployment</b> <b>operated</b> by non-state actors. The theory advanced by this work, labelled SMORG theory, {{is first and foremost}} an attempt to move from fragmented to comprehensive knowledge. At the theoretical level, it provides policy makers and practitioners with a better understanding of policing instruments, and especially highlights the limits of coercion and deterrence when dealing with non-state actors. At the methodological level, it demonstrates how to scrutinise the protest space in its entirety, by providing an innovative set of tools to analyse the temporal and spatial distribution of forms of protests on diverse theaters. At the empirical level, it reveals the evolution of conventional, confrontational and violent forms of protest in South Lebanon, Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Israel, during the period 1982 to 2011; it further precisely assesses the effects of policing operations on tactical <b>deployment</b> <b>operated</b> by non-state actors on the same theaters...|$|R
