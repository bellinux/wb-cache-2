5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of <b>interleukin</b> 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interleukin</b> 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E

25|$|SS is {{associated}} with increased levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of IL-1RA, an <b>interleukin</b> 1 antagonist. This suggests that the disease begins with increased activity in the <b>interleukin</b> 1 system, followed by an autoregulatory up-regulation of IL-1RA to reduce the successful binding of <b>interleukin</b> 1 to its receptors. <b>Interleukin</b> 1 likely is the marker for fatigue, but increased IL-1RA is observed in the CSF and {{is associated}} with increased fatigue through cytokine-induced sickness behavior. SS, though, is characterized by decreased levels of IL-1ra in saliva, which could be responsible for mouth inflammation and dryness. Patients with secondary SS also often exhibit {{signs and symptoms of}} their primary rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add <b>interleukin</b> 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that <b>interleukin</b> 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with <b>interleukin</b> 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of <b>interleukin</b> 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E
25|$|People with SLE have intense {{polyclonal}} B-cell activation, with {{a population}} shift towards immature B cells.

T cells, which regulate B-cell responses and infiltrate target tissues, have defects in signaling, adhesion, co-stimulation, gene transcription, and alternative splicing. The cytokines B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLys), <b>interleukin</b> 6, <b>interleukin</b> 17, <b>interleukin</b> 18, type I interferons, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) {{are involved in the}} inflammatory process and are potential therapeutic targets.|$|E
40|$|CBA mouse spleen {{cells were}} {{subjected}} to hapten affinity fractionation on thin layers of fluorescein (FLU) -gelatin. This procedure yields 97 % B cells with varying FLU-binding avidities. One to 30 cells were placed in 10 -microliter microcultures without any filler or accessory cells. the T-independent antigen polymerized flagellin coupled to FLU (FLU-POL) was ineffective in stimulating these cells to clonal proliferation or antibody production when used alone. Unpurified preparations rich in <b>interleukins</b> also failed to stimulate the cells. When specific antigen, but not in irrelevant hapten-POL, was combined with the <b>interleukins,</b> clonal proliferation was stimulated and most clones produced anti-FLU antibody-forming cells. The frequency of antibody-forming clones was only slightly lower than that in a system using antigen plus filler cells. In the absence of added <b>interleukins,</b> the mitogens Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide plus dextran sulfate induced equivalent antibody production. However, a higher frequency of clonal proliferation was noted. Added <b>interleukins</b> did not aid these mitogen-driven responses.

40|$|Background: Clinical {{outcome in}} {{patients}} with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) depends on both primary and secondary brain injuries. Neuroinflammation is an important secondary mechanism, which occurs by releasing <b>interleukins</b> (ILs). Increased levels of ILs may affect clinical outcome following TBI. Objectives: This study aimed to determine {{the relationship between the}} serum levels of <b>interleukins</b> 6, 8 and 10 and clinical outcome {{in patients with}} severe TBI 6 months after injury. Patients and Methods: In a descriptive-analytical study, 44 patients with GCS ≤ 8 (Glasgow coma scale) and age ≥ 14 years were included. Their blood samples were collected at first 6 hours after injury. Clinical outcome was determined based on GOS (Glasgow Outcome Scale) at 6 months after head injury. Serum levels of <b>interleukins</b> 6, 8 and 10 were measured using the ELISA method. Spearman's rho, independent T-Test, and Mann-Whitney Test were used for data analysis. Results: Comparing the serum levels of <b>interleukins</b> in two groups with favorable and unfavorable clinical outcomes showed that the mean serum levels of <b>interleukins</b> 6 and 8 in group with favorable outcome was 85. 2 ± 51. 6 and 52. 2 ± 31. 9, respectively lower than those of group with unfavorable outcome with 162. 3 ± 141. 1 and 173. 6 ± 257. 3 (P < 0. 03) and (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Increased serum levels of <b>interleukins</b> 6 and 8 as a predictive marker might be associated with unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with severe TBI...|$|R

25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T cell mediated autoimmune reaction (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-1 alpha, <b>interleukin</b> 6, and <b>interleukin</b> 8. This autoimmune, T cell mediated, process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E

25|$|Ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of lymphocytes, {{especially}} T cells. This {{complex of}} ciclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which, under normal circumstances, {{is responsible for}} activating the transcription of <b>interleukin</b> 2. In T-cells, activation of the T-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc), which moves to {{the nucleus of the}} T-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for IL-2 and related cytokines. Ciclosporin prevents the dephosphorylation of NF-AT by binding to cyclophilin. It also inhibits lymphokine production and <b>interleukin</b> release and, therefore, leads to a reduced function of effector T-cells. It does not affect cytostatic activity.|$|E

25|$|One {{model for}} the {{mechanism}} of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. An immunological protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBP–LPS complex then binds to the CD14 receptor of a nearby macrophage. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokine factors, such as <b>interleukin</b> 1 (IL-1), <b>interleukin</b> 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway. The highly toxic metabolism-boosting supplement 2,4-Dinitrophenol induces high body temperature via the inhibition of ATP production by mitochondria, resulting in impairment of cellular respiration.

25|$|In current research, the {{significant}} relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied.
