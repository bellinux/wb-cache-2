40|$|Mixed <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> have {{potential}} agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over specialized <b>farming</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. A mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> at regional level {{is characterized by}} intensive cooperation between two or more specialized farms, each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such a mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a specialized arable farm, a specialized dairy farm and both combined into a mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system,</b> exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> was assessed in a qualitative way. In the mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system,</b> labour income per ha was 25 % higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The remaining 30 % resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both specialized farms {{and that of the}} mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the mixed <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> could not be found.

40|$|<b>Farming</b> <b>systems</b> {{research}} was introduced into many international and national agricultural research institutes in lower income {{countries in the}} 1970 s and 1980 s {{with the purpose of}} improving the relevance of research for small-scale farmers. This review outlines the origin, context, goals, principles and process of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research in these countries, and aims to enable agricultural professionals to assess the relevance and value of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research to their work in particular situations in Australia and overseas. The key elements of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research include a holistic approach, orientation towards the needs of defined target groups, high levels of farmer participation and hence co-learning by farmers and specialists. There is guidance by facilitators, continuous evaluation and linkage to policy makers. The goal of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research is to improve the well-being of farmers through the development of <b>farming</b> <b>systems.</b> It involves application of methods from various disciplines, first to define the constraints and opportunities for development and then to overcome these in a research process involving farmers, with specialists and policy makers. A generalised <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research procedure and various research activities are described. Initially in lower income countries, a fairly standard <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research procedure was used, but <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research has evolved to encompass a range of activities commonly regarded as the realm of agricultural extension or rural development. Basic science, applied science and <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research are compared in terms of the roles and relationships of the people involved in the research process. The implications of selecting <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research as a model for rural research and development are discussed. Achieving adequate levels of farmer participation can be a major issue in <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research so {{it is important that the}} principal notions of participation are understood. Success of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research in Australia will depend on developing innovative ways of achieving high levels of participation. Current trends in the philosophy, practice and funding of agricultural research and extension in Australia make it timely to consider the wider adoption of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research principles and practices. <b>Farming</b> <b>systems</b> research could provide a valuable philosophical and practical basis for the trend towards greater participation by researchers will end-users and extension practitioners in agricultural development programs. However, it seems unwise to adhere strictly to any one particular model of research and development from other places: <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research concepts are being combined successfully with those from other model, such as systems learning and computer modelling, to suit the needs of particular situations. Implications of a wider adoption of <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> research in Australia for agricultural research and development organisations and professional bodies include, the establishment of multidisciplinary teams with shared goals, and the sourcing of funding for periods long enough to achieve outcomes. There is also a need for training in systems concepts and facilitation, for reputable channels of publication of the results of <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> research and for greater recognition of participatory activities as valid forms of agricultural research...|$|R

We found that compared with conventional <b>farming</b> <b>systems,</b> diversified <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional <b>farming</b> <b>systems,</b> but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the <b>farming</b> <b>system.</b> Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation to and {{mitigation}} {{of climate}} change in Australian agriculture has included research at the plant, animal, and soil level; the <b>farming</b> <b>system</b> level; and the community and landscape level. This paper focuses on the <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> level at which many of the impacts of a changing climate will be felt. This is also the level {{where much of the}} activity relating to adaptation and mitigation can usefully be analysed and at which existing adaptive capacity provides a critical platform for further efforts. In this paper, we use a framework of nested hierarchies introduced by J. Passioura four decades ago to highlight the need for research, development and extension (RDE) on climate change at the <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> level to build on more fundamental soil, plant, and animal sciences and to link into higher themes of rural sociology and landscape science. The many questions asked by those managing <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> can be categorised under four broad headings: (1) climate projections at a local scale, (2) impacts of climate projections on existing <b>farming</b> <b>systems,</b> (3) adaptation options, and (4) risks and opportunities from policies to reduce emissions. These questions are used as a framework to identify emerging issues for RDE in Australian <b>farming</b> <b>systems,</b> including the complex balance in on-farm strategies between adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. Climate is recognised as one of the defining features of different <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> in Australia. It follows that if the climate changes, <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> will have to shift, adapt, or be transformed into a different land use. Given that Australian <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> have been adaptive in the past, we address the question {{of the extent to which}} research on adaptation to climate change in <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> is different or additional to research on <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> in a variable climate...|$|R
40|$|A project {{proposal}} whose {{aim is to}} promote more appropriate resource management on smallholder crop-livestock farms in East Africa is described. Prototypes of mixed <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> will be developed to characterise <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> according to their management objectives. These prototypes will then be used to map improvements of the <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> by combining prototyping and simulation modelling. Scenarios will be explored to assess natural resource management interventions that promote sustainability of these prototype-farming systmes. If funded and implemented, the project will result in smallholder prototypes of mixed <b>farming</b> <b>systems</b> in Coastal, Central and Western Kenya, and should provide information concerning viable management options that enhance the productivity and sustainability of smallholders' <b>farming</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
