40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the design of electronic circuitry for accurately locking the average frequency of a klystron tube to the resonant frequency of a high-Q microwave cavity which contains air and an unknown amount of water vapor. The reflex klystron is frequency modulated with a 10 KHz sine wave which sweeps the klystron frequency over a narrow range {{in the vicinity of}} the cavity resonant frequency. Modulating signal and crystal detector signal are compared in a switching detector circuit which accumulates an error signal. Feedback transmission of the error signal to the repeller electrode of the klystron is accomplished by a phototransistor optical coupling. Integrated circuits are used for signal and error amplification. The results show that sensitivity of the control circuit is approximately 1. 11 MHz per <b>dc</b> <b>volt</b> of error signal. Frequency bandwidth in which the serve-loop circuit will lock onto the resonant frequency of the cavity is approximately 5 MHz at a center frequency of 11 GHz. The system described requires less equipment and complex circuitry than other methods presently in use. Advisor:Allen R. Ediso...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{radial movement}} of injected Rb caused by diffusion {{is likely to}} be limited. In addition, the low moisture content at white zone between sapwood and heartwood will hamper the diffusion of injected Rb to heartwood. The example of white zone hampering the dye diffusion in Japanese cedar is found in the study by Ohashi et al. [16]. They soaked freshly cut log of living Japanese cedar in 0.5 % acid fuchsin aqueous solution overnight, and observed that the dye ascent mainly inner most sapwood. Since transpiration stream no longer flowed in the log, the movement of the dye was considered to be caused by diffusion. Color photos (e.g., Plate  1) in the report of Ohashi et al. [16] showed the dye did not go into the white zone. Other evidence indicating the white zone as a barrier of radial movement of minerals is found in an experiment studying transverse migration of minerals in green wood. In the experiment under a direct current (DC) potential by Minato et al. [14], they showed the distribution changes of trace elements in wood blocks, each of which was containing sapwood and heartwood of Japanese cedar. When they set the heartwood side as cathode under a 400  V of DC potential, K concentration in the portion nearest the cathode increased with time. However, the results (Fig.  3 a in the article) indicated that K migration from sapwood to heartwood within the initial 30  min seemed to be less than expected. It was 2  h later in their experiment applying 400 <b>DC</b> <b>volt</b> to specimens that most of K in sapwood migrated to heartwood. The results indicate that even under a 400 <b>DC</b> <b>volt</b> K migration across the sapwood–heartwood boundary is still difficult. In our Rb injection experiment, there is no such driving force that promotes Rb migration to heartwood. Simple diffusion along the concentration gradient between sapwood and heartwood caused by Rb injection cannot be the driving force, because Rb content in the heartwood continued increasing even after Rb content in the sapwood became lower. Thus, we consider the increase of Rb in heartwood as active transport in Japanese cedar stem, and ray seems to be the only pathway connecting sapwood and heartwood. In fact, one photo explaining the longitudinal pathway of dye movement (Plate  9 : Ohashi et al. [16]) also clearly shows that only ray is stained with dye in the sapwood, although the authors did not referred to that.|$|E

A transbrake is a part of a racing automatic transmission used in drag racing, and are not found in manual transmissions.
