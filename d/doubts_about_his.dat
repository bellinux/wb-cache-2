5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction, and <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> career, triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper has abstained from alcohol since 2004, remarking that it would have destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve, but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E

5|$|The author credits {{multiple}} sources for introducing <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> conditions while living at Gold Base. He writes that {{he listened to}} The John and Ken Show on KFI, and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him to think more critically during his time at the compound. He says that viewing Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{follows the}} {{conflicts}} of the Varner family after ambitious drifter Ben Quick (Newman) arrives in their small Mississippi town. Will Varner (Orson Welles), the family's patriarch, has <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> son, Jody (Anthony Franciosa), and sees Ben as {{a better choice}} to inherit his position. Will therefore tries to push Ben and his daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) into marriage.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{choice of}} a four-man team for the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> fitness.|$|E

6000|$|... "I detest him," [...] said Mrs. Carr to herself, [...] "at least, I think I do; but how neatly he put me down! There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> being a gentleman, though insufferably conceited." ...|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden {{pulled himself}} together. There was no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> companion's earnestness, {{but it was}} the earnestness of an {{unbalanced}} mind. Language so exaggerated as his was out of keeping with the times and the place.|$|R
5|$|The Brahmin {{community}} in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by Priya Bapat) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses.|$|E
5|$|The rider {{considered}} {{most likely}} to challenge Contador for the general classification was Richie Porte (Sky). Porte had already achieved nine race victories in 2015, including the overall victories in Paris–Nice, the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro del Trentino. Porte {{was expected to be}} particularly strong in the individual time trial, {{as well as in the}} mountains. Porte had not shown consistent form in a Grand Tour in recent years, however, and there were <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> ability to maintain his form over a three-week race.|$|E
5|$|Zack recovers to find Aerith {{tending to}} him. After they {{spend some time}} together, Zack returns to SOLDIER {{headquarters}} which is under attack by Genesis. On his way, Zack allies with Angeal, who has developed <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> and Genesis' actions. As Angeal, Zack and Sephiroth protect the headquarters, Angeal confronts Genesis, but both disappear. Zack is subsequently ordered to investigate Modeoheim, where Genesis has been spotted. En route, Zack meets Shinra infantryman Cloud, and they become friends. Near Modeoheim, Zack encounters and defeats Genesis, who appears to commit suicide by throwing himself {{into the depths of}} a reactor. Zack travels on to Modeoheim and finds both Angeal and Hollander. Angeal summons and fuses with his own clones, and mutates into a monster, forcing Zack to kill him. Before he dies, Angeal gives Zack his Buster Sword, telling him to protect his honor.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Mackay studied {{physics at}} the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford before {{returning}} to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1933 to 1940 he was headmaster of Cranbrook School, Sydney. He remained in the Militia between the wars, and was a major general {{by the time the}} Second World War broke out. He was selected to command the 6th Division in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. Any <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as General Officer Commanding Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the Second Army. During 1943 he twice commanded New Guinea Force in the fighting in the New Guinea campaign. His active service ended with his appointment as High Commissioner to India in November 1943.|$|E
5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> future as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> testimony.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{said the}} lawyer; [...] "there's no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> falsehood. He's {{one of those}} fellows for whom nothing is too dirty.

25|$|For Presley's {{return in}} March 1960, Parker had {{arranged}} for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.

50|$|Booker {{was born}} in 1925 on a {{plantation}} between the Mississippi communities of Moorhead and Sunflower, the son of Lucius Booker.

50|$|Max Born {{agreed with}} Einstein and stated both speed and {{direction}} of light change in a gravity field first published 1923 in English, 1920 in German. Born expressed the magnitude of light speed as the square root of (−g44/g11) gravity components in general relativity to leave no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> intent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; poor! I {{hardly know}} what you call poor. But {{we all know that}} he is a distressed man. I suppose he has a good income, and a little ready money would, perhaps, set him up; but there's no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> being over head and ears in debt, I suppose." ...|$|R
25|$|However, the {{pressure}} on the new ministry from advocates of Catholic Emancipation was too great and an Emancipation Bill was passed the next year. The government threatened to resign if the king opposed the bill; he finally relented. Peel reversed himself and took charge of passing Catholic Emancipation. However his action caused many Tories to have <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> sincerity; they never fully trusted him again.|$|E

25|$|The {{youthful}} Muralitharan {{went from}} strength to strength, playing {{a major part}} in Sri Lanka's back-to-back Test victories against England and New Zealand in 1992–93. It {{was at this point}} in his career that he struck a close bond with his leader, mentor and one time business partner, the authoritative captain Arjuna Ranatunga. This relationship formed the bedrock of his success and meant that there were few <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> status as the team's sole wicket-taker. Ranatunga was thoroughly convinced that Muralitharan's precocious talent would signal a new era in Sri Lanka's short Test history.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory VII's {{earliest}} pontifical letters clearly acknowledge this fact, {{and thus}} helped defuse any <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> election as immensely popular. On 22 May 1073, the Feast of Pentecost, he received ordination as a priest, {{and he was}} consecrated a bishop and enthroned as [...] pope on 29 June (the Feast of St. Peter's Chair).|$|R
50|$|Because Louise's {{mother was}} known to had several lovers, the king always <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> paternity, and for this he never {{recognized}} Louise and kept her away from court, treating her poorly {{at the time of}} her marriage.

50|$|Iamblichus of Trier {{also known}} as Jamblichus or Jamblychus was a 5th-century bishop of Trier from 475 / 476. He is attested in an {{inscription}} in Chalon-sur-Saône found.
