25|$|If the {{sequence}} of the nucleotides in a gene changes, {{the sequence}} of the amino acids in the protein it produces may also change—if part of a gene is deleted, the protein produced is shorter and may not work any more. This {{is the reason why}} different alleles of a gene can have different effects in an organism. As an example, hair color depends on how much of a dark substance called melanin is put into the hair as it grows. If a person has a normal set of the genes involved in making melanin, they make all the proteins needed and they grow dark hair. However, if the alleles for a particular protein have different sequences and produce proteins that can't <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> no melanin is produced and the person has white skin and hair (albinism).|$|E

500|$|Bush's {{method of}} {{management}} at the OSRD was to direct overall policy, while delegating supervision of divisions to qualified colleagues and letting them <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> without interference. He attempted to interpret {{the mandate of the}} OSRD as narrowly as possible to avoid overtaxing his office and to prevent duplicating the efforts of other agencies. Bush would often ask: [...] "Will it help to win a war; this war?" [...] Other challenges involved obtaining adequate funds from the president and Congress and determining apportionment of research among government, academic, and industrial facilities. His most difficult problems, and also greatest successes, were keeping the confidence of the military, which distrusted the ability of civilians to observe security regulations and devise practical solutions, and opposing conscription of young scientists into the armed forces. This became especially difficult as the army's manpower crisis really began to bite in 1944. In all, the OSRD requested deferments for some 9,725 employees of OSRD contractors, of which all but 63 were granted. In his obituary, The New York Times described Bush as [...] "a master craftsman at steering around obstacles, whether they were technical or political or bull-headed generals and admirals." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the passage}} of time, studies of human rights {{violations}} in Peru have discovered a close relationship between Garcia and the forces within Peru who promote impunity for human rights violators. [...] Garcia was involved in colonizing the bench by placing inside the judiciary judges who would be sympathetic to perpetrators of human rights violations. [...] Additionally, Garcia was supportive of efforts to punish judges who handed down indictments of perpetrators. [...] Garcia himself was in the presidency during many gross {{violations of human rights}} and he has been quite hostile to human rights organizations and to judicial actors who seek justice for victims of human rights violations. [...] During his presidency Garcia sought to tilt the legal playing field in favor of the military and against victims. [...] He also tried to make life difficult for NGOs seeking to help victims. [...] For example, he offered extensive resources to defendants and military officers while creating new laws that would make it difficult for human rights NGOs to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> receive necessary resources, and pursue the advance of judicial action that attempted to bring human rights justice.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{was put in}} a state shelter by the {{authorities}} after her mother and grandmother died in 1982. Lucas convinced her to abscond and they lived on the road, eventually traveling to California, where an employer's wife asked them to work for her infirm mother, 82-year-old Kate Rich, of Ringgold, Texas. Rich's family turned Lucas and Powell out, accusing them of failing to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and writing checks on her account. While hitchhiking they were {{picked up by the}} [...] minister of a Stoneburg, Texas religious commune called [...] "The House of Prayer". Believing Lucas and the 15-year-old Powell were a married couple, he found Lucas a job as a roofer while allowing the couple to stay in a small apartment on the commune. Powell had become argumentative and homesick for Florida, and Lucas said she left at a Bowie, Texas truck stop. According to some of his later accounts Lucas murdered Powell and then Rich. In addition to confessing, Lucas led the police to remains said to be Powell and Rich, although forensic evidence alone was inconclusive and the coroner stopped short of positively identifying either remains. As with most of his alleged crimes, Lucas later denied involvement, but the consensus is he did murder Powell and Rich.|$|E

2500|$|First, {{the meaning}} of a [...] "trade dispute" [...] under TULRCA 1992 section 244 is {{confined}} to mean a dispute [...] "between workers and their employer" [...] and must mainly relate to employment terms. In BBC v Hearn Lord Denning MR granted an injunction against a strike by BBC staff to stop broadcast of the 1977 FA Cup Final to apartheid South Africa. He reasoned that this was a political dispute, not a [...] "trade dispute", unless the union was requesting [...] "putting a clause in the contract" [...] to not do such work. Strikes against government legislation (rather than an employer), or privatisation, or outsourcing before it happens, have been held unlawful. However, at the least, any dispute over the terms or conditions on which workers <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> will allow protection. Second, TULRCA 1992 section 224 prevents collective action against someone who is [...] "not the employer party to the dispute". So called [...] "secondary action" [...] was lawful from the Trade Union Act 1871 until 1927, and again from 1946 till 1980. This makes the definition of [...] "employer" [...] relevant, particularly where a trade dispute involves a company group. A worker's written statement of the contract may purport to say that the only [...] "employer" [...] is a subsidiary, although the parent company carries out the employer's function of ultimately setting the contractual terms and conditions. There are a limited number of outright prohibitions on strike action, but in accordance with ILO Convention 87 this is only for workplaces that involve the truly essential functions of the state (for armed forces, police, and prison officers), and only when impartial arbitration is used as an alternative.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a person}} works at night, {{he or she}} may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is {{classified}} as [...] "hazardous". Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive hours of rest in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6 hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the concept of a two-day [...] "weekend" [...] arose in the earlier 20th century, while France more recently implemented the right to a 35-hour workweek in 2000. Under the Directive, this EU maximum is 48 hours. The maximum does not apply to anyone who is self-employed or who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the ECJ emphasised that the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers [...] "opt out" [...] of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. However, the obvious criticism has been made that the opt-out makes the right fictitious, because in jobs with a [...] "long hours culture", people are socially compelled to do what everyone else does. If the worker has not [...] "opted out", then the 48-hour week is not a rigid maximum, but is taken as an average over 17 weeks. Analogous to the minimum wage rules, [...] "on call" [...] time (where people must make themselves available, but are not necessarily active) is regarded as working time if the workers are bound to remain awake and close to their workplace. This created a significant problem for junior doctors, where in all European countries the culture has typically been that very long hours are expected. The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same [...] "opt out" [...] derogation as the UK, though limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, though it has taken a [...] "light touch" [...] approach to enforcement.|$|E
