5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of riders, the coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. The riders in the first category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. The riders in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} that it was necessary with an indoor speed skating rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 Winter Olympics, but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics, had opted for the outdoor L'anneau <b>de</b> <b>vitesse.</b> In its bid, the speed skating events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E

5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs <b>de</b> <b>vitesse</b> and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors {{had not been so}} enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned that it had a commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the normal {{diffusion}} of an ultrasonic plane wave by cylinders imbedded in water shows resonances which are the natural modes of vibration. When a natural mode of an elastic target is excited, the energy which is stored during the forced excitation is radiated {{after the end of}} the forced excitation. The observation of backscattered spectra obtained by the "Resonance Isolation and Identification Method" (RIIM) fi •om an aluminium cylinder shows supplementary resonances. The directivity pattern of the transducer is the cause of these supplementary resonances. The behaviour of these resonances is analogous to the resonances of plates. This leads us to study the natural modes of the cylinder. Ail the resonances which are experimentally detected may be considered as normal modes of the target.

40|$|We give an {{estimate}} of an upper bound of information propagation speed {{as a function of}} a targeted transport capacity density. The propagation speed depends on the density of simultaneous emitters and the node mobility model. We assume that nodes move according to an independent random walk. This work makes the junction between the work of Gupta and Kumar~(2000) and Grossglauser and Tse~(2002). We show that the information speed tends to zero when the transport capacity tends to infinity. We compare our result to the performance of an actual protocol based on angle determination.

Automatic meshing is performed by simple clicking in die contour representing the body to be deformed. Displacement and pressure boundary conditions are available in a graphical way. The software is especially adapted to the study of impacts but quasi-static tests may also be simulated. Propagation of waves, glide bands and cracks have been visualized. An application to Charpy impact tests on polycarbonate is shown. Crack nucleation at the elastic-plastic interface has been obtained as may be expected from experiment. Crack propagation speed was found to be one quarter of the shear wave speed. Computed fracture energy is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data...|$|R
