40|$|Verse 1] Old Ephraham from Alabam Was just a {{good for}} nothing lazy man; No kind of work to him was interesting, Though Eph’ {{was always on the}} job suggesting, But folks confess, His laziness was never known to stand a certain test; It seems that melody And Eph’ cannot agree, Just start a band and he gets busy. [Chorus] Ev’ry time a band starts playing, he just looks all around, all around, all around, Then his body starts aswaying and he bows to the ground, to the ground, to the ground. He stands there awhile alistening, Soon is lips they start awhistleing, Then he’s gone, gone, gone, like a <b>flash,</b> with a <b>dash,</b> and a crash, Oh! Makes no diff’rence where that band is anywhere, he’ll be there, he’ll be there, he’ll be there. If there’s people all around him ev’rywhere, he don’t care, he don’t care, he don’t care. Other times he’s doggone lazy, But it seems that music sets him crazy, And the folks all call him Brass band Ephraham Jones. [Verse 2] A county fair was held out there, All kinds of bands arrived from ev’rywhere; Their playing {{certainly}} kept Eph’ram busy, He chased those bands around till he felt dizzy; They made him mad, But he was glad, Cause music simply couldn’t make him sad, Those bands have left the town, But Eph’ don’t wear a frown, He follows them around, he’s happy. [Chorus...|$|R
