5|$|In {{addition}} to its officers and crew, the Beagle carried several , passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage {{were going to be}} returned to Tierra del Fuego on the Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E

5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of US pop forms has been strong {{since the end}} of World War II. Lavish Broadway-show numbers, big bands, rock and roll, and hip hop continue to be popular. Latin music, especially Brazilian bossa nova, is also popular, and the Puerto Rican genre of reggaeton is rapidly becoming a mainstream form of dance music. It is now not uncommon for modern Italian pop artists such as Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero or Andrea Bocelli to release new songs in English or Spanish in addition to, or instead of, Italian. Thus, musical revues, which are standard fare on current Italian television, can easily <b>go,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single evening, from a big-band number with dancers to an Elvis impersonator to a current pop singer doing a rendition of a Puccini aria.|$|E
5|$|The 2000–01 NHL {{season was}} Daniel's {{first season with}} the Canucks. His debut was the team's {{first game of the}} {{campaign}} on 5 October 2000, a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Daniel and Henrik became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Daniel scored his first career NHL goal against goaltender Dan Cloutier of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Henrik, the goal tied the game at 4–4 with 1:13 minutes left to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5–4 regulation win. On 30 November 2000, he suffered a shoulder injury, sidelining him for four games. During his recovery, he was reprimanded by Canucks Head Coach Marc Crawford, who told him that playing through pain is part of being in the NHL. Later in the season, he missed an additional three games due to a back injury, shortening his rookie season to 75 games. He became the first rookie in 2000–01 to reach 20 goals when he scored on 21 March 2001, in a 1–1 tie against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Finishing the campaign with that goal total, he tied for second among League rookies in scoring with Shane Willis, behind Brad Richards. He also had 14 assists for 34 points in total. Making his Stanley Cup playoff debut against the Colorado Avalanche, Daniel recorded an assist in the opening game of the first-round series, a 5–4 loss for the Canucks. He added his first NHL playoff goal later in the series as the Canucks were eliminated in four-straight games. He and Henrik played primarily on the Canucks' third line. Daniel received one third-place vote from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, finishing eighth in award balloting overall.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, disaffected evangelicals {{left the}} Church Missionary Society over moves {{to broaden the}} society's {{theological}} boundaries and established the Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society (now known as Crosslinks). Soon, there were BCMS missionaries in Africa, Burma, and among the Inuit peoples. In 1925, what would become Trinity College in Bristol was established by the BCMS to train missionaries. Trinity, then known as Tyndale Hall, would maintain a conservative position, while other evangelical colleges like Ridley Hall would <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more theologically open direction.|$|E

25|$|Batoo is {{a modern}} Korean variant. The name stems from a {{combination}} of the Korean words baduk and juntoo (“battle”). It is played entirely in cyberspace, and differs from standard <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways, most noticeably {{in the way in which}} certain areas of the board are worth different points values. The other principal difference is that both players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. Batoo became a short-lived fad among young people in Korea around 2011.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1903 rowing season, the Athletic Council {{replaced}} Sweetland with James A. Ten Eyck as rowing coach. Sweetland {{had demanded}} a higher salary {{to coach the}} rowing team. When his demands were not met he resigned from all athletic work at Syracuse. The rowing team threaten a revolt but no major action was taken. Even though they replaced him at rowing coach some in the council tried to retain him as football coach for the 1904 season. They were unsuccessful, with the full council deciding to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction. In the end Sweetland coached football for three years at Syracuse with a combined record of 20–5-2.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2008, Marshall and Jones {{left the}} band to pursue other careers. Charlie Griffiths, the guitarist {{for the band}} Linear Sphere and Anchorhead became a {{full-time}} member of the band. Griffiths parted ways with Linear Sphere {{because he wanted to}} <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction musically. Mexican keyboardist Diego Tejeida auditioned and eventually joined the band in late 2008 as well. As they began to tour more, even opening a few UK shows for King's X, Sensory Records recognized them and offered them a record deal. They began recording for their debut album, Aquarius, soon after, and it was released in March 2010.|$|E

25|$|As for WABC, {{which has}} aired Jeopardy! at 7:00 ever since, {{initially}} the same lead-out issues plagued the station. Hollywood Squares saw its ratings decline and was {{dropped by the}} station after its second season in favor of bringing back Entertainment Tonight, after two seasons on WWOR; Squares moved to WPIX, where it remained {{until the end of}} its run in 1989. WABC finally found a permanent partner for Jeopardy! in 1990 when it took over for WCBS as the New York home for Wheel of Fortune. Although it had been a ratings winner for the station since WCBS picked up Wheel, the station decided it wanted to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction with its pre-prime time programming (for instance, WCBS picked up Hard Copy to serve as the lead in for Wheel in 1989 and eventually paired it with Entertainment Tonight, once it became available in the fall of 1990).|$|E

25|$|Unperturbed by Piquet's mind games, Mansell went on {{to record}} five Grand Prix wins in 1986 and also {{played a part in}} one of the closest {{finishes}} in Formula One history, finishing second to Ayrton Senna in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez by a mere 0.014 seconds (Mansell later jokingly said they should give himself and Senna 7½ points each). The 1986 season was led mostly by Mansell in championship points, and it went down to the wire in Adelaide, Australia for the Australian Grand Prix with Prost, Piquet and Mansell all still in contention for the title. The equation was simple, Prost and Piquet needed to win and have Mansell finish no higher than fourth. After aiming for a third-place finish which would guarantee him the title, Mansell would narrowly miss out on winning it after his left-rear tyre exploded in spectacular fashion on the main straight with only 19 laps of the race to <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2012 interview for Sky Sports Legends of F1 Mansell revealed that, had he hit the wall rather than wrestling the car safely to a halt in the run-off area {{at the end of the}} straight, the stewards would most likely have red flagged the race. As the race was over two thirds distance, he would have kept his position and won his first F1 world title. Instead Mansell ended the season as runner-up to Alain Prost. His efforts in 1986 led to his being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E
