40|$|The <b>displacement</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of spatial}} {{linkages}} {{has been the}} subject of a number of recent investigations, using a variety of mathematical approaches. Algebraic solutions have been developed principally, in cases in which the number of links, n, is less than or equal to 4. When n> 4, the complexity of the <b>displacement</b> <b>analysis</b> appears to in-crease by one or more orders of magnitude. In this paper we describe a method, which we call the geometric-configuration method, which we have used when n> 4. The method is illustrated with respect to the algebraic <b>displacement</b> <b>analysis</b> of a five-link spatial mechanism, which includes the Tracta joint as a special case. The Tracta joint is a spatial linkage of symmetrical proportions functioning as a constant-velocity universal joint for nonpar allel, intersecting shafts (Myard, 1933). It has four turning or revolute pairs (R) and one plane pair (E), which is located symmetrically with respect to the input and output shafts. The generalization of this linkage, which we call the generalized Tracta coupling, is the R-R-E-R-R spatial linkage with general proportions. The <b>displacement</b> <b>analysis</b> of the general mechanism, for which we know of no previous solution, has been derived.

The BP network replaces the time-consuming finite element method, thus enhancing {{the efficiency of the}} analysis. The GA is used as an optimization method, whose global search strategy can effectively improve the reliability of the analysis, thereby, making the back-analyzed results independent of the initial values. Application of this methodology is illustrated with a numerical example.

Shrinkage causes local displacements of cavity walls, with possible occurrence of micro-cracks in the enamel, dentin and/or material itself.

This paper presents a new approach to <b>displacement</b> <b>analysis</b> using the reduced Gröbner basis form of a system of equations under degree lexicographic (dlex) term ordering of its monomials and Sylvester’s Dialytic elimination method. Using the Gröbner-Sylvester hybrid approach, a finitely solvable system of equations F is transformed into its reduced Gröbner basis G using dlex term ordering. Next, using the entire or a subset of the set of generators in G, the Sylvester’s matrix is assembled. The vanishing of the resultant, given as the determinant of Sylvester’s matrix, yields the necessary condition for polynomials in G (as well as F) to have a common factor.

The existence of a displacements plane attached to the tool edge point is revealed. This plane proves to be inclined compared to the machines tool axes. We establish that the tool tip point describes an ellipse. This ellipse is very small and can be considered as a small straight line segment for the stable cutting process (without vibrations). In unstable mode (with vibrations) the ellipse of displacements is really more visible. A difference in phase occurs between the tool tip displacements on the radial direction and on the cutting one. The feed motion direction and the cutting one are almost in phase. The values of the long and small ellipse axes (and their ratio) shows that these sizes are increasing with the feed rate value.
