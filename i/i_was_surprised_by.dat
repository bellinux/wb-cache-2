500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{how people}} reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how {{something}} {{made me feel}} a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E
500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch {{things up a}} bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance like... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> how much I enjoyed the performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
5000|$|Rick L. Blalock from Terror Hook.com {{awarded the}} film {{a score of}} 2 / 10 stating, [...] "Well, I can't say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> how much <b>I</b> didn't like this film - I kind of {{expected}} it but was hoping for the best. This film to be honest is one slasher film I found myself bored with rather quickly".|$|R
5000|$|In September 2007, Maurizio Prato, at {{that time}} chairman, told {{senators}} in Rome [...] "Alitalia is in a comatose state, {{it is in the}} intensive care unit". Further he said: [...] "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the general refusal to accept reality and by the fact that a company in this state does not have the possibility, even though it is listed on the stock market, to make autonomous decisions even if this is needed for its survival".|$|R
6000|$|Aloof {{as the two}} {{officers}} are from the men, Captain West is still more aloof from his officers. I have not seen him address a further word to Mr. Mellaire than [...] "Good morning" [...] on the poop. As for Mr. Pike, who eats {{three times a day}} with him, scarcely any more conversation obtains between them. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> what seems the very conspicuous awe with which Mr. Pike seems to regard his commander.|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> Lawrence's attitude. He was so seldom vehement about anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was half-past eleven. Armadale had gone. I {{had put on}} my dressing-gown, and {{had just}} sat down to arrange my hair for the night, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{a knock at the}} door, and Midwinter came in.|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of my return, before it was {{possible}} for me to receive my promised letter, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a visit from Mr. Ablewhite the elder, and was informed that Mr. Godfrey had got his dismissal--AND HAD ACCEPTED IT--that very day.|$|E
6000|$|Being already no {{stranger}} to the general rapidity of my aunt's evolutions, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the suddenness of the proposal, and said: 'Yes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Earlier tonight Arvid {{informed}} me {{that we would not}} be continuing to work on the book together. I wish that I could say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this, but I'm not unfortunately. ... I know that sounds like the old 'creative differences' line that gets thrown out so much, but now I can see why it get used so often. It is very literally the only 'clean' and accurate way to express something that is not 'clean,' but rather very complex.|$|R
6000|$|First as to [...] "Mr. Arle." [...] I have {{constantly}} {{heard it}} spoken of with great approval, and I think it {{a book of}} considerable merit. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to tell you that}} I see no evidence of inexperience in it, that would not <b>be</b> true. <b>I</b> think a little more stir and action to be desired also; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> your being despondent about it, for I assure you that I had supposed it (always remembering that it is your first novel) to have met with a very good reception.|$|R
6000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1860, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> finding how large a number of insects were caught by {{the leaves of the}} common sun-dew (Drosera rotundifolia) on a heath in Sussex. I had heard that insects were thus caught, but knew nothing further on the subject.* I ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was just}} {{thinking}} how busy drink and the devil were {{at that very moment}} in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a sudden lurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} spoken to me in confidence, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> his doing so. I said I should respect his confidence, of course, and said no more on the {{delicate}} subject. We had but a little way to walk, and I was soon in his mother's company. He presented me, shook hands with me, and left us two (as he said) to business.|$|E
5000|$|A 38-year-old {{man and a}} 28-year-old woman {{were arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of murder, but were later released without charge following questioning. Following {{the release of the}} pair Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill said that [...] "While I thank those members of the community who have come forward with information <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> how few people have contacted us. Normally in cases of this scale more information is passed to the police...I strongly suspect that there is someone out there in the community who knows more than we are being told." ...|$|R
5000|$|He is very {{critical}} towards {{the media and}} the lack of professionalism of certain journalists. [...] "every day, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> the mass of information on health and worrying aspect and opposed to the dedication of Charte de l'environnement, under its current form, the precautionary principle in the Constitution of 4 October 1958, thus writing: [...] "The major fault of this precautionary principle, its original sin is a sin of pride. It makes believe that one could protect oneself from everything because one could always detect the cause of a potential catastrophe." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ivanov criticized both teams, {{reportedly}} saying, [...] "They {{are known}} for time wasting and hitting from behind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unpleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> seeing such things from the Dutch. More so, they were the instigators." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Erymanth {{had told}} me that his sister would soon be at home, and in September <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a call from Dermot. [...] "Yes, I'm at Arked," [...] he said, [...] "Killy Marey is full of Dublin workmen. My uncle has {{undertaken}} to make it habitable for me, like an old brick, and, in the meantime, there's not a room fit to smoke or sleep in, so I'm come home like a dutiful son." ...|$|E
6000|$|Judge of {{this for}} me, and do as you please; anyway, I will try to write to her again; my last {{was some kind of}} scrawl that I could not see for crying. This came upon me, remember, with terrible suddenness; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this death; and it is fifteen or sixteen years since first I saw the {{handsome}} face in the Spec. I made sure, besides, to have died first. Love to you, your wife, and her sisters.--Ever yours, dear boy, ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this stage}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a sudden burst of passion on her part. She stood up, her face {{flushing}} red, and solemnly declared that if ever a public-house was opened in that village, {{and if the}} men took to spending their evenings in it, her husband with them, she would not endure such a condition of things--she wondered that so many women endured it--but would take her little ones and go away to earn her own living under some other roof! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{very much}} <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the inquiry; but could give no {{information}} on this point.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{especially}} <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact}} that I started to work four days after signing a contract. Although I've {{always been interested in}} movies and the theater, I'd never seen any actual shooting, and it was all very exciting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose she}} thought {{you must know}} it, since <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> her {{beginning}} about it to me, for when Emma first mentioned it to me, Lady Elizabeth seemed vexed, and begged me never to hint at it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Judge of {{this for}} me, and do as you please; anyway, I will try to write to her again; my last {{was some kind of}} scrawl that I could not see for crying. This came upon me, remember, with terrible suddenness; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this death; and it is fifteen or sixteen years since first I saw the {{handsome}} face in the SPEC. I made sure, besides, to have died first. Love to you, your wife, and her sisters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tuesday--Sat up {{late last}} night, reading my new book. My {{favorite}} poets, novelists, and historians {{have failed to}} interest me. I devoured the Trials with breathless delight; beginning of course with the murder in which I felt a family interest. Prepared to find my grandfather a ruffian, I confess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the discovery that {{he was also a}} fool. The officers of justice had no merit in tracing the crime to him; his own stupidity delivered him into their hands. I read the evidence twice over, and put myself in his position, and saw the means plainly by which he might have set discovery at defiance.|$|E
60|$|We were {{admitted}} to the pavilion by Clara, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the completeness and security of the defences. A barricade of great strength, and yet easy to displace, supported the door against any violence from without; and the shutters of the dining-room, into which I was led directly, and which was feebly illuminated by a lamp, were even more elaborately fortified. The panels were strengthened by bars and cross-bars; and these, in their turn, were kept in position by a system of braces and struts, some abutting on the floor, some on the roof, and others, in fine, against the opposite wall of the apartment. It was at once a solid and well-designed piece of carpentry; and I did not seek to conceal my admiration.|$|E
60|$|It was a direct, {{almost a}} blunt question. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> but <b>I</b> {{answered}} her without hesitation.|$|R
60|$|On {{coming in}} from sea one has {{to pick up the}} {{conditions}} of an utterly unrelated existence. Every little event at first has the peculiar emphasis of novelty. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> that early caller; but {{there was no reason for}} my steward to look so particularly foolish.|$|R
2500|$|The ex-governor and {{his family}} learned of the {{indictment}} while they were vacationing in Florida, near Disney World. Through his publicist, the ex-governor stated, [...] "I'm saddened and hurt, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the indictment. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> innocent. <b>I</b> now will fight in the courts to clear my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{another time}} I {{was going to}} ride to the Atlantic House, {{about a mile from}} my boarding-place. I left all secure, as I supposed, at home. While {{gathering}} moss on the walls there, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a little green humming-bird flying familiarly right towards my face and humming above my head. I called out, [...] "Here is Hum's very brother." [...] But, on returning home, I saw that the door of the room was open, and Hum was gone. Now certainly we gave him up for lost. I sat down to painting, and in a few minutes in flew Hum, and settled {{on the edge of my}} tumbler in a social, confidential way, which seemed to say, [...] "Oh, you've got back then." [...] After taking his usual drink of sugar and water, he began to fly about the ceiling as usual, and we gladly shut him in.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{reflecting}} on things of this sort, when, {{looking through the}} cracks of my prison, to ascertain the state of matters without, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> {{the appearance of a}} man on horseback, who was entering the clearing on its eastern side, seemingly quite at home in his course, though he was travelling without a foot-path to aid him. As this man had a pair of the common saddle-bags of the day on his horse, I at first took him for one of those practitioners of the healing art who are constantly met with in the new settlements, winding their way through stumps, logs, morasses and forests, the ministers of good or evil, I shall not pretend to say which. Ordinarily, families like that of Thousandacres do their own [...] "doctoring"; but a case might occur that demanded the wisdom of the licensed leech; and I had just decided in my own mind that this must be one, when, as the stranger drew nearer, to my surprise I saw that it was no other than my late agent, Mr. Jason Newcome, and the moral and physical factotum of Ravensnest! ...|$|E
6000|$|... [122] Mr. Skene in his Reminiscences says:--"The {{family had}} been at Abbotsford, and it had long been their {{practice}} the day they came to town to take a family dinner at my house, which had accordingly been complied with upon the present occasion, and I never had seen Sir Walter in better spirits or more agreeable. The fatal intimation of his bankruptcy, however, awaited him at home, and next morning early <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> a verbal message to come to {{him as soon as}} I had got up. Fearful that he had got a fresh attack of the complaint from which he had now for some years been free, or that he had been involved in some quarrel, I went to see him by seven o'clock, and found him already by candle-light seated at his writing-table, surrounded by papers which he was examining, holding out his hand to me as I entered, he said, [...] "Skene, this is the hand of a beggar. Constable has failed, and I am ruined de fond en comble. It's a hard blow, but I must just bear up; the only thing which wrings me is poor Charlotte and the bairns."" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{suspect that}} those who have read some of my other works will <b>be</b> a little <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this one. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this one.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> this explanation, and a {{good deal}} {{relieved}} to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of replying, I said, [...] "If it be as you state, then why did you take me from my island, and why do you not now take me back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tis because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so gratified,' {{said the}} old man. 'I always get all in a tremble when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> a beloved relation.' ...|$|R
