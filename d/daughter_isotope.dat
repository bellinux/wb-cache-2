5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of americium {{are known}} with mass numbers from 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; {{both of them}} can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> 239Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.|$|E
50|$|Monazite geochronology {{studies the}} ratio of parent <b>isotopes</b> to <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> (isotopic ratio), and calculates how much time has passed since <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> start accumulating.|$|R
50|$|In the {{radioactive}} processes, the three unstable parent isotopes decay into their respective stable <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> of Pb. Each following a decay chain consisting of alpha and beta decays, parent isotopes 238U, 235U and 232Th, decay {{into a series}} of intermediate <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes,</b> and finally lead to stable isotopes, 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb, respectively. Each decay chain has a unique half-life, which means the <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> are generated at different rates.|$|R
50|$|The decay {{processes}} can be simplified as {{the following}} equations, which omit all the intermediate <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes.</b>|$|R
500|$|... 210Po is {{an alpha}} emitter {{that has a}} {{half-life}} of 138.4days; it decays directly to its stable <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope,</b> 206Pb. A milligram (5curies) of 210Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5grams of 226Ra. A few curies (1curie equals 37gigabecquerels, 1Ci = 37GBq) of 210Po emit a blue glow which is caused by ionisation of the surrounding air.|$|E
500|$|Polonium-210 has a {{half-life}} of 138 {{days and}} decays to the stable <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> of lead, 206Pb. Therefore, the source {{is reduced to}} about one sixteenth of its original radioactivity about 18 months after production. By measuring the proportion of polonium and lead in a sample, one can establish the production date of polonium. The analysis of impurities in the polonium (a kind of [...] "finger print") allows identification of the place of production. The isotope used in killing of Litvinenko has been traced by a British theoretical physics professor Norman Dombey: ...|$|E
50|$|Decay stages are {{referred}} to by their relationship to previous or subsequent stages. A parent isotope is one that undergoes decay to form a <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope.</b> One {{example of this is}} uranium (atomic number 92) decaying into thorium (atomic number 90). The <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> may be stable or it may decay to form a <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> of its own. The daughter of a <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> is sometimes called a granddaughter isotope.|$|E
50|$|Radiometric dating {{is based}} on the known and {{constant}} rate of decay of radioactive isotopes into their radiogenic <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes.</b> Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications due to the type of atoms present in the mineral or other material and its approximate age. For example, techniques based on isotopes with half lives in the thousands of years, such as Carbon-14, cannot be used to date materials that have ages on the order of billions of years, as the detectable amounts of the radioactive atoms and their decayed <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> will be too small to measure within the uncertainty of the instruments.|$|R
50|$|The above {{equation}} {{makes use}} {{of information on the}} composition of parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature. This is well-established for most isotopic systems. However, construction of an isochron does not require information on the original compositions, using merely the present ratios of the parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> to a standard isotope. Plotting an isochron is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.|$|R
5000|$|All methods {{based on}} the {{radioactive}} decay belong to this category. The principle {{at the base of}} radiometric dating is that natural unstable isotopes, called 'parent isotopes', decay to some isotope which is instead stable, called the 'daughter isotope'. Under the assumptions that (1) the initial amount of parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> can be estimated, and (2) after the geologic material formed, parent and <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> did not escape the system, the age of the material can be obtained from the measurement of isotope concentrations, through the laws of radioactive decay.Methods of this kind are usually identified with the names of the parent/daughter elements.

50|$|Uranium {{tailings}} contain {{over a dozen}} radioactive nuclides, {{which are}} the primary hazard posed by the tailings. The {{most important of these}} are thorium-230, radium-226, radon-222 (radon gas) and the <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> of radon decay, including polonium-210.|$|R

50|$|The {{relative}} abundances {{of different}} isotopes are {{then used to}} describe the chemical fractionation of different isotopes, travel in different reservoirs of non-radiogenic isotopes, and age or origins of solar system objects by the presence of radiogenic <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the alpha}} decay steps, the zircon crystal {{experiences}} radiation damage, {{associated with each}} alpha decay. This damage is most concentrated around the parent isotope (U and Th), expelling the <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> (Pb) from its original position in the zircon lattice.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum-99 is {{produced}} commercially by intense neutron-bombardment {{of a highly}} purified uranium-235 target, followed rapidly by extraction.

50|$|Potassium-calcium dating, {{abbreviated}} K-Ca dating, is a radiometric dating {{method used}} in geochronology. It {{is based upon}} measuring the ratio of a parent isotope of potassium (40K) to a <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> of calcium (40Ca). This form of radioactive decay is accomplished through beta decay.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Uranium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in many nuclear power plants, and the neutron-induced fission reactions produce many decay products. Some of these are of interest from an efficiency or safety point of view. For this reason, {{it is important to}} quantitatively and qualitatively know these nuclides. The objective {{of this study is to}} experimentally determine these properties through neutron activation and gamma ray spectroscopy. Using a germanium semiconductor detector, gamma rays emitted from fission <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> produced from neutron irradiation of a uranium sample are measured. The resulting spectra are analyzed, proving the existence of fission <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> in the specimen. The data also provides experimental estimations of initial half-life of these isotopes...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} stable [...] "daughter" [...] Pb {{isotopes}} {{that result from}} the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in nature; they are 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb. 204Pb is the only non-radiogenic lead isotope, therefore {{is not one of}} the <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes.</b> These <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> are the final decay products of U and Th radioactive decay chains beginning from 238U, 235U and 232Th respectively. With the progress of time, the final decay product accumulates as the parent isotope decays at a constant rate. This shifts the ratio of radiogenic Pb versus non-radiogenic 204Pb (207Pb/204Pb or 206Pb/204Pb) in favor of radiogenic 207Pb or 206Pb. This can be expressed by the following decay equations: ...|$|R
5|$|Above-ground {{nuclear tests}} by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a {{significant}} amount of fallout from uranium <b>daughter</b> <b>isotopes</b> around the world. Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents.|$|R
5000|$|In nuclear physics, a {{decay product}} (also {{known as a}} {{daughter}} product, <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> or daughter nuclide) is the remaining nuclide left over from radioactive decay.

5000|$|... 228Th is an isotope {{of thorium}} with 138 neutrons. It was once named Radiothorium, due to its {{occurrence}} in the disintegration chain of thorium-232. It has a half-life of 1.9116 years. It undergoes alpha decay to 224Ra. Occasionally it decays by the unusual route of cluster decay, emitting a nucleus of 20O and producing stable 208Pb. It is a <b>daughter</b> <b>isotope</b> of 232U.|$|E
50|$|The element rhenium {{is always}} present in {{molybdenite}} {{as a substitute}} for molybdenum, usually in the parts per million (ppm) range, but often up to 1-2%. High rhenium content results in a structural variety detectable by X-ray diffraction techniques. Molybdenite ores are essentially the only source for rhenium.
