The analysis involves investigating compounds called congeners that give the beverage a distinctive appearance, aroma, and flavour, not including water and ethanol. The theory of discovering one’s drinking habits has been investigated since the late 1970s, predominantly in Germany, for [...] "hip-flask" [...] defence type cases (after-drinking). Alcohol congener analysis can {{play a crucial role in}} these cases where the driver is apprehended some time after a motor vehicle incident who, when returning a positive alcohol reading then claim that this is due to drinking an alcoholic beverage only after the incident. This traditional methodology for congener analysis has focused solely on the detection of <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> congeners that are found in all alcoholic beverages. By comparing the ratios of a set standard of congeners, the ingested alcoholic beverage type is proposed.|$|E
40|$|Corn stover is one {{of several}} {{feedstocks}} being considered as a biofuel. Although corn stalks currently are not harvested routinely, the huge amount of biomass produced annually makes corn a potential commercial biofuel. Removal of crop residue from the field needs to balance against preventing soil erosion, maintaining soil organic matter levels, and preserving or enhancing productivity. After corn stover is fermented to produce ethanol, the remaining residue is about 70 % lignin. Lignin decomposes slowly, which can help stabilize soil structure. One use of <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> would be as a soil amendment, thereby minimizing some of the negative impacts of stover removal on soil structure. Laboratory studies show that by-product of stover fermentation increased microbial biomass and soluble C by 20 % compared to soil without amendment. In the Langhei soil, humic acid concentration (r 2 = 0. 84, p< 0. 0001) and aggregate stability (r 2 = 0. 35, p< 0. 001) increased linearly with increased <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> concentration. Thus, laboratory results suggest that this <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-product</b> has potential as a soil amendment. Returning by-product to the field may slow the loss of soil organic matter caused by removing corn stover. Careful management of stover removal (avoiding eroded or erosion prone areas) and selective placement of the by-product could contribute to a sustainable use of corn stover for ethanol production.

In the case of Pichia pastoris, information of its biomass composition at macromolecular and elemental level is scarce particularly when different environmental conditions, such as oxygen availability or, genetic backgrounds (e. g. recombinant protein production vs. non production conditions) are compared. Results: P. pastoris cells growing in carbon-limited chemostat cultures under different oxygenation conditions (% O 2 in the bioreactor inlet gas: 21 %, 11 % and 8 %, corresponding to normoxic, oxygen-limiting and hypoxic conditions, respectively), as well as under recombinant protein (antibody fragment, Fab) producing and non-producing conditions, were analyzed from different points of view. On the one hand, the macromolecular and elemental composition of the biomass was measured using different techniques at the different experimental conditions and proper reconciliation techniques were applied for gross error detection of the measured substrates and products conversion rates. On the other hand, fermentation data was analyzed applying elemental mass balances. This allowed detecting a previously missed by-product secreted under hypoxic conditions, identified as arabinitol (aka. arabitol).

BFR was obtained from a microbrewery, dried and ground, resulting in approximately 1. 0 x 10 (10) S. cerevisiae cells g(- 1) BFR. Binding assays consisted of suspending BFR (100 mg) in 10 mL of buffer solution (pH 3. 0 or 6. 5) spiked with AFB(1), ZEA, OTA or DON (2. 0 mu g ml(- 1) of each mycotoxin), incubation (60 min, 25 degrees C) followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. BFR had higher binding capacity for ZEA (75. 1 % and 77. 5 % at pH 3. 0 and 6. 5, respectively), when compared with AFB(1), OTA and DON (less than 60 % and 40 % at pH 3. 0 and 6. 5, respectively). BFR also produced linear isotherms for ZEA at both pH values, hence indicating a potential application of industrial <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> containing yeast cells in reducing the bioavailability of ZEA in contaminated feedstuffs. However, in vivo studies are required to prove its efficacy in livestock and poultry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} expedient and reliable methods to isolate cyclosporin synthetase for in vitro biosynthesis of cyclosporins. We have examined enzyme purification strategies suited to large-scale processing and present a chromatographic sequence {{that serves as}} a pilot model for industrial scale preparation of cyclosporin synthetase from cyclosporin producing fungi. A chromatographic sequence consisting of ammonium sulfate precipitation → gel filtration → hydrophobic interaction chromatography → anion exchange chromatography, yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous cyclosporin synthetase preparation (Coomassie G- 250 brilliant blue staining). Furthermore, a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system was developed for the isolation of active cyclosporin synthetase enzyme from crude extracts of cyclosporin producing fungi. The environmental factors affecting enzyme stability and the continuity of the in vitro cyclosporin biosynthetic reaction-temperature, pH, and substrate depletion were assessed and manageable conditions have been defined for sustainable cyclosporin biosynthesis with enzyme isolates. Cyclosporin synthetase exhibited an optimal temperature range of 24 – 29 °C and a pH optimum of 7. 6. The native enzyme displayed a pI of 5. 7, as determined by isoelectric focusing. The industrial implementation of an in vitro biosynthetic approach could potentially prove useful for the production of important therapeutic cyclosporins which occur as only minor <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products.</b> <br /...|$|R
40|$|Despite some {{blockbuster}} G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) drugs, only a {{small fraction}} (∼ 15 %) of the more than 390 nonodorant GPCRs have been successfully targeted by the pharmaceutical industry. One way that this issue might be addressed is via translation of recent deorphanization programs that have opened the prospect of extending the reach of new medicine design to novel receptor types with potential therapeutic value. Prominent among these receptors are those that respond to short-chain free fatty acids of carbon chain length 2 – 6. These receptors, FFA 2 (GPR 43) and FFA 3 (GPR 41), are each predominantly activated by the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate, and butyrate, ligands that originate largely as <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> of anaerobic bacteria in the gut. However, the presence of FFA 2 and FFA 3 on pancreatic β-cells, FFA 3 on neurons, and FFA 2 on leukocytes and adipocytes means that the biologic role of these receptors likely extends beyond the widely accepted role of regulating peptide hormone release from enteroendocrine cells in the gut. Here, we review the physiologic roles of FFA 2 and FFA 3, the recent development and use of receptor-selective pharmacological tool compounds and genetic models available to study these receptors, and present evidence of the potential therapeutic value of targeting this emerging receptor pair...|$|R
40|$|The dha regulon in Klebsiella pneumoniae {{enables the}} {{organism}} to grow anaerobically on glycerol and produce 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD). Escherichia coli, {{which does not}} have a dha system, is unable to grow anaerobically on glycerol without an exogenous electron acceptor and does not produce 1, 3 -PD. A genomic library of K. pneumoniae ATCC 25955 constructed in E. coli AG 1 was enriched for the ability to grow anaerobically on glycerol and dihydroxyacetone and was screened for the production of 1, 3 -PD. The cosmid pTC 1 (42. 5 kb total with an 18. 2 -kb major insert) was isolated from a 1, 3 -PD-producing strain of E. coli and found to possess enzymatic activities associated with four genes of the dha regulon: glycerol dehydratase (dhaB), 1, 3 -PD oxidoreductase (dhaT), glycerol dehydrogenase (dhaD), and dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhaK). All four activities were inducible by the presence of glycerol. When E. coli AG 1 /pTC 1 was grown on complex medium plus glycerol, the yield of 1, 3 -PD from glycerol was 0. 46 mol/mol. The major <b>fermentation</b> <b>by-products</b> were formate, acetate, and D-lactate. 1, 3 -PD is an intermediate in organic synthesis and polymer production. The 1, 3 -PD fermentation provides a useful model system for studying the interaction of a biochemical pathway in a foreign host and for developing strategies for metabolic pathway engineering...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to apply the enzymatic {{treatment}} and fermentation by Pediococcus acidilactici BaltBio 01 strain for industrial cereal by-products conversion to food/feed bioproducts with high amount of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB). LAB propagated in potato media and spray-dried remained viable during 12 months (7. 0 log 10 cfu/g) of storage and was used as a starter for cereal <b>by-products</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The changes of microbial profile, biogenic amines (BAs), mycotoxins, lactic acid (Lþ/D), lignans and alkylresorcinols (ARs) contents in fermented cereal by-product were analysed. Cereal by-products enzymatic hydrolysis before fermentation allows to obtain a higher count of LAB during fermentation. Fermentation with P. acidilactici reduce mycotoxins content in fermented cereal by-products. According to our results, P. acidilactici multiplied in potato juice could be used for cereal <b>by-products</b> <b>fermentation,</b> as a potential source to produce safer food/feed bioproduct with high amount of probiotic LAB for industrial production...|$|R
