30|$|The term {{vitrinite}} commonly {{refers to}} reflectance measurements of vitrinite Ro (%) {{for the reason}} that optical properties <b>of</b> vitrinite <b>Maceral</b> <b>group</b> change more consistently during the advancement of their grade as compared to those <b>of</b> the other <b>Macerals.</b> A more recent definition explains that vitrinite is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Macerals</b> with distinct optical and chemical properties varying with relative effect of temperature and/or time. The vitrinite reflectance [Ro (%)] measurements are commonly used for determining the maturity of rocks. The maturity levels based on vitrinite reflectance [Ro (%)] and Tmax (C) and the occurrence different Maceral types, i.e., fluorescent amorphous organic matter (OM), exinite and alginite (Tables  3, 4) demonstrate that source rock maturity in both Sembar and Chiltan formation falls in the oil and gas generation zone to cracking of oil to gas condensate zone.|$|R
30|$|Inertinite {{macerals}} {{have the}} same precursors as vitrinite <b>macerals</b> and many <b>of</b> them pass through the same stages of humification except that, before reaching depositional base level below the groundwater table, they are subjected to a period of intensive desiccation and varying degrees of oxidation including partial burning of the accumulated vegetal matter (Gould and Shibaoka 1980). The results are coal constituents which possess relatively high O/C ratios and high reflectance in incident light microscopy because they are rich in aromatic carbon. Most inertinite macerals are relatively brittle and hard, which in incident light microscopy is shown by their tendency to develop polishing relief. Inertinite includes a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>maceral</b> which are characterized by their white to yellowish white colour and high reflectance.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study an attempt {{has been made to}} carry out the {{detailed}} petrographic characterization of the Karharbari coals of Talcher coalfield and to reconstruct the paleoenvironment conditions of coal formation using macerals and microlithtotypes as a tool. For these purposes a large number of samples were collected following the pillar sampling method and were subjected to detailed petrographic study. The petrographic observation shows that these coals are vitrinite rich followed by the liptinite and inertinite <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>macerals.</b> On microlithotype scale, these coals shows the dominance of the vitrite followed by clarite, vitrinertite and inertite. The concentration of liptite, clarodurite, duroclarite and vitrinertoliptite are insignificant. The vitrinite reflectance ranks the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to high volatile ‘B’ bituminous. Coal petrography based depositional models suggest peat accumulation in forested telmatic swamp. Moreover, during the time of their evolution, there were alternate phases of oxic and anoxic moor conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|R
30|$|Fusinite is {{characterized}} by a well preserved cellular structure where cell lumens may be open or occupied by mineral matter (carbonate, pyrite and clay) (Fig.  2 f). Bogen and sieve structures have also been observed in fusinite. Under white incident light the colour of fusinite is white to yellowish white with high relief and very high reflectance. Both pyrofusinite and degrado fusinite have been recorded. After the fusinite, next dominating <b>maceral</b> <b>of</b> the inertinite <b>group</b> is semifusinite (Fig.  2 e). The cell structure of semifusinite is not so well preserved {{as in the case of}} fusinite. Its colour lies between light grey to white. In some places, transition from collotelinite to semifusinite has also been observed during the petrographic study. Figure  2 e shows the sharp boundary between collotelinite and semifusinite. Marionette has also been observed in these cells. It occurs as rounded to oval bodies. (Figure  2 g). The colour is white and reflectance is high close to this fusninte in the same coal. Micrinite has been observed in these coals and it occurs in the form of lenses. It shows white colour and high reflectance. Secretinite has also been recorded in these coals (Fig.  2 c). Inertodetrinite is observed only in these coals and it appears to have been derived from crushing of fusinite and semifusinite (Fig.  2 c, g, h). The quantitative distribution <b>of</b> inertinite <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>macerals</b> <b>of</b> the Karharbari coals is given in the Table  4 and Fig.  4.|$|R
30|$|The lignites of the Barmer basin are chiefly {{composed}} <b>of</b> the huminite <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>macerals</b> {{while the}} liptinite and inertinite group macerals occur in low concentrations. There {{is not much}} variation in the maceral composition from Seam-I to Seam-VIII. Huminite (85.9  vol%, mean of all the seams on mmf basis) is comprised mainly of telohuminite and detrohuminite. Telohuminite is mainly contributed by ulminite-A (24.4  %) and ulminite-B (20.9  %). Detrohuminite consists of densinite (32.2  %) and attrinite (7.6  %). Gelohuminite is present in very small amounts. Among the liptinites (8.8  vol%, mean of all the seams on mmf basis), resinite (5 – 40  µm) (5  %) sporinite (1.1  %), cutinite (0.5  %) are common. Few sections show megaspores and megacuticles. Few patches of suberinite are seen, showing clearly developed cortex cells. Among the inertinites (5.3  vol%, mean of all the seams on mmf basis), fusinite (2.2  %) with bogen structure was observed especially in Seam-IV and VIII. Seam-I and Seam-VI from the Giral mine have shown good fungal bodies. Mineral matter (11.6  vol%, mean of all the seams) occurs in moderate concentration in all the seams of the Giral mine.|$|R
30|$|The present paper {{entails the}} results of the {{investigations}} carried out on the lignite deposits of Kachchh Basin. The lignite samples were drawn from five lignite seams from Panandhro lignite field (Seam-I to -V) and eight lignite seams (Seam-I to -VIII) from the Matanomadh lignite field which are currently operational. The petrographic analysis of the lignites indicates a dominance <b>of</b> huminite <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>macerals</b> which is mainly contributed by ulminite-A, ulminite-B, attrinite, densinite, and phlobaphinite. Liptinite (chiefly sporinite, cutinite, resinite, and liptodetrinite) and inertinite (chiefly fusinite, funginite, and inertodetrinite) groups occur in subordinated amount. The mineral matter occurs in moderate concentration. Though sulfur content is high in these lignites, there is no fixed trend of variation of sulfur from bottom seam to top seam. The investigation reveals a flooded forest swamp having high rate of degradation. However, there were a few drier periods indicated by relatively more inertinite macerals. The petrography-based models indicate that the Kachchh lignites of Gujarat evolved in coastal marshy setting under transgressive phase. However, there were few intermittent fluvial activities giving rise to supratidal flood plain. This {{led to the formation of}} the associated carbonaceous shales in the basin.|$|R
30|$|Petrographically, {{vitrinite}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>macerals</b> dominate {{followed by}} inertinite and relatively in lesser concentration are <b>macerals</b> <b>of</b> the liptinite <b>group.</b> Among the vitrinites, collotelinite record the highest followed by vitrodetrinite and collodetrinite. In the studied coals, inertinite {{also has a}} major presence indicating dry episodes {{in the development of}} the peat. Among the microlithotypevitrite followed by inertite, clarite and durite are major entities in the coals. The rank of the coal as per the volatile matter is between sub-bituminous ‘B’ and sub-bituminous ‘A’. Hydrocarbon generation potential is low as indicated by rock–eval pyrolysis. Based on HI and OI plots and elemental H/C and O/C ratio, the investigated coals have been characterized as kerogen Type III, suggestive of dominantly terrestrial and lacustrine organic matter. The peat development on basis of microlithotype composition suggest their evolution in limno-telmatic zones having floral inputs characteristic of forest moor with intermittent hydrological conditions. The Gelification Index and Tissue Preservation Index are suggestive of terrestrial origin with high tree density. Further, moderately high GI and exceedingly high telovitrinite based TPI along with high ash content are indicative of their origin in intermittent dry forested swamps. The Ground Water Index suggests that these coals have evolved in bogs under ombrotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index values are indicative of preponderance of herbaceous plants in the formation of the coals. The plots on a depositional model given by Smyth (1979) indicate their deposition under fluvio-lacustrine control with the development of upper deltaic and lower deltaic conditions near the fresh water lacustrines.|$|R

For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the microlithotype analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used.

For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination <b>of</b> <b>macerals</b> was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation.
