50|$|In the Wellington Region, the Torlesse Composite Terrane is {{composed}} of two subterranes, the Rakaia Terrane (late Triassic to early Jurassic, 230-180 Ma), {{to the west of}} the Ruahine Ranges, and the Pahau Terrane (late Jurassic to early Cretaceous, 180-100 Ma), to the east. Major faults such as the Wellington Fault and Wairarapa Fault lie close to the boundary between the terranes. At the boundary between these two terranes, is the Esk <b>Head</b> <b>Belt,</b> a 20 km wide melange of rocks, broken and deformed by earthquakes along the fault lines near the boundary.|$|E
50|$|All {{basement}} rocks {{beneath the}} Canterbury Region {{belong to the}} Torlesse Composite (Rakaia and Pahau) Terrane. They are largely composed of greywacke (hardened sandstone and mudstone) that accumulated in a deep marine environment, and were accreted to the Gondwana continent before the Tasman Sea opened up in late Cretaceous times (80 Ma). They outcrop in the Southern Alps and the foothills. The Rakaia Terrane rocks, of Permian to late Triassic age (300-200 Ma), occur south of Rangiora. The Pahau Terrane rocks, of late Jurassic to early Cretaceous age (160-100 Ma), occur to the north, and are probably derived from the Rakaia Terrane. At the boundary between these two terranes is the Esk <b>Head</b> <b>Belt,</b> an 11 km wide melange of broken and deformed rocks.|$|E

40|$|The {{geophysical}} technique {{known as}} Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves, or MASW (Park et al., 1999) {{is a relatively}} new seismic characterisation method which utilises Rayleigh waves propagation. With MASW, the frequency dependent, planar travelling Rayleigh waves are created by a seismic source and then measured by an array of geophone receivers. The recorded data is used to image characteristics of the subsurface. This thesis explains how MASW was used as a geotechnical investigation tool on windfarms in the lower North Island, New Zealand, to determine the stiffness of the subsurface at each wind turbine site. Shear‐wave velocity (VS) profiles at each site were determined through the processing of the MASW data, which were then used to determine physical properties of the underlying, weathered greywacke. The primary research site, the Te Rere Hau Windfarm in the Tararua Ranges of the North Island, is situated within the Esk <b>Head</b> <b>Belt</b> of Torlesse greywacke (Lee & Begg, 2002). Due to the high level of tectonic activity in the area, along with the high rates of weathering, the greywacke material onsite is highly fractured and weathering grades vary significantly, both vertically and laterally. MASW was performed to characterise the physical properties at each turbine site through the weathering profile. The final dataset included 1 ‐dimensional MASW shear‐wave evaluations from 100 turbine sites. In addition, Poisson’s ratio and density values were characterised through the weathering profile for the weathered greywacke. During the geotechnical foundation design at the Te Rere Hau Windfarm site, a method of converting shear wave velocity profiles was utilised. MASW surveying was used to determine VS profiles with depth, which were converted to elastic modulus profiles, with the input parameters of Poisson’s ratio and density. This study focuses on refining and improving the current method used for calculating elastic modulus values from shear‐wave velocities, primarily by improving the accuracy of the input parameters used in the calculation. Through the analysis of both geotechnical and geophysical data, the significant influence of overburden pressure, or depth, on the shear wave velocity was identified. Through each of the weathering grades, there was a non‐linear increase in shear wave velocity with depth. This highlights the need for overburden pressure conditions to be considered before assigning characteristic shear wave velocity values to different lithologies. Further to the dataset analysis of geotechnical and geophysical information, a multiple variant non‐linear regression analysis was performed on the three variables of shear wave velocity, depth and weathering grade. This produced a predictive equation for determining shear wave velocity within the Esk <b>Head</b> <b>belt</b> ‘greywacke’ when depth and weathering data are known. If the insitu geological conditions are not comparable to that of the windfarm sites in this study, a set of guidelines have been developed, detailing the most efficient and cost effective method of using MASW surveying to calculate the elastic modulus through the depth profile of an investigation site...|$|E
40|$|Detrital zircon U-Pb {{ages and}} Rb-Sr {{metamorphic}} ages from low-grade Torlesse Supergroup metasedimentary rocks from North Canterbury and Marlborough provide preliminary {{evidence for a}} continuation of the Kaweka Terrane of the central North Island into the Torlesse Composite Terrane of the South Island. This would extend from {{the south side of the}} Wairau Fault in the upper Wairau River valley southwards to the Lake Tennyson and Lake Sumner areas, and as far as Hawarden. Rb-Sr ages indicate Jurassic metamorphism, 170 ± 24 Ma, with initial ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios at that time 0. 7073 ± 0. 0007 i. e. similar to their North Island counterparts. These Kaweka Terrane rocks have detrital zircon ages that follow the distinctive pattern of the Torlesse rocks in general, i. e. substantial (> 30 %) Permian-Triassic and Precambrian-Early Palaeozoic groupings, but they also have minor youngest age components c. 175 - 165 Ma which constrain a maximum Early-Middle Jurassic depositional age. In detail, significant, older zircon components are Late Permian-Early Triassic (260 - 240 Ma) and Late Triassic (220 - 210 Ma), but the Precambrian-Early Palaeozoic detrital zircon ages are more scattered. The Kaweka Terrane thus forms a linear belt (c. 500 km) along the length of the Torlesse Composite Terrane in both North and South Islands. In the South Island it coincides with the Esk <b>Head</b> <b>Belt,</b> i. e. east of the Rakaia Terrane (Triassic-La te Permian) and west of the Pahau Terrane (Early Cretaceous-Late Jurassic). 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Although it is {{believed}} that exemption to the ruling has been common, coal underground beltways in mine areas developed since 1978 in Queensland are required to have <b>belt</b> <b>heading</b> air segregated from other intake headings to improve the likelihood of maintenance of an uncontaminated escape airway {{in the event of a}} mine fire. Furthermore, the 1996 Moura No 2 Warden’s Inquiry Recommendations set down that underground mines should have one intake airway that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate intake airways means of egress from the mine.

A number of Queensland mines are facing conditions of having to mine through extensive seam pockets of high concentration unpleasant and toxic gases such as H 2 S.
