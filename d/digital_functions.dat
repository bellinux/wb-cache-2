5000|$|Some FPGAs have analog {{features}} {{in addition to}} <b>digital</b> <b>functions.</b> The most common analog feature is programmable slew rate on each output pin,allowing the engineer to set low rates on lightly loaded pins that would otherwise ring or couple unacceptably, and to set higher rates on heavily loaded pins on high-speed channels that would otherwise run too slowly.Also common are quartz-crystal oscillators, on-chip resistance-capacitance oscillators, and phase-locked loops with embedded voltage-controlled oscillators used for clock generation and management and for high-speed serializer-deserializer (SERDES) transmit clocks and receiver clock recovery. Fairly common are differential comparators on input pins designed {{to be connected to}} differential signaling channels.A few [...] "mixed signal FPGAs" [...] have integrated peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with analog signal conditioning blocks allowing them to operate as a system-on-a-chip.Such devices blur the line between an FPGA, which carries digital ones and zeros on its internal programmable interconnect fabric,and field-programmable analog array (FPAA), which carries analog values on its internal programmable interconnect fabric.|$|E

40|$|Raynaud’s {{phenomenon}} (RP) describes excessive vasoconstriction of {{the digital}} microvasculature in response to cold exposure and emotional stress. RP is typically the earliest clinical manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc); a complex multisystem disease of unknown aetiology characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation and fibrosis. Vasculopathy is considered an essential pre-requisite to tissue remodeling, characterized by excessive collagen synthesis and tissue fibrosis, which occurs in the skin and other organs of patients with SSc. There is mounting evidence associating platelets with important biological functions beyond primary haemostasis. Upon activation, platelets release a large array of mediators implicated in vasoconstriction, inflammation and fibrosis, which has led me to consider the contribution of platelets to the pathogenesis of both RP and SSc. The principal aim of this thesis is to explore the impact of targeted anti-thrombotic therapy on <b>digital</b> microvascular <b>function,</b> platelet activation, oxidative stress and eicosanoid biosynthesis in RP and SSc. It {{is not possible to}} examine the impact of anti-platelet therapy on microvascular function, without first identifying sensitive methods for assessing <b>digital</b> microvascular <b>function</b> in humans. I shall report the findings of work examining established (infrared thermography) and novel (laser speckle contrast imaging) methods for the objective assessment of <b>digital</b> microvascular <b>function</b> in RP and SSc. I shall critically appraise the application of these methods alongside subjective patient self-report assessment of <b>digital</b> vascular <b>function.</b> I shall examine associations between <b>digital</b> vascular <b>function,</b> platelet activation, oxidative stress and eicosanoid biosynthesis between primary RP and SSc.
