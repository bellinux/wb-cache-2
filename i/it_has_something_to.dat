25|$|His basic {{approach}} was to combine several fundamental constants {{in order to}} produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the charge of the electron were a natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac, also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E
500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact}} that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
60|$|I nodded, for I {{thought it}} better to assent, though I did not quite {{understand}} his dialect. I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the church.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, some alarmist {{tale about}} {{somebody}} robbing father. I didn't quite {{make out what}} it was all about, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the pay-roll." ...|$|R
60|$|Walthew thought <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with his}} arrival. He was no longer suspicious, but puzzled. He was among friends, but they had {{received}} him in a curious manner.|$|R
2500|$|Those {{who claim}} it has {{symbolic}} meaning cannot explain {{what it would}} have meant. Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum notes that [...] "the engraving is at the point in the cave where the cave's orientation changes by 90 degrees" [...] and speculates whether the scratches were related to the location: [...] "It's almost like Clapham Junction, like it's showing an intersection. I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'." [...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave." [...] Harrold Dibble comments that [...] "It takes more than a few scratches—deliberate or not—to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals." ...|$|E

5000|$|Unsure of his abilities, {{and often}} incompetent, Jack can't {{figure out why}} he keeps getting promoted. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with his father (George Coe) being an {{influential}} (but corrupt) Senator? ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"There," [...] said I, [...] "if I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} woman. You {{are always}} running after some one, Rube. They will get you into a scrape some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I can {{see that}} <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> do with football, so we'll leave it at that. I suppose it's something like our quarter-back. And what's an international?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, May, I know it. Call it sin if you will--and my {{knowledge}} of <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with my present determination, for, weak though I am, and bad though you think me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{good deal}} {{you will have to}} give up," [...] he told her. [...] "You're not afraid of our new and rugged country? But <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer--and we need such people as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really I don't know. I {{understood}} that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with a}} party, but I think {{the fact is that}} Mary was too lazy to look after the servants while they packed up." ...|$|R
6000|$|LUBIN [discovering Conrad's {{presence}} for {{the first}} time] Youre right: it was. I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with women. My memory never deceives me. Thank you. Will you introduce me to this gentleman, Barnabas? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not exactly. But Mrs Hearn {{said she}} could {{understand}} there had been words {{between her and the}} squire. It couldn't be anything else, you know. Probably <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with that man, Crosbie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All men can try {{to carry}} out orders, Roger, {{but it is not}} all who can do it with intelligence. Doubtless, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the book {{learning}} that you have, and in which you were his instructor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a seasonable statute {{out of the}} testaments," [...] {{explained}} Burrows. [...] "It's {{ordered by}} the Pope or somebody. And <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the Zodiac I don't know exactly, but I think it was invented by the Egyptians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't worry, Mother dear. He didn't know I was {{questioning}} him. And I do love a mystery! All I {{learned was}} that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Canada.

50|$|The name’s {{meaning is}} unclear. Could <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{do with an}} early settler named “Wind”, or does the community’s Wendish past yield the name? The leaping {{greyhound}} (a Wendish symbol) in the coat of arms might offer a clue.|$|R
60|$|No, no, {{it was not}} lack {{of enthusiasm}} that killed the Whirlwind Campaign in Mariposa. <b>It</b> must <b>have</b> been <b>something</b> else.

6000|$|... "I think," [...] I said slowly, rummaging {{my memory}} half in vain, [...] "I {{remember}} <b>something</b> about <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with photography, hadn't it?...No, no, with the electric light....I can't exactly remember which.

6000|$|... "I suppose <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with poachers." [...] Fitzpiers {{was still}} so {{shaken by the}} sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile, {{and it was not}} until Grace said, [...] "If I could only get my skirt out nobody would know {{anything}} about it," [...] that he bestirred himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the}} law. If this out-of-the-way place, now, could furnish even a lubberly attorney, we might learn all about it.

60|$|The {{whole day}} the Snow-man {{looked through the}} window; towards dusk the room grew still more inviting; the stove gave out a mild light, {{not at all like}} the moon or even the sun; no, as only a stove can shine, when <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> feed upon. When the door of the room was open, it flared up-this was one of its peculiarities; it flickered quite red upon the Snow-man's white face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I knew <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with cookin'-things," [...] {{answered}} the cowboy.

6000|$|... "Hear me out, sir," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon; [...] "I {{have here in}} my hands the last opinion given in this matter by Sir Abraham Haphazard.

50|$|She however {{does not}} get on with Sue, and spends little time with Joanna. She left the {{hospital}} with Peter, the Irish director who took her to Toronto. However, soon after, she died of unknown causes; Guy, in the post-series 2 special, said <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with a moose.|$|R
60|$|Miss Marchmont {{wanted her}} tea, but could never resist {{a last look}} at the Elgin Marbles. She looked at them sideways, waving her hand and muttering a word or two of salutation which made Jacob and the other man turn round. She smiled at them amiably. It all came into her philosophy--that colour is sound, or perhaps <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with music. And having done her service, she hobbled off to tea. It was closing time. The public {{collected}} in the hall to receive their umbrellas.|$|E
60|$|Now {{though you}} may not guess it, my father, I have told you this tale because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with my story; for {{scarcely}} had the matter been ended when messengers came, saying that Bulalio, chief of the People of the Axe, and his impi were without, having returned with much spoil from the slaying of the Halakazi in Swaziland. Now when I heard this my heart leapt for joy, seeing that I had feared greatly for the fate of Umslopogaas, my fosterling. Dingaan also was very glad, and, springing up, danced to and fro like a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell? I believe <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do {{with that}} horrid man I told you of. You sent a letter upstairs this morning. I met Joseph on the landing, and took the letter to her myself. Why shouldn't I look at the postmark? Where was the harm in saying to her, 'A letter, mamma, from Wurzburg'? She {{looked at me as}} if I had mortally {{offended}} her--and pointed to the door, and locked herself in. I have knocked twice, and asked her to forgive me. Not a word of answer either time! I consider myself insulted. Let me go to Fritz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know!" [...] {{burst out}} Mr. Jones with amazing heat. [...] "That hotel-keeper {{tried to talk}} to me once of some girl he had lost, but I told him I didn't want to hear any of his beastly women stories. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with you, had it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not how {{it affects}} me," [...] {{returned}} Sir Robert, in the same tone; [...] "and as they might think that because Frank was with them on that California mountain we would believe <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Richardson involving the Bank in that wretched company, we must really INSIST upon their coming." ...|$|R
60|$|Evelyn {{rose and}} waited by her chair. Something {{she did not}} {{understand}} was going on, and the hint of intrigue excited her. She trusted Grahame, and she thought his object was good.
