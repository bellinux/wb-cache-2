However, some EU states may and do make multilateral agreements about defence issues outside of the EU structures.|$|R
50|$|The Military Staff has {{supervised}} {{a number}} of deployments since its establishment. The term EUFOR or European Union Force {{has been used to}} describe {{a number of}} military deployments, and has been used four times so far: in the Republic of Macedonia from March 2003 to December 2003 as EUFOR Concordia, in Bosnia from 2004 as EUFOR Althea, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2006 (EUFOR DR Congo), and in Chad (EUFOR Tchad/RCA) and the Central African Republic since 2007. EUFOR is a temporary military deployment, not a permanent military force, and {{should not be confused with}} the Eurocorps, Eurofor or the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> Force <b>Catalogue,</b> sometime misleadingly known as the 'European Rapid Reaction Force'. The name 'EUFOR' probably was patterned in imitation of NATO's IFOR, SFOR, and KFOR.|$|R
5000|$|The European Union {{made its}} first {{concrete}} step to enhance military capabilities, {{in line with the}} ESDP, in 1999 when its member states signed the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal.</b> They include the creation of a catalogue of forces, the 'Helsinki Force Catalogue', to be able to carry out the so-called “Petersberg Tasks”. The EU launched the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP) at the Laeken Summit in December 2001. However, {{it became clear that the}} objectives outlined in the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> were not achievable quickly. In May 2004, EU defence ministers approved [...] "Headline Goal 2010", extending the timelines for the EU's projects. However, it became clear that the objectives cannot be achieved by this date too. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé espressed his desperation: “The common security and defense policy of Europe? It is dead.” ...|$|R
50|$|The Battlegroups {{project is}} not to be {{confused}} with the projected <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> force, which concerns up to 60,000 soldiers, deployable for at least a year, and take one to two months to deploy. The Battlegroups are instead meant for more rapid and shorter deployment in international crises, probably preparing the ground for a larger and more traditional force to replace them in due time.|$|R

To that end, a number of {{efforts were made to}} increase the EU's military capability, notably the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500personnel.|$|R
50|$|The EUMC was {{formally}} established in December 2000 by the European Council of Nice, {{and is one}} of several defence and security-related bodies established {{as a result of the}} <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal,</b> which was decided in December 1999. EUMC is composed of the Chiefs of Defence of the EU Member States who are represented on a regular basis by their permanent military representatives in Brussels, who often are two- or three-star flag officers. A similar committee also exists within NATO, and those countries which are members of both EU and NATO have in most cases chosen to use the same person as permanent military representative to both organisations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was a {{military}} capability target set for 2003 during the December 1999 Helsinki European Council meeting {{with the aim of}} developing a future European Rapid Reaction Force. There was much interest in the idea of a single EU military force, and inexact characterisations of the initiative (which was not much more than some headquarters arrangements and a list of theoretically available national forces) led to imprecise journalistic depictions about a unified European Army. Following the initial declaration in December 1999, the formal agreement on the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> was reached on November 22, 2004 and according to statements made by EU officials the first units will be deployable in 2007. Since January, 1st of 2007 60,000 soldiers have been available for a possible European Rapid Reaction Force who are potentially deployable for at least a year.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> became fulfilled, the European Council of June 2004 {{approved}} to further develop the EU’s military crisis management capability {{and a new}} target was set: the [...] "Headline Goal 2010". EU members made the commitment {{that by the year}} 2010, at the latest, they would be capable of responding [...] "with swift and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach" [...] to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty of the EU and the 2003 EU Security Strategy (i.e. humanitarian and rescue tasks, disarmament operations, support to third countries in combating terrorism, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, and peacemaking). The EU also aims to address the shortfalls from the previous <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> (e.g. gaps related to strategic airlift and sealift) which are still considered to be a limiting factor to the operability of the designated forces, especially in more demanding crisis management operations.|$|R

40|$|The {{announcement}} of the establishment of rapid response European Battlegroups (EUBG) in the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> of 2004, functioning as the first European military capabilities, was marked as the start {{for the establishment of}} a common defence and security policy in the European Union. It is argued that the EUBG were a logical consequence of de further deepening of the European integration process at the end of the 1990 s and would prove that even on such a sensitive issue the member states were able to contribute without only pursuing the national interest. This research focuses on the implementation and impact of the EUBG concept and shows that there must be a clear distinction between paper reality and the military feasibility of supranational cooperation. Subject to many determining factors the EUBG have never been deployed and are not recognized as common support until today. As such, this research seeks for the substantiation why the EUBG did not succeed in their primary task as accelerator of the integration process. This research suggests that without a policy-based embedding, a military executive organization misses not only the right facilities, but it is also insufficiently supported to be successful in the end...|$|R
40|$|The Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, {{during the}} first {{semester}} of 2002, came at a singular time {{for the development of}} the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Despite the important progress achieved by previous presidencies, numerous challenges remained, and the work towards the achievement of the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> by 2003 was obviously the most notable one. The declaration of the European Council at Laeken in December 2001, making ESDP operational, immediately encouraged some member states to put forward the need to commit in the shortest term the EU’s crisis management capabilities in the Balkans. But the disagreement of some countries on the issue of the participation of NATO’s European allies in ESDP continues to hinder progress in this direction. Nevertheless, Spain has conducted a very fruitful Presidency, achieving very substantial progress in many aspects and launching initiatives that complement the mandate received in Laeken. In order to have a clear picture of the achievements of the Spanish Presidency in the field of ESDP, it is important to begin with a very brief description of the situation at the end of the Belgian Presidency...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In December 1998, French and British leaders {{declared that the}} European Union (EU) must develop the capacity for autonomous military action to respond to international crises. In December 1999, EU leaders meeting in <b>Helsinki</b> established the <b>Headline</b> Goal-defined as the autonomous ability to deploy 60, 000 troops in 60 days for an operation lasting {{as long as one}} year to conduct the "Petersberg Tasks" of humanitarian intervention, peacekeeping, and peacemaking. The deadline for the operational capability of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> is December 2003. Although in December 2001 the EU declared that it had "some" operational capability, it remains unable to conduct certain Petersberg Tasks, especially "upper" level missions such as peacemaking on the model of NATO's Kosovo intervention. Despite the current military force structures of EU member states, significant capability shortfalls, and stagnant or declining defense budgets in most EU countries, it appears that the EU will be able to conduct lower-level Petersberg Tasks in permissive environments by December 2003. However, capabilities needed for upper level tasks, such as strategic airlift, will take several years to develop and acquire-far beyond the deadline of December 2003.

5000|$|Battlegroups as a {{combined}} arms military unit, based around an infantry battalion or armoured regiment, {{are not a}} new concept. However, the initial ideas for specific EU Battlegroups began at the European Council summit on 10-11 December 1999 in Helsinki. The Council produced the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> 2003 and specified {{the need for a}} rapid response capability that members should provide in small forces at high readiness. The idea was reiterated at a Franco-British summit on 4 February 2003 in Le Touquet which highlighted as a priority the need to improve rapid response capabilities, [...] "including initial deployment of land, sea and air forces within 5-10 days." [...] This was again described as essential in the [...] "Headline Goal 2010".|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> 2010 and the decision to create rapidly deployable ‘battlegroups’ are proof of the continued dynamism of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Yet, although major progress has been booked in recent years, and further important achievements can be expected in the short term, not all questions relating to ESDP have already been addressed by policy-makers. All EU Member States are engaged in the transformation of their armed forces. Because of budgetary constraints, this is necessarily a gradual process. Furthermore, {{for most of the}} Member States it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the traditional wide range of capabilities in army, navy and air force. This paper will set out to assess whether cooperation, pooling and specialisation in the framework of the EU can offer an answer to these challenges...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{examined}} the question of; “how has the Lisbon Treaty changed the way the EU is able to apply force” through a breaking down of key concepts and categories inspecting EU’s role in or use of power, peacekeeping and global actorness in relation to how the Lisbon Treaty has changed the EU’s relation to these. The project has utilized leading authors {{on the field of}} EU studies to as a theoretical framework grounding the analysis in the conceptions of these authors. The project concludes that the innovations of the Lisbon Treaty has empowered a militarisation of the EU in its peacekeeping effort, but has not changed the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goals</b> of the EU foreign policy as reflected in the Petersberg Tasks. This implies that the Lisbon Treaty might not have changed the EU’s normative power, and further fuels the debate of whether the EU is or still is not a global actor...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, poverty {{has been}} {{high on the}} agenda of the European Union and the 27 Member States. They have engaged in {{considerable}} activities to tackle poverty and social exclusion in Europe. The Member States agreed upon a broad range of sophisticated methodologies to measure poverty and exclusion. At the heart of these methodologies is the EU-SILC approach, which provides the most relevant and “visible” data on income and living conditions across Europe including those of millions of households in (income) poverty. A sign of the prominent place of the poverty agenda {{is the fact that the}} year 2010 was declared the “European Year Against Poverty and Social Exclusion”, a year dedicated to programmes and events aiming to raise academic, political and public awareness regarding poverty and to combat social exclusion more forcefully. Furthermore, one of the five high-profile <b>headline</b> <b>goals</b> of the EU 2020 process was dedicated to the containment of poverty and social exclusion, including explicit quantitative targets. It goes without saying that these efforts and intentions are commendable, and in the interest of future social cohesion in Europe.|$|R
40|$|The European Union and {{its member}} states have moved with {{considerable}} speed towards {{the creation of}} a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). Whether what has been achieved so far adds up to a revolution remains a moot point. The Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Maastricht Treaty has not always been noted for its binding character, and too often the debate over security and defence has degenerated into an artificial, zero-sum-type game between Atlanticists and Europeanists. What is required for the success of the ESDP is not simply continued commitment to achieving the <b>Headline</b> <b>Goals</b> set out at Helsinki in 1999, but also the development of what the authors call a ‘strategic culture’, i. e. an institutional confidence and processes to manage and deploy military force as part of the effective range of legitimate policy instruments of the Union. The authors argue that political commitment at the highest levels has been underpinned by the institutionalization, within the Council Secretariat, of the ‘military option’ {{in the form of the}} Military Committee and a Directorate General for the EU’s Military Staff (DGEUMS). Even more importantly, there are already signs, especially through such concepts as ‘security sector reform’ and ‘structural stability’, that the EU, through its development and humanitarian programmes, has already recognized the necessity of military solutions...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of current procedures in security and defence research planning we developed a conceptual approach for a future methodology for security research planning at EU level. We investigated the planning models of the EU Framework Programme Security Research (European Security Research Advisory Board - ESRAB), the European Defence Agency's (EDA) Capability Development Plan (CDP) and its European Defence Research & Technology (EDRT) Strategy, taking into account recent activities within the EU Civilian <b>Headline</b> <b>Goal</b> (CHG), {{as well as the}} Unites States' Department of Homeland Security approach in order to extract commonalities and differences. By comparing these approaches with the current modus operandi in security research planning at EU level (i. e. ESRIF, the European Security Research & Innovation Forum) we identified some potential for refinements of the current methodology with respect to "capability-based planning" - already invented by ESRAB - and "performance-based management", i. e. enabling the evaluation of EU security capabilities and respective security research planning with respect to the realisation/ implementation of predefined performance goals for the security architecture. Bearing in mind that the realities of EU security research planning (at the moment) do not allow for an optimum, "truly" demand-driven planning solution, we present a pragmatic approach to develop a framework for a capability-based planning on EU level and possibly, e. g. as a reference, also for national security research, potentially contributing to a harmonisation of security application requirements at EU and Member State level...|$|R

40|$|The European Security and Defence Policy or ESDP is {{considered}} a major element of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, {{the second of the}} three so-called ?pillars? of the European Union (EU). The ESDP was initiated by provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty (1997) which stipulated the progressive framing of a common security and defense policy that could deal with humanitarian and rescue, peacekeeping, peacemaking and combat forces crisis management tasks, called the Petersberg tasks. When the Cologne European Council in June 1999 appointed Javier Solana as the High representative of the CFSP they also declared that ?the EU must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO?.

In this context, participation of libraries in information networks is a positive alternative. Libraries should not be bound to their local book collection, but they also need to expand it through networks, so that they are able to borrow books or exchange documents with other libraries. University libraries need to create storage of local documents with open access to theses, dissertations, scientific research papers and their institutional memory.

40|$|The thesis {{will define}} Italian {{contribution}} to European {{integration in the}} field of Security and Defence Policy. The first objective of this research is to describe how Italy placed itself in the debate on the development of ESDP if compared to the Franco‐German couple and the British approach: two opposing views dominated this debate: Atlanticism and the “autonomous” approach to European Defence. The former has been supported by the UK and other countries; The latter has been supported by the Franco‐German couple and other countries. Italy has often placed in between, by assuring conformity of the European initiatives with NATO, while promoting a stronger cooperation in a European framework. The thesis analyses in depth the Italian defence policy, the contribution to the European military and civilian capabilities and operations, the participation of Italian high brass in ESDP and NATO structures, the industrial interests in European defence industry and in the intergovernmental cooperation in armaments. The research utilise the Foreign Policy Analysis method, by means of a three level: transatlantic level (relations between US and European allies through NATO); European (relation between Anglo‐ Italians and Franco‐German approaches) internal (the interests of main Italian stakeholders: Politicians, Military, Diplomats and Industry). The main findings are that Italy had given to the ESDP a more sound contribution than expected. This is mainly due to the cooperation with the UK and the bureaucratic interests of the internal administrative actors. Italy is together with France is the first troops contributor for the EU military capabilities. The British‐Italian cooperation has led to new concepts for the ESDP, such as the <b>headline</b> <b>goal</b> and has boosted the military operation in the bilateral, NATO, and ESDP framework. Italy has been leading in the civilian capabilities and operations, in particular in Police Missions and Civil Protection. The Italian defence industry is emerging as a key actor in the European and US markets. The lack of a consistent national security and defence policy, because the ruling class is not interested, boosts the bureaucratic interests of the administrative élites that are shaping the role of Italy in the development of ESDP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Classifications {{have been}} used for centuries with the <b>goal</b> of <b>cataloguing</b> and searching large sets of objects.

Classifications describe their contents using natural language labels, an approach which has proved very effective in manual classification. However natural language labels show their limitations when one tries to automate the process, as they make it very hard to reason about classifications and their contents. In this paper we introduce the novel notion of Formal Classification, as a graph structure where labels are written in a propositional concept language. Formal Classifications turn out to be some form of lightweight ontologies. This, in turn, allows us to reason about them, to associate to each node a normal form formula which univocally describes its contents, and to reduce document classification and query answering to reasoning about subsumption. ...|$|R

The {{future of}} cm and m-wave {{astronomy}} {{lies with the}} Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope under development by a consortium of 17 countries that will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio facility.

The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a technology demonstrator aimed in the mid-frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phased-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. The large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope that will make substantial advances in SKA key science. ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, {{one of the most}} radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of two sites selected by the international community as a potential location for the SKA.
