5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not <b>just</b> <b>focus</b> on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

500|$|On February 3, 2005, Bethesda {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Take-Two Interactive regarding the publication and release of Oblivion. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over Oblivions development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently formed 2K Games sub brand. According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, {{and it was a}} surprise that Bethesda's experience worked out as well as it did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a [...] "fantastic product" [...] with minimal interference or [...] "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers. [...] Ashley Cheng, Oblivions senior producer, concurred. There was [...] "complete freedom" [...] at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say. Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay, Todd Howard said that he, as a producer, wasn't involved with corporate affairs.

If I hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction.

2500|$|The instant {{success of}} [...] "Roses Are Red" [...] proved to Aqua that their new sound was {{popular with the}} public, {{and as a result}} their {{follow-up}} single followed the same formula. Titled [...] "My Oh My", the single again featured catchy lyrics paired with a soft, melodic beat. Upon its release in February 1997, [...] "My Oh My" [...] broke all Danish sales records by being certified gold within six days. The single went straight to number one in Denmark, and made Aqua a household name in the country. The first two singles proved to Universal Music Denmark that Aqua was a very marketable group, and as a result the label looked to start marketing their music across the continent. Aqua released their debut album Aquarium in Denmark on 26 March 1997. The album contained 11 tracks, including their first two singles and their then upcoming third single [...] "Barbie Girl". Universal Music Group had by now begun to market the group in other countries, releasing [...] "Roses Are Red" [...] in Japan in February 1997 and in various countries across Europe in late 1996. The single had proven popular everywhere it was sold, convincing Universal that the group should not <b>just</b> <b>focus</b> on the Danish market, but instead on the general European market.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, the {{literature}} is divided {{in terms of whether}} it is personal dispositions (Collins et al. 2004) and family background (Scherer et al. 1989), or situational and contextual elements ((Di Gregorio and Shane 2003); (Louis 1989); (Souitaris 2007)) that make a person entrepreneurial; with some authors <b>just</b> <b>focusing</b> on individual level factors while others <b>just</b> <b>focusing</b> on organizational-level factors. There is a dearth of literature that combines the two together to see how both the individual characteristics and situational factors impact an individual’s entrepreneurial behavior (Walter et al. 2013).

30|$|Exploration and {{exploitation}} are two essential concepts of meta-heuristic algorithms. The aim of exploration {{is to find}} new solutions in the search space, so it takes advantage of random steps to discover solutions from {{different regions of the}} search space. On the other hand, the aim of exploitation is to create new solutions based on the solutions which have previously been found during the search process. If a meta-heuristic algorithm <b>just</b> <b>focuses</b> on exploration, it acts like a random search algorithm which is a highly inefficient way to search the solution space. On the other hand, if a meta-heuristic algorithm <b>just</b> <b>focuses</b> on exploitation, it is not able to efficiently discover and search all regions of solution space. So, it may be involve in the local optima. Therefore, any meta-heuristic algorithm needs to make a balance between exploration {{and exploitation}} properties to find optimal solutions without searching the whole solution space.|$|R
