60|$|<b>Holder</b> <b>sprang</b> to {{his feet}} and made his way rapidly around the table, where he stood confronting the woman in the doorway. There she was, perceptibly swaying, as though the floor under her were rocked by an earthquake. Her {{handsome}} face was white as chalk, her pupils widened in terror. It was curious, at such an instant, that he should have taken in her costume,--yet {{it was part of the}} mystery. She wore a new, close-fitting, patently expensive suit of dark blue cloth and a small hat, which were literally transforming in their effect, demanding a palpable initial effort of identification.|$|R
40|$|A {{helically}}-threaded <b>spring</b> <b>holder</b> {{on which}} a helically wound spring is mounted has a groove formed in {{one side of the}} thread at the end where the spring engages the <b>spring</b> <b>holder.</b> The groove relieves the portion of the side in which it is formed from restricting the spring against axial movement during deflection of the spring. The circumferential length of this groove is chosen to establish the number of spring coils which can be deflected without contacting the side of the thread. The end of the thread is also made rigid to prevent flexing thereof during maximal elongation of the spring...|$|R

50|$|As {{it enters}} Floral City, it runs {{much closer to}} and {{parallel}} to US 41. South of Inverness across from Citrus County Speedway and the Inverness Airport, there is a paid access trail leading to Fort Cooper State Park. Within Inverness itself, the trail runs under State Road 44, with access trails on both sides running east. North of there, the trail runs through Cooter Pond Park, Wallace Brooks Park and Liberty Park, then uses a former railroad bridge over a section of Lake Henderson. Beneath the bridge under US 41, another trail leads to Whispering Pines Park. In Hernando, the trail is briefly detoured around County Road 486 for one block, then resumes its use of the former railroad right-of-way as it continues through <b>Holder,</b> and Citrus <b>Springs,</b> where it finally ends at Gulf Junction just south of Dunnellon.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{procedure for}} investigation of leakage and stiffness characteristics of bionic cluster spiral groove DGS and spiral groove DGS are provided as follows. Firstly, the rotating rings and stationary rings are cleaned in a bath ultrasonically with acetone for 5  min, the spring stiffness of the springs used is measured and eddy current sensor is calibrated before the experiment. Secondly, the stator and rotor specimens are {{installed in the}} <b>holders,</b> and the <b>spring</b> compression is measured. The desired gas pressure is set to 0.5  MPa and 0.4  MPa in the hydrostatic performance test and hydrodynamic performance test respectively; {{the speed of the}} motor is programmed to 8000  r/min in the dynamic pressure performance test. Spring force is changed by steps of 3  N, adjusted by the three uniformly distributed micro meters, and each force step is maintained for 1  min following the stabilization of the film thickness and leakage rate at a steady value. The test ends when a minimum film thickness of 1.5  μm is reached or if the leakage rate exceeds a value of 10  L/min. The gas pressure in the chamber under constant rotational speed and spring force is increased in a stepwise manner to examine the leakage and stiffness characteristics of these two types of DGSs at different gas pressure. In each step, the machine runs at a constant speed and gas pressure for 1  min. Each of the carbon rotating rings is used less than five times to ensure that the end faces are hardly worn. What’s more, experiments for the same seal ring under the given conditions are repeated twice to guarantee the repeatability of the results. At the same time, the film thickness, leakage rate, gas pressure and rotational speed are monitored and recorded by a high-speed data acquisition system with a sampling rate of 1000  Hz. At last, the collected data are output to an “.xls” file for graphic presentation.|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{miniaturization}} and {{the continuing}} increase in clock speed and data transfer, power dissipation in many electronic components has exceeded the limits of conventional cooling methodologies, such as fan-blown air cooling. Given the expected increase in power density, microprocessor designers have identified cooling {{as one of the}} major challenges for the next decade. Similar needs arise from the further development of other electronic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LED), where future generations of high light-output multichip LED modules are being developed for general and automotive illumination applications as well as for power electronics. Hence, there is a tremendous need for innovative cooling technologies. One of the most important factors in reducing the lifetime of micro-electronic components is the high operation temperature and thermal cycling. Liquid cooling has been identified {{as one of the most}} promising solutions in reducing the operation temperature of high power electronics. Liquid cooling is often not optimized, leading to excess of cooling and large temperature variations over the IC. If the coolant is allowed to boil in the cooling channels, the heat transfer coefficient is increased with one order of magnitude. The problem of phase transition regime is the boiling instability. A solution of these problems is addressed by implementation of valves in the cooling system. For single-phase systems they have the role of maintaining a more uniform temperature over the IC and to reduce the pumping power. For two-phase systems the valve purpose is to maintain the most optimum boiling conditions. A comparative study of different actuation principles was performed to identify the best actuation technology applied for chip cooling valves which meet the cooling requirements targeted in this PhD project. This classifies the valve size between the micro and macro-scale, a field which has been mainly overlooked by prior research and potentially promising applications have not been yet explored. It is for the first time that valves are especially designed for chip cooling applications. The principal requirements for the mechanical valves are the following: no leakage to the environment, low power consumption, continuous and proportional flow control, low cost, fast response time, small size and high reliability. The most promising actuation technology found for single-phase flow is thermopneumatic actuation. Based on this principle, a valve has been designed manufactured and tested on a cooling system. The valve actuation is performed by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same time, actuates the valve and provides feed-back sensing. The thermopneumatic valve shows a novel actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption, small size compared with the high flow rate, and low manufacturing costs. This valve has the major advantage that it can be used together with any heat sink used for microelectronic cooling. Its small size and its independence from external energy make it suited for portable devices. No electrical connection, no wires and no electronic control are needed, increasing its simplicity and reliability. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg/h passes through the valve for a heat load up to 133 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and has the capability to reduce the temperature variation over the IC with up to 24 %. The most suitable actuation principle found for two-phase cooling is electro- magnetic actuation for large bandwidth, large forces, relatively high strokes and low manufacturing cost. The electromagnetic valve uses the reluctance actuation principle. It makes use of a pilot valve to reduce the size and the required actuation force. The emphasis is placed on a compact planar design to fit in planar devices. A pressure balance design allows operation at high system pressures. Because the pressure balance is used to drive the valve, an analytical and numerical model has been developed to predict the pressure distribution over the valve. The pilot valve has also been modelled as well and linearised using the results obtained from the model. The results of the model have been successfully validated by measurements. The valve is capable to control a flow rate up to 15 kg/h. This flow rate is sufficient to remove a heat input of 133 W equivalent with a heat flux of 500 W/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 20 deg. C. Its equilibrated design allows a pressure drop control of up to 100 kPa at maximum system pressures of 600 kPa. Compared with the latest research published in literature and the latest developments in industry, this electromagnetic valve classifies on top of the list when it comes to the following combined properties in a single package: high speed proportional control, compact dimensions, high flow rates at low pressure drop, high reliability and low manufacturing cost. This research demonstrates the need for valves and the benefits of using valves in high performance cooling systems.
