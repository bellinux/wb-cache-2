Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E

60|$|I {{think about}} nothing--sometimes I {{wonder if the}} linen is {{bleaching}} white, or <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see if the crows are picking up the chickens' food.|$|E
60|$|I {{went from}} place to place, corner to corner, bar to bar, watching, listening, recording; and not until long after sunset did <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the ranch.|$|E
60|$|Early in the {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> catch some fish for supper. We agreed to dispense with dinner, and have breakfast, lunch, and a good solid supper.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the door, {{the agent}} {{standing}} below {{me in the}} front garden. The Count came back alone, and drew me a few steps inside the passage.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> find Thomas, {{oppressed by}} a mild despair. If I were {{to tell my}} tales to a stone, I thought, it would turn on me with a sermon.|$|R

6000|$|The rider drew rein, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> meet him. After {{looking the}} horse all over, with a subtle show {{of not being}} in haste, I asked, [...] "How much will you take for him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{knows it}} would need three of us for a serious {{business}} like that. No, I felt lonesome and unhappy, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> look at the sea, and watch the pretty ships go by.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{came about}} six o'clock—in the motor-car with Marie. But the latter did not descend. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{assist with the}} parcels. Lettie {{had already begun to}} buy things; the wedding was fixed for July.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at me. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> spend a happy evening, meaning no harm to any one, and I {{come back}} all blue {{with the blood}} of the aristocracy. We now come to a serious point. Do you think my lady {{stepmother}} has read that sporting chronicle?" ...|$|E

60|$|The day {{had become}} very sultry {{by the time}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> visit my patients. The sky was {{overcast}} with dark thunderous clouds, and, as there seemed every chance of a heavy shower, I returned to my lodgings for an umbrella.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sunday, 24th.--This {{morning the}} wind went round to N.E. and N. and then died away. We were 55 miles W. of the Torres Islands at noon. Brooke took English and Mota morning Prayers.
