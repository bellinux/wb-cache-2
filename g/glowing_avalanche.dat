50|$|Peléan eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption. They can occur when viscous magma, typically of rhyolitic or andesitic type, is involved, and share some similarities with Vulcanian eruptions. The most important characteristic of a Peléan eruption {{is the presence of}} a <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanche</b> of hot volcanic ash, a pyroclastic flow. Formation of lava domes is another characteristical feature. Short flows of ash or creation of pumice cones may be observed as well.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Chemical {{data are}} {{presented}} for four hypersthenes and one coexisting hypersthene-augite pair, and chemical, X-ray, and thermomagnetic data presented for five titaniferous magnetites, all from various horizons of the Taupo pumice sequence. These phenocrysts {{are regarded as}} primary crystallization products, and not of xenocrystic origin. The hypersthenes range from Mg 46. 4 Fe 51. 4 Ca 2. ~ to Mg 6 ~. TFeal. 2 Ca 3. 1; the augite composition is Mg 48. sFe 12. 3 Caag. 2. Theoccurrence of such magnesian pyroxenes {{may be explained by}} the early separation oftitaniferous magnetite, although {{it is also possible that}} the initial iron ratios of the liquids were already sufficiently low to precipitate hese pyroxenes. The magnetites xhibit varying stages of oxidation. Data on the least oxidized specimens indicate they were initially magnetite-ulv 6 spinel solid solutions, with 40 to 50 % (mol.) solid solution ulv 6 spinel. Subsequent oxidation has modified their compositions; there is some evidence that this could have occurred during normal weathering processes. T HIS paper presents chemical data on the pyroxenes and magnetites of the Taupo pumice deposits, supplementing the previously pub-lished analytical data on the glasses and plagioclases (Ewart, 1963) in which data on the pyroxenes were inferred from optics only. The pumice deposits have been divided into 26 distinct horizons (members 1 (youngest) to 26), and these grouped into 10 eruptive episodes, i. e., during the course of one eruptive episode, several dis-t inct horizons were generally deposited. Radiocarbon dates put an age c. 130 A. D. on the youngest deposits; the oldest are c. 10 000 years. With the exception of members 1 and 2, all the deposits are of air-fall origin. Member 1 is believed to be of <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanche</b> origin; member 2 may be of phreatic or <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanche</b> origin. The centres of erup-tion are believed to lie in the area around the north-eastern corner of the Lake Taupo. Further details on the field relations of these deposits are given by Baumgart (1954) and Healy (1964). This study is based on the samples described in previous wor...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{changes in}} both the {{chemistry}} of coastal thermal waters and the soil CO 2 and Rn emissions in the crater area were recorded at Stromboli prior to the eruption that began on 28 December 2002. The dissolved CO 2 contents and the d 13 C and 3 He/ 4 He values were elevated in the thermal aquifer from July 2002. Synchronous variations in the same isotope ratios were recorded in the summit fumarolic gases, with both 3 He/ 4 He and d 13 C values of gases released from a fumarole in the summit area increasing between May and November 2002. These variations are indicative of early degassing of a new gas-rich magma batch with a 13 C- and 3 He-rich signature. This magma recharge probably fed the intense Strombolian activity recorded during that period. The eruption began with a major explosion that produced a <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanche,</b> immediately followed by a fluid lava overflow from the NE crater and subsequent lava effusion from vents opened in the Sciara del Fuoco depression. Sharp increases in CO 2 soil flux and Rn emissions— to values never observed previously—were recorded in the summit crater area 10 d before the eruption onset. These CO 2 and Rn anomalies are indicative of a high gas-driven magma supply rate and gas overpressure within the conduit. The sudden depressurization of the magma filling the upper conduit probably caused the major explosion that occurred on 28 December, which heralded the effusive phase. These data demonstrate the importance of collecting {{a wide spectrum of}} geochemical data from different geological sites when monitoring a volcano...|$|E

5000|$|Three {{modes of}} {{transport}} can be distinguished: pyroclastic flow, pyroclastic surge, and pyroclastic fall. During Plinian eruptions, pumice and ash are formed when silicic magma is fragmented in the volcanic conduit, because of decompression {{and the growth}} of bubbles. Pyroclasts are then entrained in a buoyant eruption plume which can rise several kilometers into the air and cause aviation hazards. Particles falling from the eruption clouds form layers on the ground (this is pyroclastic fall or tephra). Pyroclastic density currents, which are referred to as [...] "flows" [...] or [...] "surges" [...] depending on particle concentration and the level turbulence, are sometimes called <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanches.</b> The deposits of pumice-rich pyroclastic flows can be called ignimbrites.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{deposits}} {{of all four}} types of sediment support mechanisms are found in nature, pure grain flows are largely restricted to aeolian settings, whereas subaqueous environments are characterized by a spectrum of flow types with debris flows and mud flows {{on one end of}} the spectrum, and high-density and low-density turbidity currents on the other end. It is also useful in subaqueous environments to recognize transitional flows that are in between turbidity currents and mud flows. The {{deposits of}} these transitional flows are referred to by a variety of names, some of the more popular being [...] "hybrid-event beds (HEB)", linked debrites" [...] and [...] "surry beds". Powder snow <b>avalanches</b> and <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanches</b> (gas-charged flows of super heated volcanic ash) are examples of turbidity currents in non-marine settings.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMerapi volcano (Java, Indonesia) is {{in almost}} {{continuous}} activity with growth of an andesitic lava dome. This dome frequently collapses to form potentially deadly <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanches,</b> explosions and nuées ardentes. To monitor {{the evolution of}} surface displacements and to model the associated magmatic sources, we established a Global Positioning System (GPS) network in 1993 and have measured it each year using the static GPS method. However, {{the limited number of}} benchmarks and the geometry of the network did not allow us to precisely locate major mechanical discontinuities within the edifice. Precisely locating these discontinuities is of central importance because they delimit areas of potential instability and provide means to evaluate potential volumes of falling material. The kinematic GPS method offers a way to partially solve the problem of temporal and spatial sampling of the displacement field, but its accuracy is usually insufficient to monitor small displacements. We propose here a strategy of field measurements and adjustments which combines kinematic positioning (1 min) and rapid static baselines (15 min) to get a 1. 5 -cm error (95 % confidence). At Merapi summit, we have installed about 50 benchmarks covering the area around the main crater. Field measurements of this new network with our method take a few hours and the data processing has been automated. We present the results of 8 surveys from 1999 to 2002, a period that includes a dome collapse in January 2001. Our results show large horizontal displacements towards the northwest, starting in July 2000 and reaching about 50 cm in amplitude in November 2000 that we interpret as precursors to the dome collapse. We also locate two presently active discontinuities at the summit of the volcano. This approach can be implemented easily on other active volcanoes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 During the Pleistocene, an andesitic volcano named Mount Mazama grew to a {{probable}} elevation of 3000 meters in south- central Oregon. Near {{the end of}} the Pleistocene, three diverse magma types appeared in the eruptive products associated with Mount Mazama: l) High-alumina basaltic andesite magma associated with an early plateau and with coeval cinder cones; 2) Hypersthene andesite magma similar in composition to the andesite which had formed the main cone; 3) Dacite magma, erupted both as pyroclastic material and as flank lava flows after formation of the andesitic cone. Approximately 12, 000 - 13, 000 years ago, eruption of andesite and then dacite occurred along a semicircular fracture now represented by the north wall of the caldera. The eruption of dacite was a surface expression of a shallow chamber of dacite magma emplaced beneath Mount Mazama. Before and after emplacement of the dacite magma chamber, basaltic andesite erupted upon the lower flanks and plateau surrounding the volcano, The last such parasitic activity occurred at Forgotten Crater (on the western flank of Mount Mazama) where lava and pumice of intimately mixed dacite and basaltic andesite appeared. Approximately 6600 years ago, explosive eruption of dacite pumice began from central vents. The magma of these initial eruptions was characterized by discrete gas nuclei which expanded rapidly, disrupted the enclosing liquid into fine ash, and provided the energy to propel this ash high above the summit. As eruption proceeded, magma was tapped in which gas nuclei were actively forming and were thoroughly dispersed through the magma. At this stage, the erupted material behaved as a fluidized mass, frothed over the crater rim, and rushed down the slopes as <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanches.</b> Immediately following eruption of fluidized dacite, a more mafic magma was erupted in the form of basic scoria flows. This basic scoria was chemically, similar to par 3 sitic eruptions of basaltic andesite, and was not nearly as mobile as the earlier dacite ash-flows. The waning stages of eruption were characterized by crystal-rich basic scoria containing abundant fragments of andesite and granodiorite. Following the eruption of crystal- and lithic-rich basic scoria, the summit of Mount Mazama collapsed into the underlying magma chamber, producing the Crater Lake caldera. Soon after collapse, eruption of mafic magma occurred on the caldera floor, probably forming a lava lake. The last eruption formed an intra-caldera andesitic cone called Wizard Island Wizard Island lavas are chemically similar to the andesites which formed the main cone of Mount Mazama. Thus, a sequence of volcanic activity culminating in violent eruption and collapse, returned to its initial condition. Calculations of Mazama ash volume are presented and it is concluded that there is no discrepancy between volume of missing Mount Mazama and volume of erupted material. Crystal-rich basic scoria flows containing melted granitic fragments (torn from the margins of the dacite magma chamber) indicate that the chamber was essentially emptied during the culminating eruptions. It is suggested that basic scoria magma occupied the bottom portion of the dacite magma chamber. This mafic magma assimilated granodiorite which had crystallized around the margins of the dacite magma. A new model for the formation of the Crater Lake caldera is presented. In this model the magma types recognized at Crater Lake ascended through the crust as independent bodies. Whenever two of these magma types came into marginal contact, limited eruption of mixed magmas was possible. However, prior to the culminating eruptions, a high-temperatures basaltic andesite magma was injected into the lower portion of the volatile-saturated, cooling dacite magma. Energy transferred from the mafic magma triggered exsolution of gas in the silicic magma until vapor pressure exceeded confining pressure. Once eruption began, it did not stop until the chamber was depleted of its gas-rich magma. The Crater Lake caldera was formed when the unsupported summit of Mount Mazama collapsed into this sub-volcanic vacancy. Many other calderas, long recognized as a special (Krakatoan) type, were produced following the eruption of more than one magma. It is suggested that the process described above is an important caldera-forming mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The Soufriandegrave;re region, which {{includes}} the most recently active volcanic centre {{on the island of}} St. andnbsp;Lucia in the West Indies, is the site of a relatively recent volcanic caldera. This structure, with a diameter of approximately 4 miles, has an age of definitely more than 50, 000 years and probably of several times this age. Apart from continuous solfataric activity, there have been no historic eruptions, and the morphology of the caldera has been considerably modified by erosion since the time of its formation. The history of volcanic events in the Soufriandegrave;re region may be divided into four principal phases: the first involved the effusion of basalt lava from vents both within and to the east of the site of the ultimate caldera. During the second phase, following what was probably a long time-interval, a group of andesitic strato-volcanoes developed in an area slightly to the northeast of the ultimate caldera. These emitted andesite flows and, apparently, a very large volume (estimated a 6 cubic miles) of pyroclastic material, probably mainly as <b>glowing</b> <b>avalanches.</b> The third phase opened with the emission of andesite pumice fall and pumice flow from a vent which probably lay within the ultimate caldera. After an erosion interval, activity was renewed on a more violent scale, in a series of ultravulcanian explosions, and these were followed by a second period of voluminous, andesite pumice flows which immediately preceded caldera subsidence. The fourth and final phase has occupied the relatively long period since collapse, during which fifteen volcanic domes and seven craters have developed within the caldera: initially of andesitic composition, around the margin of the caldera, and subsequently of dacite lava, towards the centre of the collapsed area. The effusion of these lavas was accompanied by pyroclastic eruptions of pumice fall (with an estimated volume of 1. 23 cu. miles) and pumice flows (with an estimated volume of 0. 27 cu. mile). The youngest large pumice flow, dated by the radiocarbon method, occurred 39, 050 years ago. The mineralogy of the St. andnbsp;Lucian lavas compares closely with that of typical, calcium-rich, island-arc suites. All rocks contain calcic plagioclase phenocrysts, the cores of which generally consist of bytownite while the rims, especially in the andesites and dacites, include oscillatory zones in which the calcium content commonly decreases to a minimum of about An 40. The mafic minerals in the basalts include augitic clinopyroxene, with or without orthopyroxene and olivine, whilst in the andesites, orthopyroxene (hypersthene or ferrohypersthene) predominates. The dacites are characterized by amphibole (common hornblende, oxyhornblende, or cummingtonite) and biotite, with subordinate orthopyroxene and occasional olivine phenocrysts, accompanied by 5 andndash; 15 % of large, rounded or bipyramidal phenocrysts of quartz. The youngest dacites of the Soufriandegrave;re region are unusual in that they contain phenocrysts of calcium-poor, cummingtonitic amphibole. Twenty new analyses of whole rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia are presented, and these extend over a silica range from 50 % in the earliest to 66 % in the most recent products. The suite is relatively rich in alumina (15 andndash; 19 %) and poor in alkalis (Na 2 O up to 3. 5 % K 2 O up to 1. 5 %), although by West Indian standards the potash content is high. The rocks as a whole are members of the calc-alkaline, "Pacific" series, characteristic of mobile structural belts. The silica variation diagram for St. andnbsp;Lucia illustrates the compositional heterogeneity of the basalts, and the gap (from 53 andndash; 59 %) in silica content, which also corresponds to the gap in time between the eruption of the basalts (phase 1) and the andesites (phase 2). The andesites, on the other hand, appear to be closely related to the dacites, forming a single, continuous series. A comparison of the Feandnbsp;: Mgandnbsp;: Na+K ratios reveals the close chemical similarity of the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia to those of Crater Lake, Oregon, and to the "hypersthenic" series of Hakone volcano, Japan. The Caandnbsp;: Naandnbsp;: K ratios show that the rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia contain a higher proportion of potash relative to soda and lime than most other suites of the orogenic regions. The distribution of the minor elements in ten rocks from St. andnbsp;Lucia conforms closely to that found in other West Indian and orogenic volcanic suites, with the notable exception of rubidium, which is much more abundant in the acid rocks of St. andnbsp;Lucia than in those of other suites from the Lesser Antilles. A co-variance plot of seven minor elements in the analysed samples from St. andnbsp;Lucia provides an arrangement of specimens along the abscissa which is closely parallel to the order according to silica content, and this in turn corresponds to the chronologic sequence of eruption. The basalts of St. andnbsp;Lucia are believed to have crystallized from essentially unmodified, primary magma. The occurrence in the Soufriandegrave;re region of two basalt varieties, namely porphyritic and aphyric, is explicable either {{as the result of the}} accumulation at depth of plagioclase felspar crystals, or alternatively may be attributed to the independent development two primary magmas, of tholeiitic and alumina-rich types. There is no support in the Soufriandegrave;re region for differentiation of basalt, or assimilation by primary basalt magma, on a sufficiently extensive scale to produce the observed volume and sequence of the more acid lavas. It is, therefore, proposed that the andesites and dacites of St. andnbsp;Lucia were derived largely by partial melting of local crustal material. </p...|$|R
