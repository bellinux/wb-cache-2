Using the model’s estimated parameters, the effects of Standardized Test Scores, average loans, educational <b>related</b> <b>expenditures,</b> average grants, and acceptance rate were calculated.

Taken together, these calculations indicate the degree of importance each explanatory variable has on the retention across Private Liberal Arts Colleges. This study compares the results of a cross sectional data set and a panel data set in order to properly examine the validity of the both outcomes. This analysis is intended to help Baccalaureate Private Colleges understand the factors that lead a student to drop out, as well as the factors that can enhance the college’s ability to successfully retain students...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the differential motivations of hotel owners and operators to engage in earnings management through the selective capitalisation or expensing of asset <b>related</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Research evidence has been collected via a mixed methods approach utilising 20 semi-structured interviews with key hotel management contract stakeholders in Australia and a questionnaire survey administered to hotel general managers in Australia and New Zealand. Findings - A review of the literature has resulted in an original distillation of 18 distinct earnings management motivations for hotel owners and operators. Qualitative data collected suggest an additional four motivations and that the primary motivation for hotel owners and operators to engage in earnings management stems from the two parties' desire to affect the size of the incentive management fee that is paid to hotel operators. A suggestion that operators have a greater tendency to seek to capitalise asset <b>related</b> <b>expenditures,</b> relative to owners, has been supported by both qualitative and quantitative data collected. Originality/value - This study appears to be the first to have examined the manner in which an idiosyncratic aspect of hotel governance can result in competing earnings management motivations between hotel owners and operators; the first to pursue a broad level of abstraction with respect to examining earnings management in the context of asset <b>related</b> <b>expenditure</b> capitalisation decision making; the first to assess the relative strength of earnings management motivations concerning the capitalisation or expensing of asset related expenditure; and the first to conduct earnings management research utilising a mixed methods research approach involving the conducting of face-to-face interviews as well as administration of a questionnaire survey.

The environmental <b>related</b> <b>expenditure</b> due to water pollution in 2006 is the summation of impact costs of water pollution (7. 87 million baht) and wastewater abatement costs (42. 7 million baht), which {{gives rise to the}} expense of 50. 57 millions baht.

40|$|Purpose: Enhancing {{measurement}} of innovation <b>related</b> <b>expenditure</b> in non manufacturing industries. Originality: Expanding an econometric model to measure technological innovation {{on a business}} level. Key literature / theoretical perspective: This paper calls attention to the ways innovation has traditionally been measured in various industries and different business sizes. To date, technological innovation measurements generally apply to the manufacturing industry and/or businesses with a strong Research and Development (R&D) component, which are typically large businesses. Design/methodology/approach: In order to measure innovation in other industries {{and in order to}} extend the innovation measurement in Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), we propose an enhanced version of the used Crepon, Duguet and Mairesse (CDM) structural economic model. We used the Australian Businesses Innovation Survey (IABS) 2003, which comprises a weighted sample of more than 4500 businesses. Findings: Innovation <b>Related</b> <b>Expenditure</b> makes a positive and significant contribution to technological innovation. We argue that our modified version of the CDM model provides a more accurate picture of innovation efforts in non-manufacturing industries and SMEs that do not have a strong R&D focus. Practical and Social implications: Our findings may enable policy makers to better allocate funding and resources to enhance productivity in industries and businesses not traditionally associated with innovation. 2 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Because of low {{fertility}} rates and a rising life expectancy at birth {{and at the}} age of 65, the European population is becoming older. According to the projections, presented by the European Commission, the consequence is a stagnating or even falling total population. Regarding the working age population (aged 15 – 64) a quite large fall is projected. Because the older part of the population (above 65 years) will grow both in relative and absolute terms, the dependency rate defined as people 65 years and older relative to the working age or active population will rise strongly. This means that fewer active people have to support economically more old persons. In this paper we will – based on the projections of the European Commission for population and Gross Domestic Product – investigate how pensions and other age <b>related</b> <b>expenditures</b> will develop up to 2050. Here we are looking closer on the public expenditures.
