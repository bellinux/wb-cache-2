25|$|Considerable {{research}} has been conducted about regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica. There were apparent trade routes starting in the Mexico Central Plateau, and <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast. These contacts then went on as far as Central America. These trade networks operated with various interruptions from the earliest times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).|$|E
25|$|In Durban, Arneil {{trained at}} a judo dojo (training hall) that also offered karate training. He made a {{practice}} of <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbour and asking arriving Japanese people if they practised karate; if they did, he would invite them to training at the dojo. In 1959, Arneil left South Africa, bound for Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{communications}} in ancient Mesoamerica {{have been the}} subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau, and <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as Central America. These networks operated with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).|$|E

25|$|At {{the north}} end of the BMT Fourth Avenue platforms, two {{staircases}} and one elevator go up to the main fare control area, where a turnstile bank provides access to/from the station and two staircases going up to either northern corners of Pacific Street and Fourth Avenue. The northeast corner also has an elevator <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine. A pathway connects to the rest of the complex.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} of nationalisation, a number of {{progressive}} measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility.|$|E
25|$|With the semi {{final week}} {{just around the}} corner, Week 13 saw some close matches {{including}} the opener between the Highlanders and the Hurricanes at the cake tin. The score was 22 – 16 to the Hurricanes at 80 minutes but a final minute try to Toby Morland in the corner turned things around. Nick Evans {{needed to get the}} kick over to win the game but was unsuccessful allowing the Hurricanes to win the game lucky to not have the same situation when the Hurricanes lost to the Force in week 6. The force continued their up and down season by comfortably beating the cheetahs. The Waratahs narrowly lost <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chiefs. The Brumbies pulled an upset win over the Crusaders to keep their semi final hopes alive. The Sharks dominated the lions to make sure they would at least get a home semi final. The Blues lost their third game in a row <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bulls which slimmed the chances of the Blues securing a semi final spot and helped the Bulls secure a semi final spot. The last game of the week saw the stormers easily put away the Reds.|$|E

25|$|Wildlife and waterbirds can {{be easily}} viewed from {{vehicles}} by driving on this road and stopping intermittently and <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waters edge. As {{the width of the}} drain is limited the flocks of waterfowl and other waterbirds in the drain {{can be easily}} observed from the drain's edges and this same fact makes the birds much more vulnerable to hunting as they remain in easy reach of the poacher's shotguns and the nets and traps set for them by local villagers and professional trappers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{small towns in}} the Driftless Area, {{especially}} in river valleys, at or upstream from the Mississippi. Small towns in a deep steep valley <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi are at risk every 50 to 100 years or so of a major flood, as with the wreck of Gays Mills, Wisconsin, in August 2007, or the holding of the levee in Houston, Minnesota, (on the South Fork Root River) at the same time. Metropolitan areas have flood walls (See 2007 Midwest flooding).|$|E
25|$|The station's only {{entrance}} and exit is a station {{house at the}} center of the plaza. It has a token booth, turnstile bank, and a staircase leading to a short landing above both platforms that separate into two staircases facing the opposite directions <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms themselves. The station house was renovated in 1988, which included installation of white tiles and a stained-glass artwork titled Transit Skylight by David Wilson. The station house is located on Newkirk Avenue's south side between East 15th and East 16th Streets.|$|E

25|$|On November 11, 2013, Stamkos {{suffered}} a broken tibia {{in a game}} against the Boston Bruins. He was backchecking on a play late in the second period when he was tied up with Boston defenceman Dougie Hamilton. His left skate appeared to hit the post first before his right leg crashed into it around the shin area. He tried to get up twice before <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ice in pain, grabbing his leg just above the ankle. After a brief delay, a stretcher was brought out and he was taken off to loud applause. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Stamkos entered the day tied for the NHL's lead in scoring with Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby.|$|E
25|$|A {{shopping}} arcade outside fare control {{leads to}} a staircase and elevator inside {{the south side of}} 132 East 53rd Street that go up to the northeast corner of East 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue. There is a token booth and turnstile bank leading to the passageway between the two lines, which was added in 1989. Outside fare control under the Citigroup Center, there are two stairs and an elevator. The passageway extends to the staircases and escalators <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IND platform and contains a turnstile bank in the center. In 2003, as part of efforts to ease crowding in the station, a mezzanine was added to connect the passageway to the Third Avenue end of the IND station.|$|E
25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the Man in Black's group. Jack tells the Man in Black that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill the Man in Black because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the Man in Black do not matter because he is <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the Man in Black lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the Man in Black predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making the Man in Black mortal again. During a prolonged fight, the Man in Black stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the Man in Black in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails. The two profess their love for each other and Kate leaves with Sawyer while Hurley and Ben follow Jack back to the pool.|$|E

500|$|The castle {{prison was}} found to still be in a very bad condition. The commissioners noted how the prison had [...] "only one window, which is one foot wide and in a recess.

It leads to a hole <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the building, which is always inaccessible for cleaning, but which until six years ago had a drain from it to the moat; the air draws up from it into the passage and the room.

500|$|When {{asked about}} his lyrics {{commanding}} a woman to [...] "do it doggy style" [...] in his song [...] "Do It Do It", Weaver stated that the lyrics are a reflection of his background and audience, and not necessarily {{how he feels about}} others. Weaver reflected on the song [...] "Saturday Night" [...] as being about [...] "my 17 year old Saturday night" [...] which consisted of <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Parkside Inn, drinking, and [...] "watching the bitches on the corner" [...] and that the song was not meant to be taken literally, but that he [...] "did come home once with a girl and I forgot my key and my mom was pissed off, but she didn't pull a gun; she's never owned a gun in her life".|$|E
500|$|An {{aviation}} company owner and {{patron of the}} Maharishi's, Kershi Cambata (K. S. Khambatta), flew two helicopters to Rishikesh to take the Maharishi and his guests for rides, for the publicity value, even though the flights required the transportation of fuel by truck to Rishikesh. [...] McCartney asked Lennon {{why he was so}} eager {{to be the one to}} go with the Maharishi on his helicopter ride, to which Lennon replied, [...] "I thought he'd slip me the answer." [...] On another occasion, an Italian newsreel company filmed the Maharishi and many students, including the Beatles and other musicians, <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river while the musicians sang standards such as [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] and [...] "You Are My Sunshine". One evening, when the moon was full, the Maharishi arranged for everyone to cruise on the Ganges in two barges. The trip started with the chanting of Vedas by two pandits, but soon the musicians brought out their instruments. The Beatles sang Donovan's songs, while Love and Donovan sang Beatles songs, and Horn played flute.|$|E
50|$|With Donovan McNabb <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> injury, <b>the</b> Eagles {{called on}} Jeff Garcia <b>to</b> lead <b>the</b> team.
