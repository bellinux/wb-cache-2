He was then hired by the CIA in 1958 as an interpreter and translator, as he knew five tribal languages. Bill Young's knowledge of the Golden Triangle region, command of indigenous languages, and recent military experience made him an ideal candidate for service in the CIA's paramilitary wing - then known as the Special Operations Division. The Agency's rueful joke concerning Bill Young stated {{that he had an}} American exterior to disguise his Lahu interior. The very cultural background that made Young so valuable to the CIA would also become the font of their problems with him. He was stubbornly independent, and tended to take orders only from Bill Lair. In Lahu fashion, he was not strict in observing a punctual <b>duty</b> <b>schedule.</b> He did not always observe the niceties of calendar or watch, which led to complaints from other CIA case officers. Young was known to have a legion of female admirers, and a penchant for the occasional French leave, thus irritating his superiors. Additionally, his personality clashed with that of coworker Pat Landry as they worked together at the Royal Thai Air Force Base at Udorn. All of these scotched his chance for which he seemed ideally suited, that of CIA adviser to Hmong General Vang Pao.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in the level of fatigue induced by high-speed maritime craft operation between the day- and night-shift officers. The demographic and work-related factors that contribute to fatigue were also explored. A total of 93 high-speed maritime craft officers participated in the survey, of whom 35 worked a day shift (Mean age= 48. 3 years) and 58 worked a night shift (Mean age= 45. 8 years). Fatigue experience was measured with the Chinese version of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (SOFI-C) at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the work shift. Information on age, work experience, perceived voyage difficulty and <b>duty</b> <b>schedule</b> was obtained. The study found that the night-shift officers seemed to manifest an overall higher level of perceived fatigue than the day-shift officers, while the day-shift officers demonstrated a fatigue carry-over effect across the two workdays. Besides the shift pattern, age, experience in operating high-speed maritime craft and perceived voyage difficulty were the significant factors contributing to the officers’ fatigue experience. The finding that the fatigue experience associated with high-speed maritime craft operation has a rapid and accumulative nature suggests that different occupational safety and health guidelines should be devised for these two groups of officers.

40|$|Study Objectives: To {{parameterize}} and validate a {{model to}} estimate average sleep times for long-haul aviation pilots during layovers following travel across multiple time zones. The model equations {{were based on a}} weighted distribution of domicile- and local-time sleepers, and included algorithms to account for sleep loss and circadian re-synchronization. Design: Sleep times were collected from participants under normal commercial operating conditions using diaries and wrist activity monitors. Participants: Participants included a total of 306 long-haul pilots (113 captains, 120 first officers, and 73 second officers). Measurement and Results: The model was parameterized based on the average sleep/wake times observed during international flight patterns from Australia to London and Los Angeles (global R 2 = 0. 72). The parameterized model was validated against the average sleep/wake times observed during flight patterns from Australia to London (r 2 = 0. 85), Los Angeles (r 2 = 0. 79), New York (r 2 = 0. 80), and Johannesburg (r 2 = 0. 73). Goodness-of-fit was poorer when the parameterized model equations were used to predict the variance across the sleep/wake cycles of individual pilots (R 2 = 0. 42, 0. 35, 0. 31, and 0. 28 for the validation flight patterns, respectively), in part because of substantial inter-individual variability in sleep timing and duration. Conclusions: It is possible to estimate average sleep times during layovers in international patterns with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Models of this type could form the basis of a stand-alone application to estimate the likelihood that a given <b>duty</b> <b>schedule</b> provides pilots, on average, with an adequate opportunity to sleep...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{research}} related to human fatigue in the aviation industry has focussed on long-haul pilots, but short-haul pilots also experience elevated levels of fatigue. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the impact of early start times on the amount of sleep obtained prior to duty and on fatigue levels at the start of duty. Seventy short-haul pilots collected data regarding their <b>duty</b> <b>schedule</b> and sleep/wake behaviour for at least two weeks. Data were collected using self-report duty/sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors. Mixed-effects regression analyses were used to examine the effects of duty start time (04 : 00 – 10 : 00 h) on (i) the total amount of sleep obtained in the 12 h prior to the start of duty and (ii) self-rated fatigue level at the start of duty. Both analyses indicated significant main effects of duty start time. In particular, the amount of sleep obtained in the 12 h prior to duty was lowest for duty periods that commenced between 04 : 00 and 05 : 00 h (i. e. 5. 4 h), and greatest for duty periods that commenced between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 h (i. e. 6. 6 h). These data indicate that approximately 15 min of sleep is lost for every hour that the start of duty is advanced prior to 09 : 00 h. In addition, self-rated fatigue at the start of duty was highest for duty periods that commenced between 04 : 00 and 05 : 00 h, and lowest for duty periods that commenced between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 h. Airlines should implement a fatigue risk management system (FRMS) for short-haul pilots required to work early-morning shifts. One component of the FRMS should be focussed on the production of ‘fatigue-friendly’ rosters. A second component of the FRMS should be focussed on training pilots to optimise sleep opportunities, to identify circumstances where the likelihood of fatigue is elevated, and to manage the risks associated with fatigue-related impairment...|$|E
40|$|The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN), once deployed, is usually expected to operate for months even years. In the WSN, each individual sensor node is typically equipped with small batteries which offer only {{a limited amount of}} energy. Hence, numerous energy-efficiency schemes have been developed for the WSN, aiming to help the WSN to achieve long lifetime under the stringent constraint of energy supply. These energy-efficiency schemes can reduce energy consumption, but they cannot address the issue of unbalanced energy consumption and energy replenishment in the WSN. In practice, different sensor nodes could have different initial energy supplies and/or play different roles in the network; consequently, some nodes may deplete their energy faster than the others. In such cases, the lifetime of the network becomes determined by the energy-bottleneck nodes who deplete their energy the fastest. To address this issue, the ideas of energy-balancing and lifetime-balancing have been proposed and energy-balancing and lifetime-balancing schemes have been developed for the MAC and routing layers of the WSN. However, there have been very few efforts on studying how to apply the idea to multiple layers of the WSN simultaneously and the effectiveness of such an integrated solution. To fill this gap, this thesis presents an integrated design, which includes lifetime-balancing schemes for the application, routing and MAC layers. Specifically, in the application layer where the sensing duty should be assigned to sensor nodes, we present a scheme in which leader nodes coordinate the sensing <b>duty</b> <b>schedule</b> among the sensor nodes based on their estimated nodal lifetime. In the routing layer, the routing metric is calculated based on both nodal lifetime and required end-to-end delay. In the MAC layer, we adopts the LB-MAC protocol, which balances nodal lifetime by adjusting the MAC parameters. Our design has been simulated in Network Simulator 2 (NS 2) and compared with other solutions which do not apply lifetime-balancing idea or only applying the idea in some but not all of the three layers. The evaluation results have shown that our integrated design prolongs the network lifetime more effectively. Also, the integrated design achieves better performance in terms of data delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and wasted energy...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Program in Neuroscience, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} aims {{to investigate}} {{some of the}} complex interactions between sleep loss, workload, cognition, and physiology. In order {{to examine the effects}} of workload on fatigue (operationally defined as a state of reduced alertness) and performance, commercial airline pilots flew two <b>duty</b> <b>schedules</b> in a high-fidelity, moving-base simulator. The <b>duty</b> <b>schedules</b> were of equal duty duration and start time, but had differing levels of workload related to the number of flight segments flown. The higher workload condition, with more flight segments, had higher levels of fatigue, as shown through subjective measurements and through impairment in vigilant attention. To further investigate these effects, we conducted three laboratory studies. First, we present the validation of a tool used to measure impairment in vigilant attention related to sleep loss and fatigue. Second, we compared this performance impairment with measures of heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting autonomic nervous system activity. Performance impairments between and within test sessions during sleep deprivation were not reflected by changes in HRV. Last, we present data pertaining to the effect of sleep loss on additional components of cognition. Subjects took repeated administrations of six variants of a Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), each designed to omit cognitive components potentially involved in the task, including visual search, spatial memory, paired associate learning, and motor memory. During 38 hours of sleep deprivation, all task variants showed performance impairment, regardless of which cognitive components were omitted. Together, these studies provided evidence concerning the underlying mechanisms of the sleep deprivation-induced impairment. Because the HRV measures did not vary in tandem with the performance impairment, the underlying mechanism may not be global in nature, that is, not general cognitive slowing or wake-state instability. While not all components of the DSST were controlled for, the presence of the sleep deprivation-induced performance impairment on all variants makes it less plausible that sleep deprivation causes deficits to specific cognitive functions. Instead, the physiological mechanism by which sleep deprivation induces cognitive impairments may be local or task-specific, such as the use-dependent degradation of the specific neural processes subserving the task.

Thus, maximum lifetime can be obtained by identifying the optimal covers and allocate them an operation time.

Additionally, Branch-and-Cut based on Benders' decomposition and Constraint Programming approaches are used to solve the pricing subproblem. The approach is tested on randomly generated instances.
