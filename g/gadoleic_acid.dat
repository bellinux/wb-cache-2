In this study, some {{physical and chemical properties}} of the seed and also fatty acid composition of seed oil were determined. Oil content of the sample was determined by soxhlet apparatus as 26. 10 % in dried sample. Fatty acid composition was analyzed by GC-MS and seven fatty acids were identified and their ratios were determined in this seed oil. The main fatty acid was determined as α-eleostearic (45. 60 %). The other fatty acids were palmitic (3. 69 %), stearic (28. 00 %), oleic (12. 45 %), linoleic (8. 90 %), arachidic (0. 71 %) and <b>gadoleic</b> <b>acids</b> (0. 65 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Poppy seeds {{have a high}} {{nutritive value}} and are used as a food {{and a source of}} edible oil. This oil is a rich source of {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids. It is known that polyunsaturated fatty acids present not only basic nutriments for human body, but its taking to the organism is very important in term of protection against cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks and many inflammatory diseases. The goal {{of the study was to}} determine lipid content and fatty acids composition in eight selected poppy genotypes grown in experimental fields of the Plant Production Research Centre Piešťany – Research and Breeding Station at Malý Šariš (Slovak Republic) in two years. Seed oils were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-FID) from prepared methylesters of fatty acids. The highest lipid content in 2007 was detected for genotype Opál (49. 9 %). In 2009, genotype ZB- 6 contained the highest lipid content (50. 1 %). Linoleic acid was dominant fatty acid in all analyzed poppy oils. Its highest level contained the genotype ZB- 5 (68. 1 %) in 2007 and ZB- 1 (66. 5 %) in 2009. Other major fatty acids were palmitic and oleic acids. As minority fatty acids were presented stearic, alpha-linolenic and palmitoleic acids. Myristic, arachidic and <b>gadoleic</b> <b>acids</b> were observed in trace amounts. Furthermore, the effect of year of cultivation on the fatty acids content in poppy seed oils was examined by Student t-test and appropriate non-parametric Mann-Whitney test...|$|R
40|$|Particulate (15, 000 g) {{fractions}} {{from developing}} seeds of honesty (Lunaria annua L.) and mustard (Sinapis alba L.) synthesize radioactive very long chain monounsaturated fatty <b>acids</b> (<b>gadoleic,</b> erucic, and nervonic) from [1 - 14 C]oleoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA or from oleoyl-CoA and [2 - 14 C]malonyl-CoA. The very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids are rapidly channeled to triacylglycerois and other acyl lipids without intermediate accumulation of their CoA thioesters. When [1 - 14 C]oleoyl-CoA {{is used as}} the radioactive substrate, phosphatidylcholines and other phospholipids are most extensively radiolabeled by oleoyl moieties rather than by very long chain monounsaturated acyl moieties. When [2 - 14 C]malonyl-CoA is used as the radioactive substrate, no radioactive oleic acid is formed and the newly synthesized very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids are extensively incorporated into phosphatidylcholines and other phospholipids as well as triacylglycerols. The pattern of labeling of the key intermediates of the Kennedy pathway, e. g. lysophosphatidic acids, phosphatidic acids, and diacylglycerols by the newly synthesized very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids {{is consistent with the}} operation of this pathway in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols...|$|R

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of the seed oil from the yellow fruit of Opuntia ficus-indica widely grown in Sicily shows several distinctive features. The oil obtained comprises significant amounts of vaccenic acid along with several other unsaturated fatty acids showing several health benefits, including linolenic, trans- 13 -octadecenoic, gondoic, 7 Z, 10 Z-hexadecadienoic, and <b>gadoleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The economic analysis shows the significant advantage of carrying out the extraction from fruits considered unfit for consumption. Practical applications: The fatty acid composition of Sicilian Opuntia ficus-indica seed oil {{is similar to that}} of fruits grown in Tunisia, while it has a completely different profile than the OFI fruits grown in Algeria and Morocco. Like the oil obtained in Tunisia, the Sicilian oil has a higher vaccenic acid content, but it comprises significant amounts of other unsaturated fatty acids showing highly beneficial health properties. Extracted from fruits considered unfit for consumption, its production generates â 8 ̆ 2 ¬ 1220 additional revenues per tonne of unfit fruit thereby significantly improving the economics of OFI processing companies. The oil has several potential applications which go beyond cosmetics, especially as nutraceutical ingredient. With increasing usage and market expansion, we predict that cold press extraction will be replaced by advanced extraction methods such as extraction with supercritical CO 2 maximizing for example the biophenol amount in the oil.

40|$|Peanut, a high-oil crop {{with about}} 50 % oil content, is either crushed for oil or used as edible products. Fatty acid {{composition}} determines the oil quality which has high relevance to consumer health, flavor, and shelf life of commercial products. In {{addition to the}} major fatty acids, oleic acid (C 18 : 1) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) accounting for about 80 % of peanut oil, the six other fatty acids namely palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), stearic acid (C 18 : 0), arachidic acid (C 20 : 0), <b>gadoleic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 20 : 1), behenic acid (C 22 : 0), and lignoceric acid (C 24 : 0) are accounted for the rest 20 %. To determine the genetic basis and to improve further understanding on effect of FAD 2 genes on these fatty acids, two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations namely S-population (high oleic line ‘SunOleic 97 R’ × low oleic line ‘NC 94022 ’) and T-population (normal oleic line ‘Tifrunner’ × low oleic line ‘GT-C 20 ’) were developed. Genetic maps with 206 and 378 marker loci for the S- and the T-population, respectively were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. As a result, a total of 164 main-effect (M-QTLs) and 27 epistatic (E-QTLs) QTLs associated with the minor fatty acids were identified with 0. 16 % to 40. 56 % phenotypic variation explained (PVE). Thirty four major QTLs (> 10 % of PVE) mapped on five linkage groups and 28 clusters containing more than three QTLs were also identified. These {{results suggest that the}} major QTLs with large additive effects would {{play an important role in}} controlling composition of these minor fatty acids in addition to the oleic and linoleic acids in peanut oil. The interrelationship among these fatty acids should be considered while breeding for improved peanut genotypes with good oil quality and desired fatty acid composition...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has determined oil, fatty acid and sterol {{contents of the}} Tunisian Pistacia lentiscus (Lentisc) fruits during maturation. Low oil accumulation was observed during the first 35 days after the fruiting (DAF) date (from 1. 83 % to 2. 57 %). After that, two phases were distinguished (35 th until the 60 th and 105 th to the 145 th DAF), where the rate of oil accumulation increased significantly. At the last stage of maturation, the lentisc fruits had {{the highest percentage of}} lipid content, 42. 54 %. The changing profile of fatty acids during maturation had been marked mainly by an increase in oleic acid content (from 19. 49 % to 50. 72 %) paralleling a decrease in linoleic acid content (from 42. 5 % to 21. 75 %). At the 15 th DAF, the alpha-linolenic acid was found with a maximum of 13. 81 %. At full maturity, the main fatty acids were oleic acid, followed by palmitic and linoleic acid. Other fatty acids were present in trace proportions, such as palmitoleic, stearic, linolenic, <b>gadoleic</b> and arachidic <b>acid.</b> In all stages of ripening only four sterols were identified and quantified. b-Sitosterol was the major 4 -desmethylsterol in samples tested, followed by campesterol. Cholesterol and stigmasterol were detected in trace amounts. During the first stage of ripening, the amount of total sterols was about 5. 19 / 100 g of oil. It decreased to 0. 43 / 100 g in the last stage. Sitosterol and campesterol showed nearly the same profile during the ripening of P. lentiscus fruit which could be linked to the relation between these compounds during their biosynthesis.

40|$|Horse gram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc. ] seeds {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of fatty acids, flavonols and minerals should provide government, public and private organizations with a nutritious and healthy food for use by malnourished and food deprived people worldwide. Seeds from seven horse gram accessions, geographically adapted to Griffin, GA, USA were analyzed for fatty acid, flavonol, and mineral concentrations using gas chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, respectively. Significant year effects occurred for stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidic, <b>gadoleic,</b> and lignoceric <b>acids.</b> Oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid ranged from 8. 9 %– 16. 8 %, 40. 3 %– 45. 6 %, and 11. 6 %– 14. 3 %, respectively, as percent of total fatty acids measured (total oil ranged from 2. 32 % to 2. 87 %). Seed concentrations of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol ranged from 0 – 36 μg/g DW, 0 – 27 μg/g DW, and 240 – 316 μg/g DW, respectively and the only year effect was observed for kaempferol among the horse gram accessions. Year effects were found for Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, and S. Mean concentrations of macrominerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, and S) and microminerals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) ranged from 1. 3 – 14 mg/g DW, and 1. 0 – 95. 0 μg/g DW, respectively. Several correlations were observed among several fatty acids, flavonols, and minerals. The mono-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid correlated significantly with linoleic acid (r = − 0. 64), arachidic acid (r = − 0. 61), Ca (r = 0. 50) and Zn (r = 0. 51, all at P < 0. 01). The flavonol, myricetin correlated significantly with quercetin (r = 0. 92, P < 0. 0001), while quercetin correlated with Ca (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 0001) and kaempferol correlated with Mg (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 01). Several mineral correlations were found including Fe with K (r = 0. 66) and Mg (r = 0. 56, both at P < 0. 01). These seven horse gram accessions {{can be used in}} breeding programs to facilitate the production of superior cultivars with favorable fatty acid profiles, flavonol content, and mineral compositions...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of corn oil {{can be altered}} to meet consumer demands for “healthful” fats (i. e., lower saturates and higher monounsaturates). To this end, a survey of 418 corn hybrids and 98 corn inbreds grown in Iowa was done to determine the fatty acid composition of readily-available, adapted, elite corn breeding materials. These materials are those used in commercial hybrid production. Eighty-seven hybrids grown in France (18 of which also were grown in lowa) were analyzed to determine environmental influence on fatty acid content. The parents of the hybrids and the inbreds were classified in one of four heterotic groups: Lancaster, Stiff Stalk, non-Lancaster/non-Stiff Stalk, and Other. t-Tests and correlation analyses were performed with statistical significance accepted at a level ofP≤ 0. 05. The findings showed {{a wide range of}} fatty acid profiles present in adapted, elite corn breeding materials with ranges for each fatty acid as follows: palmitic acid, 6. 7 – 16. 5 %; palmitoleic acid, 0. 0 – 1. 2 %; stearic acid, 0. 7 – 6. 6 %; oleic acid, 16. 2 – 43. 8 %; linoleic acid, 39. 5 – 69. 5 %; linolenic acid, 0. 0 – 3. 1 %; and arachidic acid, 0. 0 – 1. 0 %. Small amounts of myristic acid, margaric acid, and <b>gadoleic</b> <b>acid</b> also were found. Three lines had total saturates of 9. 1 % or less. Thirty-six of thet-tests involving hybrids showed significant differences among heterotic groups. There were small but significant correlations among protein, starch and oil content and the amounts of several fatty acids. Results from the corn grown in France vs. lowa demonstrated a large environmental effect that overwhelmed the genetic differences among lines. This study shows that for some attributes, a breeding program involving adapted corn breeding materials might produce the desired oil. Other types of oil (such as high-oleic) would have to be produced in a different manner, for example, by a breeding program with exotic breeding materials...|$|E
40|$|It is {{established}} that virtually {{every part of}} the Moringa oleifera tree (leaves, stem, bark, root, flowers, seeds, and seeds oil) are beneficial in some way with great benefits to human being. The tree is rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals. All Moringa oleifera food products have a very high nutritional value. They are eaten directly as food, as supplements, and as seasonings as well as fodder for animals. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of seeds particle size on oil extraction using chemical method (solvent extraction). Also, to compare Moringa oleifera seeds oil properties which are produced chemically (solvent extraction) and mechanically (mechanical press). The Moringa oleifera seeds were grinded, sieved, and the oil was extracted using soxhlet extraction technique with n-Hexane using three different size of sample (2 mm, 1 mm, and 500 μm). The average oil yield was 36. 1 %, 40. 80 %, and 41. 5 % for 2 mm, 1 mm, and 500 μm particle size, respectively. The properties of Moringa oleifera seeds oil were: density of 873 kg/m 3, and 880 kg/m 3, kinematic viscosity of 42. 2 mm 2 /s and 9. 12 mm 2 /s for the mechanical and chemical method, respectively. pH, cloud point and pour point were same for oil produced with both methods which is 6, 18 °C and 12 °C, respectively. For the fatty acids, the oleic acid is present with high percentage of 75. 39 %, and 73. 60 % from chemical and mechanical method, respectively. Other fatty acids are present as well in both samples which are (<b>Gadoleic</b> <b>acid,</b> Behenic acid, Palmitic acid) which are with lower percentage of 2. 54 %, 5. 83 %, and 5. 73 %, respectively in chemical method oil, while they present as 2. 40 %, 6. 73 %, and 6. 04 %, respectively in mechanical method oil. In conclusion, the results showed that both methods can produce oil with high quality. Moringa oleifera seeds oil appear to be an acceptable good source for oil rich in oleic acid which is equal to olive oil quality, that can be consumed in Malaysia where the olive oil is imported with high prices. In the same time cultivation of Moringa oleifera tree {{is considered to be a}} new source of income for the country and give more job opportunities...|$|E
