5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 {{and he never}} again {{averaged}} over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pavilion.|$|E

5|$|Mining was {{challenging}} as the ore {{was distributed}} in an uneven manner and digging was made slow by permafrost. As a result, some miners chose {{to buy and}} sell claims, building up huge investments and letting others do the work. To accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes and at their end Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon River. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house around 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. Despite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly gambling and <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saloons. The Native Hän people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush, being moved into a reserve {{to make way for the}} stampeders, and many died.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the risks}} {{especially}} in adolescents, of cognitive impairments and possible {{irreversible brain damage}} associated with binge drinking, urgent action has been recommended.

25|$|Despite {{the central}} place {{of alcohol and}} heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} way of life at that time, upon {{his return to the}} island Faragher took up abstinence.

Also at this time his poetry expanded from the romantic and lyrical to include more contemplative and sacred topics.|$|E

25|$|Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford– {{former members}} of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the {{original}} leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, {{in the course of his}} editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a memory hole. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.|$|E

It is not known, however, whether these potential associations are caused by the IVF procedure in itself, by adverse obstetric outcomes associated with IVF, by the genetic origin of the children or by yet unknown IVF-associated causes.

25|$|Based on {{the number}} of {{children}} with parents meeting the DSM-V criteria for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, in 1996 there were an estimated 26.8 million children of alcoholics (COAs) in the United States of which 11 million were under the age of 18. As of 1988, it was estimated that 76 million Americans, about 43% of the U.S. adult population, have been exposed to alcoholism or problem <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family, either having grown up with an alcoholic, having an alcoholic blood relative, or marrying an alcoholic. While growing up, nearly one in five adult Americans (18%) lived with an alcoholic. In 1992, it was estimated that one in eight adult American drinkers were alcoholics or experienced problems as consequences of their alcohol use.|$|E
25|$|The Glasgow Subway and its {{adjacent}} public {{houses are}} {{the focal point}} of a pub crawl known as the Subcrawl. Participants buy an all day Discovery ticket, disembark at each of the 15 stations and have a drink in the nearest bar. Two of the stations (West Street and Shields Road) are not very near a pub or bar; however, Subcrawls are popular amongst young Glaswegians and especially students at the city's universities. During the journey between stations, participants are usually required to stand in the train and not hold onto any supports, known as Subsurfing. A subcrawl usually takes a whole day, and completing a crawl (<b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same pub one started in) is regarded as quite an achievement.|$|E

25|$|Jealousy {{and hatred}} between Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney, the other ace pitcher on the team, broke out into {{violence}} in the clubhouse. Radbourn was faulted as the initiator of the fight, and was suspended without pay after a poor outing on July 16, having been accused of deliberately losing the game by lobbing soft pitches over the plate. But on July 22, Sweeney had been drinking {{before the start of}} the game and continued <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dugout between innings. Despite being obviously intoxicated, Sweeney managed to make it to the seventh inning with a 6–2 lead: when Bancroft attempted to relieve him with the change pitcher, Sweeney verbally abused him before being ejected and storming out of the park, leaving Providence with only eight players. With only two men to cover the outfield, they lost the game.|$|E
25|$|As a beer style, saison {{began as}} a pale ale brewed in the cooler, less active months in {{farmhouse}}s in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, and stored for <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer months. These farmhouse beers would have been of a lower ABV than modern saisons—around 3 to 3.5% ABV on average, rising in the early 20th century to between 4.5 and 6.5% ABV. They were served to farm workers who were entitled to up to five litres each workday. Brewing outside the summer months was common for all brewers before the discovery of refrigeration, due to {{the likelihood of the}} beer spoiling while fermenting in the summer, the height of airborne bacteria activity. Farmers possibly also brewed during the cooler months to provide work for their permanent staff during the quieter period. After brewing, the beer was stored until the summer when the main consumers would be seasonal workers ("saisonniers").|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{released}} {{a study in}} October 2011 that showed that in the United States binge drinking costs society $223 billion a year, which amounts to $2 per drink. These costs include health care costs for alcohol-related issues, including liver cirrhosis, loss of work productivity, property damage due to drunk driving, and expenditures related to criminal acts. Overall, 11.9% of binge drinkers drove during or within 2 hours of their most recent binge drinking episode. Those drinking in licensed establishments (bars, clubs, and restaurants) accounted for 54.3% of these driving episodes. Significant independent risk factors for driving after binge drinking included male gender (AOR=1.75); being aged 35–54 or ≥55 years compared to 18–34 years (AOR=1.58 and 2.37, respectively); and drinking in bars or clubs compared to <b>drinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> respondent's home (AOR=7.81). Drivers who drank most of their alcohol in licensed establishments consumed an average of 8.1 drinks, and 25.7% of them consumed ≥10 drinks.|$|E
