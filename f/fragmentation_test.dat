A common feature of natural fibers is a much higher variability of mechanical properties.

Elementary flax fibers of different gauge lengths are tested by single fiber tension in order to obtain the stress-strain response and strength and failure strain distributions. The applicability of single fiber <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test</b> for flax fiber failure strain and strength characterization is considered.

Various methods exist to <b>test</b> sperm DNA <b>fragmentation</b> such as the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), the sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay and the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the value of measuring sperm DNA fragmentation in predicting chance of ongoing pregnancy with IVF or ICSI. Out of 658 unique studies, 30 had extractable data and were thus included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the sperm DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>tests</b> had a reasonable to good sensitivity. A wide variety of other factors may also affect the IVF/ICSI outcome, reflected by limited to very low specificity. The constructed hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve indicated a fair discriminatory capacity of the TUNEL assay (area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 66 to 0. 74) and Comet assay (AUC of 0. 73; 95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 97). The SCSA and the SCD test had poor predictive capacity. Importantly, for the TUNEL assay, SCD test and Comet assay, meta-regression showed no differences in predictive value between IVF and ICSI. For the SCSA meta-regression indicated the predictive values for IVF and ICSI were different. The present review suggests that current sperm DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>tests</b> have limited capacity to predict the chance of pregnancy in the context of MAR. Furthermore, sperm DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>tests</b> have little or no difference in predictive value between IVF and ICSI. At this moment, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of sperm DNA <b>fragmentation</b> <b>tests</b> in couples undergoing MAR both for the prediction of pregnancy and for the choice of treatment.

40|$|A Boundary Element {{analysis}} of micromechanical elastic {{fields in the}} single-fiber <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test</b> is presented in this thesis. The work carried out is roughly divided in two main tasks: {{the development of the}} BE code and the numerical simulation of the single-fiber <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test.</b> The numerical study is primarily concerned with the {{analysis of}} the initiation and growth of a debond crack along the fiber-matrix interface in the single fiber <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test,</b> although different configurations in which the crack propagates through the matrix have also been considered. The asymptotic behavior of the near-tip singular elastic solutions in the fiber cracks, the interface cracks and the matrix cracks are studied. Additionally, asymptotic behavior of the Energy Release Rate {{for a wide range of}} debond lengths is analyzed. Firstly, the numerical analysis is performed in the framework of the two linear elastic models of interface cracks, open model and frictionless contact model, and a discussion of their adequacy based on the numerical results presented is given. Finally, a frictional contact model is employed to elucidate the influence that the friction between the debond crack faces may have in the near-tip singular elastic solutions and crack propagation. Therefore, a Boundary Element code has been developed which allows the elastic analysis of axially symmetric bodies to be carried out, permitting the definition of multiple solids bonded or in contact, taking into account the residual stresses developed during the curing of the samples and allowing non conforming meshes to be used in the interfaces and contact zones. Moreover, a novel extremely accurate integration technique has been developed to allow the near-tip singular elastic solutions to be precisely obtained. Godk√§nd; 2007; 20071107 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{analysis}} of the single-fibre <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test,</b> a modified variational analysis, based on the principle of minimum complementary energy, has been derived to describe the stress states around breaks in a single fibre embedded in an infinite matrix.

The stress profiles along the interface between the fibre and matrix are presented and compared with the prediction by the variational approach presented by Nairn. The predictions are also compared with the results from finite element analysts and good agreement is obtained While the present analysis is more accurate than existing analytical models, it leads to very simple final expressions. Thus, it is convenient to be used for data reduction of the single-fibre <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test</b> results.

The {{effect of}} interfiber {{distance}} on the interfacial properties in two dimensional multi-E-glass fiber/epoxy resin composites {{has been investigated}} using <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test.</b> In additions, {{the effect of the}} fiber surface treatment on the interfacial properties has been studied. We found that the interfacial shear strength decreased with the decreasing of the interfiber distance at the range of under 50 ¬µm and the extent of the decreasing was more serious as the increasing of the number of adjacent fiber. This is probably that the interface between the fiber and the resin was damaged by the adjacent fiber breaks and the damage increased with closing the interfiber spacing and the number of adjacent fiber. We can guess from this interfacial shear strength in real composites is much smaller than that of multi-fiber fragmentation sample with touched fiber. It was seen that the interfacial shear strengths saturated when the interfiber distance was over 50 ¬µm, the ones were saturated regardless of fiber surface treatment and the ones were in close agreement with those of the single fiber <b>fragmentation</b> <b>test.</b> Finally, the interfacial shear strength evaluated using two dimensional fragmentation tests are shown as real values in-site regardless of fiber surface treatment, interfiber distance and existing of matrix cracks...|$|E
