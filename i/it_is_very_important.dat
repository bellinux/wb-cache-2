25|$|X-ray {{radiation}} is ionizing radiation, thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile C-Arm, which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms {{work on a}} much higher energy level, which induces higher dose.

25|$|For {{structural}} steel seismic design based on Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to assess {{ability of a}} structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the inelastic range. A measure of this ability is ductility, which may be observed in a material itself, in a structural element, or to a whole structure.|$|E
25|$|Because file {{names have}} to be {{exchanged}} between software environments (think network file transfer, file system storage, backup and file synchronization software, configuration management, data compression and archiving, etc.), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> not to lose file name information between applications. This led to wide adoption of Unicode as a standard for encoding file names, although legacy software might be non-Unicode-aware.|$|E

25|$|Dominance: {{as already}} mentioned, in this regime the enemy forces are equal. You can gain {{the upper hand}} through the proper {{selection}} and application teams. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{to be aware of}} the terrain on the battlefield and take into account certain weather conditions. In other words, use the single-player experience. Your goal - to capture and retain most of the victory points.|$|E

Rotary cutters revolutionized quiltmaking when they appeared in late 1970s. A rotary cutter offers even the shakiest of hands the ability to produce perfect, even slices and minimizes the chance of error.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{for family}} members and health care {{professionals}} {{to be aware of}} natural movements also known as Lazarus sign or Lazarus reflex that can occur on a brain-dead person whose organs have been kept functioning by life support. The living cells that can cause these movements are not living cells from the brain or brain stem, these cells come from the spinal cord. Sometimes these body movements can cause false hope for the family members.|$|E
25|$|Pythagoras {{was also}} {{credited}} with devising the tetractys, the triangular figure of four rows which {{add up to}} the perfect number, ten. As a mystical symbol, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to the worship of the Pythagoreans who would swear oaths by it.|$|R

25|$|Skyglow is made {{considerably}} {{worse when}} clouds are present. While this {{has no effect}} on astronomical observations (which are not possible at visible wavelengths under cloud cover), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> in the context of ecological light pollution. Since cloudy nights in artificially lit areas can be up to ten thousand times brighter than in natural areas, any organisms that are affected by sky glow (e.g. zooplankton and fish that visually prey on them) {{are much more likely to}} have their ordinary behavior disturbed on cloudy nights.|$|E
25|$|Mahavamsa -The Mahavamsa ("Great Chronicle") is a {{historical}} poem written in the Pali language of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of Kalinga (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361). As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the Indian subcontinent. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> in dating the consecration of Ashoka.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{that the}} stirrup be the correct width for the boot. A stirrup {{that is too}} narrow will {{increase}} the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup {{makes it harder for}} a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through. It is generally suggested that the stirrup be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|E

25|$|The {{attractiveness}} of a constructed wetlands solution {{lies in its}} relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> that the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> that the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{to have a}} {{properly}} formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist {{play an important role}} to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.|$|E
