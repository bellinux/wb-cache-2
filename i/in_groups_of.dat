5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> two to three, and join pods {{for short periods}} of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart.

METHODS: A total of 92 eyes in 55 cases respectively suffering from preproliferative diabetic retinopathy(PPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) were treated with panretinal photocoagulation. The fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) and color photograph were taken 3, 6, 12 mo after the treatment. For those cases with remaining new vessels and non-perfusion areas, the treatment was complemented with further photocoagulation. The follow-up period was 3 - 12 mo. RESULTS: After treating with panretinal photocoagulation, visual acuity were improved or maintained in 23 eyes(77 %) and decreased in 7 eyes(23 %) <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> PPDR; Visual acuity were improved or maintained in 44 eyes(71 %) and decreased in 18 eyes(29 %) <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> PDR.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background : Nutrition {{extension}} {{is one of}} {{the approach}} efforts to increase knowledge in order to gain good behavior. Through this extension, we expected mother of under five years child would understood and comprehended as well as had a willing and could implement what she was advised, so that she could took care of under five years child with underweight nutrition to become better nutrition. Purpose: To study about the changing of knowledge and attitude of mother with undernourished of under-five years child after got intervention of extension for 3 months <b>of</b> between two <b>groups</b> got leaflet and didn't get leaflet. Methods: This applied research applied quasi experiment research design. Population is mother having undernourished of under five years child and mother age ranges from 18 - 45 years, totally 176 samples. <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> treatment got extension package for 3 months and given leaflet to be studied <b>in</b> house. <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> control was participated extension package for 3 months, but they weren’t given leaflet, and leaflet was given after this research completed. Results : After followed extension package during 3 months, samples showed improvement for mother’s knowledge as 11. 4 % <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> treatment and 10. 4 % <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> control. Statististically by using Chi quadrate test, there were a significance difference (p= 0. 00) for mother’s knowledge before and after research <b>in</b> both <b>group</b> <b>of</b> research. There is a changing for mother’s attitude <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> treatment as 28. 1 % and 16. 1 % <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> control. By using chi square test we found significance difference (p= 0, 021) on mother’s attitude <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> treatment before and after extension for 3 month, while <b>in</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> control there was no significance difference (p= 0. 187). Conclusions : Leaflet {{is one of the}} supporting facilities which applicable to change knowledge and attitude of mother. There is no difference of mother’s motivation in participating this research. The role of husband and parents were big enough <b>in</b> two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> research <b>in</b> the treatment of nutrition undernourished child, especially in parenting and decision making in child recovery from sickness. Recommendation : This research need to be continued to study about extension impact to on mother’s behavior while taking care child.

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> two or more; groups of sows, {{or groups of}} one or more sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
