30|$|The {{finite element}} {{analysis}} results show that root reinforcement can provide a significant improvement on the stability of a slope. As expected, the factor of safety (FOS) of a slope increases as the root reinforcement properties (i.e. apparent root cohesion and depth of root zone) increase. However, the improvement on FOS is not only governed the apparent root cohesion and depth of root zone but also dependent on the underlying soil properties of the slope and slope geometry. Slopes with low <b>effective</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> tend to gain more improvement on FOS than slopes with high <b>effective</b> soil <b>cohesion.</b> Similarly, steeper slopes tend to gain more improvement on FOS than slopes with shallower slopes. This is because the failure mechanism for a slope with low <b>effective</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> {{is likely to be}} shallow seated failure and failure surface is usually located closer to the sloping ground surface where most of vegetation roots are confined into. Hence, the presence of vegetation roots has effectively reinforced the weaker zone of the slope by proving additional apparent cohesion to the soils and ‘pushed’ the failure surface deeper into the slope which ultimately increase the FOS. Similarly, steeper slopes which are more prone to shallow seated failure gain more improvement on FOS due to root reinforcement that confined to the sloping ground surface.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to provide Iowa county engineers and highway maintenance personnel with procedures {{that will allow them}} to efficiently and effectively interpret and repair or avoid landslides. The research provides an overview of basic slope stability analyses that can be used to diagnose the cause and effect associated with a slope failure. Field evidence for identifying active or potential slope stability problems is outlined. A survey of county engineers provided data for presenting a slope stability risk map for the state of Iowa. Areas of high risk are along the western border and southeastern portion of the state. These regions contain deep to moderately deep loess. The central portion of the state is a low risk area where the surficial soils are glacial till or thin loess over till. In this region, the landslides appear to occur predominately in backslopes along deeply incised major rivers, such as the Des Moines River, or in foreslopes. The south-central portion of the state is an area of medium risk where failures are associated with steep backslopes and improperly compacted foreslopes. Soil shear strength data compiled from the Iowa DOT and consulting engineers files are correlated with geologic parent materials and mean values of shear strength parameters and unit weights were computed for glacial till, friable loess, plastic loess and local alluvium. Statistical tests demonstrate that friction angles and unit weights differ significantly but in some cases <b>effective</b> stress <b>cohesion</b> intercept and undrained shear strength data do not. Moreover, <b>effective</b> stress <b>cohesion</b> intercept and undrained shear strength data show a high degree of variability. The shear strength and unit weight data are used in slope stability analyses for both drained and undrained conditions to generate curves that can be used for a preliminary evaluation of the relative stability of slopes within the four materials. Reconnaissance trips to over fifty active and repaired landslides in Iowa suggest that, in general, landslides in Iowa are relatively shallow [i. e., failure surfaces less than 6 ft (2 m) deep] and are either translational or shallow rational. Two foreslope and two backslope failure case histories provide additional insights into slope stability problems and repair in Iowa. These include the observation that embankment soils compacted to less than 95 % relative density show a marked strength decrease from soils at or above that density. Foreslopes constructed of soils derived from shale exhibit loss of strength as a result of weathering. In some situations, multiple causes of instability can be discerned from back analyses with the slope stability program XSTABL.

The constructions of strong structures require large capital, integrated designing, high maintenance cost. Strong structure methods have {{negative impact on the}} environment and sometimes not function for the design period. Plantation of vetiver system along the slopes is an alternative solution. Vetiver not only serves the purpose of slope protection but also adds green environment reducing pollution. Vetiver is available in almost all the districts of Bangladesh. This paper presents the application of vetiver system with geo-jute, for slope protection and erosion control of embankments and slopes. In-situ shear tests have been conducted on vetiver rooted soil system to find the shear strength. The shear strength and <b>effective</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> of vetiver rooted soil matrix are respectively 2. 0 times and 2. 1 times higher than that of the bared soil. Similar trends have been found in direct shear tests conducted on laboratory reconstituted samples.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} public education, {{has its roots}} in the {{development}} of ‘public morality’ instituted through religious organisations. With the separation of the state from religion, the state has increasingly begun to take on responsibility for the delivery of education. As industrialisation has become more advanced, contemporary education has moved away from strict notions of public morality to focus not only on the skills and knowledge base driven by the needs of a rapidly changing economy, but on the creation of national identity and citizenship within the nation-state. Whereas social cohesion was to be achieved by assimilating peoples of diverse religions, ethnicities and social groups into a nation with a common language and values, this was altered dramatically in the late 20 th century when assimilation became an unacceptable ideology. Education was to deliver social cohesion through integration, a subtler concept than assimilation. This required social compromise and a broader examination of the notion of citizen rights and responsibilities, including the rights of the majority as well as minorities. Social cohesion was thus placed as a central responsibility within both the public and private education systems. This chapter examines how the education system affects social cohesion. After discussion of the ways in which the practices of government and private education providers impact on social cohesion, the debates about whether segregated education systems (that is, ethno-religious schools) contribute to social cohesion are examined.

""A Thesis {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. "Thesis supervisor: Dr. John Bowders. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Shear strength parameters of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) sludge were investigated by conducting a series of constant volume direct simple shear tests on FGD specimens compacted using standard Proctor energy. Compacted FGD specimens were consolidated to three different confining stresses (500 pounds per square foot (psf), 3000 psf, 6000 psf) then sheared at a deformation rate of 0. 0002 inches per minute while the specimens' volume was maintained constant. Compaction test results indicated that for specimens with the moisture content around 50 percent, the dry unit weight of the specimens compacted using standard Proctor energy lies around 70 pcf. Results from the consolidation tests indicated that the FGD specimens used in performing the direct simple shear tests completed primary consolidation {{in a very short}} time. Durations of primary consolidation were expected to be shorter than three minutes. During the constant volume shearing stage, increases in effective normal stresses were observed indicating that the compacted and consolidated FGD specimens were trying to dilate which would generate negative pore water pressure when sheared under truly undrained conditions. The effective strength (drained strength) envelope for the compacted FGD resulted in an effective stress friction angle of 34 degrees and <b>effective</b> stress <b>cohesion</b> intercept of zero. The undrained shear strength was found to have a normalized shear strength ([tau]peak/[sigma]c) of about 1. 0 for specimens consolidated to 3000 psf or greater.

This paper presents the strength behaviour of lime-treated kaolinitic natural red earth in the presence of varying sulphate contents, up to 3, after curing for periods of up to 365 days. Alteration of soil-lime reactions in the presence of sulphate leads to the formation of ettringite after curing for longer periods. The formation of these compounds affects strength development by cementation. However, after curing for short periods, the strength of lime-treated soil is improved in the presence of sulphate. It is only after curing for longer periods that the strength is decreased. Consequently the stress-strain behaviour and effective stress paths of treated soil cured for long periods show the behaviour of a normally consolidated soil rather than of cemented soils. The reduction in strength is due primarily to a reduction in the <b>effective</b> <b>cohesion</b> intercept. The effective friction angle has not been affected significantly.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{supranational}} control over Member States’ measures to support undertakings operating in their territories was inserted {{more than fifty}} years ago in the original Treaty of Rome. Since then it has gained importance and now serves as a indispensable tool in maintaining Internal Market <b>cohesion.</b> <b>Effective</b> State aid control is a task of both great importance and great difficulty. The notion of State aid is nowhere {{to be found in the}} Treaties, but in its case-law the Court has established a set of cumulative criteria based largely on the wording of Article 107 (1) TFEU, the fulfilment of which would lead to the designation of a State’s measure as aid. Among these, the selectivity criterion is arguably the most difficult to apply. This is for three main reasons which will be discussed in-depth in this paper. First – will a measure with limited territorial scope always be selective? Second – what differentiates ‘general’ from ‘selective’ measures, especially if the former may have incidental selective effect? Third – what does ‘nature and scheme of the system’ justification mean, and how is it applied? This paper provides an overview of practical application of the selectivity criterion in both European Commission decisions and the Court’s jurisprudence in the context of safeguarding competition and preventing subsidy races between Member States...|$|R
40|$|A {{question}} how <b>effective</b> European Union <b>Cohesion</b> Fund and Structural Funds are in promoting {{economic growth and}} speeding up the process of convergence has attracted an interest of international community and a broad circle of scientists. While some authors claim that only for countries with the “right“ institutions these funds bring benefit, some research on international aid shows that financial assistance is likely to reduce quality of institutions in the recipient countries. This thesis is exploring how the absorption of EU Funds support {{and the quality of}} institutions in EU Member States affect each other by first measuring how great is the impact of public institutions quality on the EU Funds absorption (namely, the EU Funds actually received compared to the amount allocated) in a cross-country perspective, and then conducting informant interviews to find out possible effects of the EU funding (absorbed via EU co-financed projects) on institutional quality in the Member States. Study combines both quantitative and qualitative research methods thus showing that each additional increase in quality of public institutions raised absorption of EU funds by 0. 59 in the scale, given 2007 - 2013 EU Funds support period; but paradoxically EU funds just as other development aid were in a risk of legal corruption and similar practice, having negative effects on institutional quality, when EU-supported projects issue contracts for suppliers via public tendering. Results from the study can be beneficial for rethinking EU Funds management strategy and implications, and also contribute to the debate on overall impact of foreign aid interventions on the quality of government...|$|R
40|$|This study gathers {{insights}} from the leaders and residents in of six Oregon coastal communities to analyze what factors affected their resilience {{in response to}} external stressors. The impetus for the study {{was the creation of}} nearshore marine reserves off the coast of Oregon which included a mandate for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) to investigate the social and economic impacts of the reserves on nearby communities. Interviews were conducted with community members in Garibaldi, Depoe Bay, Newport, Florence, Port Orford, and Gold Beach to understand how the different communities had demonstrated resilience and what factors determined their degree of resilience. Individual community case studies were developed from interviews in the communities and were then used to compare and contrast the different stressors, impacts, responses, enabling factors, and constraining factors experienced across the communities. The factors of resilience identified through this analysis were: the presence of foundational assets; community livability; the capacity for <b>effective</b> action; community <b>cohesion,</b> engagement, and support; and the salience of external stressors relative to internal stressors. This study includes implications related to these factors of resilience meant to inform policymakers on how best to support and enhance community resilience to external stressors. These implications include: keeping in mind the need for a healthy demographic within a community; identifying and working within the community aspirations; and the management of community-agency tensions through the recognition of common goals and objectives. These findings are meant to support policymakers in enhancing resilience of these and other communities...|$|R
