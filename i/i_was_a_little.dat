He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life. The {{first was}} with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two {{frequently}} read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled {{in the intellectual}} atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes {{to the point of}} being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: [...] "I have formed romantic notions of friendship... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none."

In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King inspired him during {{the beginning of his}} career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: [...] "I heard one of his records when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy and it scared me to death because I heard all of these sounds."

[...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment.

[...] But in adapting the final two novels, the only instructions Maggs got from Adams was [...] "They don't need more than four episodes each."

500|$|Illmatic {{contains}} discerning {{treatment of}} its subject matter: gang rivalries, desolation, and {{the ravages of}} urban poverty. Nas, who was twenty years old when the album was released, focuses on depicting his own experiences, creating highly detailed first-person narratives that deconstruct the troubled life of an inner city teenager. One writer describes {{the theme of the}} album as a “tory of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw {{his way out of the}} trap. It's somewhere between The Basketball Diaries and Native Son….” The narratives featured in Illmatic originate from Nas's own experiences as an adolescent growing up in Queensbridge, as the lyrics allude to the housing projects located in the Long Island City-section of Queens, New York. Nas said in an interview in 2001: “When I made Illmatic <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid in Queensbridge trapped in the ghetto. My soul was trapped in Queensbridge projects.” In a 2012 interview, he explained his inspiration for exploring this subject matter: ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid....

I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls.

[...] Bovberg described the set as [...] "annoying" [...] for missing the episode. Bill Treadway of the DVD Verdict, on {{the exclusion of the}} episode on the DVD, said [...] "It's a small flaw in an otherwise top notch package."
