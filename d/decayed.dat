5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a <b>decayed</b> tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the <b>decayed</b> tooth.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all <b>decayed</b> by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Some nuclei can undergo double beta <b>decay</b> (ββ <b>decay)</b> {{where the}} charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta <b>decay</b> is {{difficult}} to study, as the process has an extremely long half-life. In nuclei for which both β <b>decay</b> and ββ <b>decay</b> are possible, the rarer ββ <b>decay</b> process is effectively impossible to observe. However, in nuclei where β <b>decay</b> is forbidden but ββ <b>decay</b> is allowed, the process can be seen and a half-life measured. Thus, ββ <b>decay</b> is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta <b>decay,</b> double beta <b>decay</b> does not change thus, {{at least one of}} the nuclides with some given [...] has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta <b>decay.</b>|$|R

5|$|It is {{not known}} if C.tuberosa is {{strictly}} parasitic, and needs the host to be living, {{or whether it is}} saprobic. Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include agarics (particularly Lactarius and Russula), boletes, hydnums, and polypores. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, Russula crassotunicata is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both C.tuberosa and Dendrocollybia racemosa. The Russula fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that C.tuberosa may produce fruit bodies on less <b>decayed</b> mushrooms, while D.racemosa produces them on much more heavily <b>decayed</b> mushrooms.|$|E

50|$|The {{kinematics}} of a three-body <b>decay</b> can {{be completely}} described using two variables. In a traditional Dalitz plot, the axes {{of the plot}} are the squares of the invariant masses of two pairs of the <b>decay</b> products. (For example, if particle A <b>decays</b> to particles 1, 2, and 3, a Dalitz plot for this <b>decay</b> could plot m212 on the x-axis and m223 on the y-axis.) If there are no angular correlations between the <b>decay</b> products then the distribution of these variables is flat. However symmetries may impose certain restrictions on the distribution. Furthermore, three-body <b>decays</b> are often dominated by resonant processes, in which the particle <b>decays</b> into two <b>decay</b> products, {{with one of those}} <b>decay</b> products immediately <b>decaying</b> into two additional <b>decay</b> products. In this case, the Dalitz plot will show a non-uniform distribution, with a peak around the mass of the resonant <b>decay.</b> In this way, the Dalitz plot provides an excellent tool for studying the dynamics of three-body <b>decays.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have <b>decayed</b> by now.
