50|$|The pecan weevil, Curculio caryae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an obligate feeder on {{the nuts}} of North American <b>hickories</b> <b>and</b> <b>pecans</b> (Carya species), most widely {{recognized}} as an economically important pest of the pecan, Carya illinoinensis (Fagales: Juglandaceae). It has also been observed to infest one Juglans species, the Persian walnut, Juglans regia.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the pecan truffle extends from the {{northern}} Mexico states of Nuevo Leon and Tamalpais into Québec, Canada and from the eastern seaboard out to the southern reaches of the Rocky Mountains. It is most commonly reported in association with Carya (<b>hickories</b> <b>and</b> <b>pecans)</b> <b>and</b> Quercus (oaks, the most receptive of Tuber symbiotes). However, it has occasionally been discovered in association with Corylus (hazels) and Castanea (chestnuts), and even Basswood trees. One particularly productive habitat where T. lyonii has been found is in well-managed pecan orchards, particularly {{along the edge of}} herbicide strips. This is likely due to the raised pH of the soil, which is usually around 7 or 7.5 for pecan production.|$|R
50|$|Archeological finds {{across the}} Kiamichi River basin attest to early life in its valley. A prehistoric fish weir, or trap, {{in the river}} in Pushmataha County, {{excavated}} by the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, is a particularly revealing site. Ancient Indians diverted {{the flow of the}} river with walls of stone to create a chute into which fish would flow. Radiocarbon dating of charred <b>hickory</b> <b>and</b> <b>pecan</b> hulls found at the site indicate a date of approximately 1,200 BC. Also found were stumps of cypress trees, a tree which has not grown in that portion of the county in perhaps hundreds of years.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used smoking woods include <b>hickory,</b> <b>pecan</b> <b>and</b> oak (black {{jack and}} post). Mesquite is also {{increasingly}} being used.|$|R
5000|$|... ''''Burton'''' is a {{cultivar}} of hican (nut or tree), a {{cross between}} <b>hickory</b> <b>and</b> <b>pecan,</b> species of the genus Carya. The Burton is an edible nut of the hicans; it is considered a shagbark (smaller nuts, higher yielding). Hicans can be both edible or inedible, if the nut is larger but the tree produces far less than a shagbark they are considered shellbarks. A seedling from 'Burton' is commonly called a 'Dooley Burton' {{it is also an}} edible hican nut. Burton and Dooley Burton nuts have a unique, yet very pleasing hickory flavor indicative to hickory trees. Of the two Dooley Burton seedlings produce a more noticeable hickory-flavored nut. [...] Hickory-pecan hybrids are often unproductive.|$|R

25|$|Anemophilous spring {{blooming}} {{plants such}} as oak, birch, <b>hickory,</b> <b>pecan,</b> <b>and</b> early summer grasses may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.|$|R
50|$|The moth {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} <b>hickory,</b> <b>pecan</b> <b>and</b> walnuts, {{but will also}} eat ash, elm, oak, willow, and other plants. It occasionally causes local defoliation of nut trees, but high densities do not last long enough to cause significant damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} {{woodlands}} rolling hills, meadows, and wetlands. Large trees species include post oak, <b>hickory,</b> elm, sweetgum <b>and</b> <b>pecan.</b> Smaller trees <b>and</b> shrubs include American beautyberry, dogwood, sassafras, yaupon, hawthorn, greenbriar and Alabama supplejack. Savannah grasslands {{in the park}} {{are made up of}} little bluestem, Indiangrass, purpletop, switchgrass and the endangered Centerville brazos-mint.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the region}} {{consists}} of pine forests. Most tree species found {{in the area are}} pine, <b>hickory,</b> oak, <b>pecan,</b> <b>and</b> populus. The 231 mi long Conecuh River flows at the northern end of Troy. A 45 acre lake called Pike County Lake is located {{at the southern end of}} Troy.|$|R
50|$|A {{major benefit}} of pellet grills {{is that the}} pellets are both the fuel source for cooking and a flavor {{enhancer}} that infuses food with wood fired taste. Because of their small size and composition, food-grade pellets burn cleanly, producing a light smoky flavor that people associate with traditional BBQ and wood-fire ovens. Popular varieties include apple, cherry, <b>hickory,</b> <b>pecan,</b> <b>and</b> mesquite that each impart their own distinct taste, and can complement and highlight the flavors of specific foods.For instance, fruit woods like apple and cherry pair well with fish <b>and</b> poultry, while <b>hickory</b> <b>and</b> mesquite go well with beef.|$|R

40|$|Texas is {{the second}} largest {{producer}} of pecans in the U. S, producing 30 - 90 million pounds. Pecan is the most economically important member of Carya, which includes <b>hickories</b> <b>and</b> walnuts. ● <b>Pecans</b> provide $ 62 million for growers and generate over $ 200 million in the Texas economy. Improved varieties and native are grown on more than 170, 000 acres and are grown in 50 counties in Texas. ● Since Texas was the geographic origin of the pecan species (Carya spp.), most of its pests co-evolved in the same region with the present-day crop. Cross pollination traits are considered in planting orchards since male and female flowers mature at different times in the same tree. ● Since the 1980 s, growers have reduced insecticide use by 35 %, fungicide use by 30 %, and total applications by 9 % due to wide scale implementation of IPM practices. ● Stands of improved varieties ("orchards") are planted to 35 trees per acre and then progressively thinned over 40 - 80 years to 4 to 8 trees per acre. ● Improved pecans make up 40 % of the acreage but provide 60 % of the total nut production. Yields are higher, the grafted lines produce a more desirable nut, and returns to production inputs (including pest control) are greater. Native pecans commonly grow on alluvial soils near river...|$|R
500|$|Panellus stipticus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and causes}} a white rot. This {{is a form}} of wood decay in which the wood assumes a bleached appearance and where lignin as well as cellulose and hemicellulose is broken down by enzymes secreted by the fungus. [...] Fruit bodies are usually found in tightly overlapping clusters on the sides of hardwood trees, on logs, stumps, and fallen branches. Although most commonly found on dead wood, it can also grow opportunistically in the wounds of living trees. In North America, its preferred hosts are oak, birch, maple, <b>hickory,</b> <b>pecan,</b> <b>and</b> American hornbeam, while in Europe, it is commonly found growing on oak, birch, alder, beech, hazel, chestnut, and ash. It has also been found growing on Ericia in North Africa. Although the fungus favors hardwoods, it has been reported to grow on loblolly pine and eastern white pine. Fruiting occurs September through November in Europe, the Canary Islands, and North America, although it may also sometimes be found in the spring. The fruit bodies are long-lasting and may be found year-round. It is an [...] "early-stage" [...] succession fungus, not typically recorded from plantations over 20 years old.|$|R
25|$|Logs {{and dying}} trees of several {{hardwood}} species including pignut hickory are {{attacked by the}} ambrosia beetle (Platypus quadridentatus) throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina. The false powderpost beetle (Xylobiops basilaris) attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern <b>and</b> Southern States. <b>Hickory,</b> persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), <b>and</b> <b>pecan</b> (C. illinoinensis) are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. <b>Hickory</b> <b>and</b> persimmon wood (useful {{in the manufacture of}} small products such as shuttle blocks, mallets, and mauls is sometimes seriously damaged.|$|R

50|$|This {{section of}} the country has some of the oldest known foodways in the land, with some recipes almost 400 years old. Native American {{influences}} are still quite visible in the use of cornmeal as an essential staple and found in the Southern predilection for hunting wild game, in particular wild turkey, deer, woodcock, and various kinds of waterfowl; for example, coastal North Carolina is a place where hunters will seek tundra swan as a part of Christmas dinner; the original English and Scottish settlers would have rejoiced at this revelation owing to the fact that such was banned amongst the commoner class in what is now the United Kingdom, and naturally, their descendants have not forgotten. Native Americans also consumed turtles and catfish, specifically the snapping turtle and blue catfish, both important parts of the diet in the South today. Catfish are often caught with one's bare hands, gutted, breaded, and fried to make a Southern variation on English fish and chips and turtles are turned into stews and soups. Native American tribes of the region such as the Cherokee or Choctaw often cultivated or gathered local plants like pawpaw, maypop,spicebush,sassafras, and several sorts of squash and maize, and the aforementioned fruits still are cultivated as food in a Southerner's back garden. Maize is to this day found in dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the form of grits, hoecakes, baked cornbread, and spoonbread, and nuts like the <b>hickory,</b> black walnut <b>and</b> <b>pecan</b> are commonly included in desserts and pastries as varied as mince pies, pecan pie, <b>pecan</b> rolls <b>and</b> honey buns (both are types of sticky bun), and quick breads, which were themselves invented in the South during the American Civil War.|$|R
