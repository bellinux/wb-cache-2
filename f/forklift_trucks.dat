25|$|An {{extensive}} {{fire was}} considered unlikely {{because of a}} lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than packing materials in the rear. There were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks.</b> The only barriers were curtains of plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air. This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. The building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which limited the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.|$|E

25|$|Most {{electric}} car makers stopped production {{at some point}} in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. <b>Forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923. In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, milk floats were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British milk floats. Electric golf carts were produced by Lektro as early as 1954. By the 1920s, the early heyday of {{electric car}}s had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared. Michael Brian examines the social and technological reasons for the failure of electric cars in his book Taking Charge: The Electric Automobile in America.|$|E
25|$|Battery {{swapping}} {{is common}} in warehouses using electric <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks.</b> The concept of an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896, in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric, and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric {{through the use of}} an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.|$|E
2500|$|Containerization is {{a system}} of {{intermodal}} freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and ISO containers). The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes [...] and special <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks.</b> [...] All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the accidental <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> impact forces on steel storage racks. Based on first principles of mechanics, simple models of a loaded <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> and a drive-in racking structure are presented. Model masses, as well as stiffness and damping coefficients are calibrated against experimental results obtained from tests of a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> and a drive-in racking structure. Comparisons between experimental results and solutions obtained from the simple mechanical models show that the simple models accurately reproduce the static and dynamic behaviours of their associated structures. Based on the drive-in rack impact test results presented in a companion paper (Gilbert and Rasmussen, submitted for publication) [1] and the simple mechanical models for drive-in racks, actual impact forces are calculated and presented. Finally, using the impact test results and the simple mechanical models, the actual motion of the <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> body is calculated. This motion, being a common characteristic to all drive-in racking impacts, allows impact forces to be obtained for various pallet loads, impact elevations and rack characteristics. Thus, the paper concludes with a general method for calculating forces generated under <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> impact. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
2500|$|Handling {{goods on}} pallets was a {{significant}} improvement over using hand trucks or carrying sacks or boxes by hand and greatly speeded up loading and unloading of trucks, rail cars and ships. [...] Pallets can be handled with pallet jacks or <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> which began being used in industry in the 1930s and became widespread by the 1950s. [...] Loading docks built to architectural standards allow trucks or rail cars to load and unload at the same elevation as the warehouse floor.|$|E
