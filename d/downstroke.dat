Whitfield in 1974, but the details of istiodactylid flight performance have not been studied. Witton suggested that istiodactylids would have been powerful fliers, due to an enlarged area for <b>downstroke</b> musculature attachments and well-developed pectoral and upper arm bones, and they probably spent {{much time in the}} air. Istiodactylids had wing-membranes connected to shortened bodies with short legs and long forelimbs, which may have created large wings with a high aspect ratio and low wing loadings. The wings of the istiodactylid Nurhachius have been compared to those of modern soaring birds (that fly with little flapping), and may have been ideal for low-energy soaring, which is necessary when searching for carrion. Flight is very important to birds that scavenge, as it helps them locate, reach, and eat carcasses before they are found by terrestrial carnivores. The wings of istiodactylids seem to have been shorter than those of other ornithocheiroids, which may have been more adapted to oceanic soaring; their wings may have been more suited for taking off and landing. Modern birds that soar inland have shorter and deeper wings than those that soar over the ocean; the wing shape of istiodactylids indicate that they may have preferred terrestrial settings.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} two wing strokes (the {{upstroke}} and <b>downstroke)</b> in each cycle of the wing movement, the kinetic energy is 2×43=86erg. This is about {{as much energy as}} is consumed in hovering itself.|$|E

25|$|Insects gain kinetic energy, {{provided}} by the muscles, when they accelerate. When the wings begin to decelerate {{toward the end of}} the stroke, this energy must dissipate. During the <b>downstroke,</b> the kinetic energy is dissipated by the muscles themselves and is converted into heat (this heat is sometimes used to maintain core body temperature). Some insects are able to utilize the kinetic energy in the upward movement of the wings to aid in their flight. The wing joints of these insects contain a pad of elastic, rubber-like protein called resilin. During the upstroke of the wing, the resilin is stretched. The kinetic energy of the wing is converted into potential energy in the stretched resilin, which stores the energy much like a spring. When the wing moves down, this energy is released and aids in the <b>downstroke.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flight {{feathers}} are stiffened {{so as to}} {{work against}} {{the air in the}} <b>downstroke</b> but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of β-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers.|$|E

25|$|In Robinson's model, {{both the}} <b>downstroke</b> and the {{upstroke}} {{would have been}} powerful. In 1982, she was criticised by Samuel Tarsitano, Eberhard Frey and Jürgen Riess, who claimed that, while the muscles at {{the underside of the}} shoulder and pelvic plates were clearly powerful enough to pull the limbs downwards, comparable muscle groups on the top of these plates to elevate the limbs were simply lacking, and, had they been present, could not have been forcefully employed, their bulging carrying the danger of hurting the internal organs. They proposed a more limited flying model in which a powerful <b>downstroke</b> was combined with a largely unpowered recovery, the flipper returning to its original position by the momentum of the forward moving and temporarily sinking body. This modified flying model became a popular interpretation. Less attention was given to an alternative hypothesis by Stephen Godfrey in 1984, which proposed that both the forelimbs and hindlimbs performed a deep paddling motion to the rear combined with a powered recovery stroke to the front, resembling the movement made by the forelimbs of sea-lions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} insect flight {{is the body}} tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as forward velocity increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the <b>downstroke,</b> the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal efficiency through as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces {{may be more than}} three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful upstroke of the flapping motion.|$|E
500|$|Also, wishbone; merry-thought. From the Latin for [...] "little fork"', the furcula is a forked bone, {{also found}} in some dinosaurs, located below the neck and formed by the fusion of the two clavicles. Its primary {{function}} is in the strengthening of the thoracic skeleton to withstand the rigors of flight. It works as a strut between a bird's shoulders, and articulates to each of a bird's scapulae. In conjunction with the coracoid and the scapula, it forms a unique structure called the triosseal canal, which houses a strong tendon that connects the supracoracoideus muscles to the humerus. This system is responsible for lifting the wings during a recovery stroke. As the thorax is compressed by the flight muscles during a <b>downstroke,</b> the upper ends of the furcula spread apart, expanding {{by as much as}} 50% of its resting width, and then contract. Furcula may also aid in respiration, by helping to pump air through the air sacs.|$|E

According to Lehtinen, he used only two bass string sets and broke five picks.Pekka and Antti took turns recording their rhythm and lead guitar parts, respectively. Both guitarists played by striking the guitar strings at a 45-degree angle to achieve a more aggressive sound. Several of the guitar techniques used on the album had specific names: [...] "Jynkhä" [...] described the rapid succession of <b>downstrokes,</b> and a slower version of this technique was called [...] "perusjynkhä." [...] Speed-picking with alternating upstrokes and <b>downstrokes</b> {{was referred to as}} [...] "hionta", Finnish for grinding. Some of the techniques used were difficult for Pekka, and his brother Antti took the time to show him proper fingering and grasps.|$|R
500|$|Primaries are {{connected}} to the manus (the bird's [...] "hand", composed of carpometacarpus and phalanges); these are the longest and narrowest of the remiges (particularly those attached to the phalanges), and they can be individually rotated. [...] These feathers are especially important for flapping flight, as they are the principal source of thrust, moving the bird forward through the air. [...] The mechanical properties of primaries are important in supporting flight. Most thrust is generated on the <b>downstroke</b> of flapping flight. [...] However, on the upstroke (when the bird often draws its wing in close to its body), the primaries are separated and rotated, reducing air resistance while still helping to provide some thrust. The flexibility of the remiges on the wingtips of large soaring birds also allows for the spreading of those feathers, which helps to reduce the creation of wingtip vortices, thereby reducing drag. The barbules on these feathers, friction barbules, are specialized with large lobular barbicels that help grip and prevent slippage of overlying feathers and are present in most of the flying birds.|$|E

Friction barbules support lobe-shaped ("lobular") [...] that are broader than the typical barbicel hosted by other vaned feathers, and which in turn support more [...] The theory is that the augmented surface area and other adaptations significantly increases grip through friction when the outer web of barbs of one primary feather come into contact and rub against the inner web of barbs of another primary feather it overlays, thereby preventing slippage during the rigors of flight. Friction barbules are found only on those parts of primary feathers that are in [...] "zones of overlap" [...] with neighboring primaries. The theory (and the use of [...] "friction" [...] in the title of the defined phrase) has been criticized. In Avian Flight (2005), the author notes that [...] "most birds open and close their wings during every wing beat cycle", and proposes that the energetic cost to overcome friction during the [...] "wing extension and flexion" [...] of each beat cycle would be prohibitive. Offered instead is the theory that the function of these specialized barbules is to lock the primary feathers together on the wings' <b>downstroke,</b> during which high pressure from below the wings' surface would otherwise tend to cause the feathers to spread.|$|E

While most modern passerines have ten primaries, some have only nine. Those with nine are missing the most distal primary, sometimes called the , which is typically very small and sometimes rudimentary in passerines.|$|E

500|$|Advances in {{military}} technology aided the Song dynasty in its defense against hostile {{neighbors to the}} north. The flamethrower found its origins in Byzantine-era Greece, employing Greek fire (a chemically complex, highly flammable petrol fluid) in a device with a siphon hose by the 7th century. The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917, written by Wu Renchen in his Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms. In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' {{that could not be}} doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu in his Wuyue Beishi, hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire (see also Pen Huo Qi). Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from one of China's maritime contacts in the 'southern seas', Arabia (Dashiguo). In the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from Wuyue defeated a Huainan army from the Wu state; Wenmu's success was facilitated by the use of 'fire oil' ('huo you') to burn their fleet, signifying the first Chinese use of gunpowder in a battle. The Chinese applied the use of double-piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and <b>downstroke),</b> lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame. This device was featured in description and illustration of [...] the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044. In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction.|$|E
2500|$|Most insects use {{a method}} that creates a {{spiralling}} leading edge vortex. These flapping wings move through two basic half-strokes. The <b>downstroke</b> starts up and back and is plunged downward and forward. [...] Then the wing is quickly flipped over (supination) so that the leading edge is pointed backward. The upstroke then pushes the wing upward and backward. Then the wing is flipped again (pronation) and another <b>downstroke</b> can occur. The frequency range in insects with synchronous flight muscles typically is 5 to 200 hertz (Hz). In those with asynchronous flight muscles, wing beat frequency may exceed 1000Hz. When the insect is hovering, the two strokes take {{the same amount of}} time. A slower <b>downstroke,</b> however, provides thrust.|$|E

50|$|The pick (or plectrum) is used {{to obtain}} a more {{articulate}} attack, for speed, or just personal preference. Although {{the use of a}} pick is primarily associated with rock and punk rock, picks are also used in other styles. Jazz bassist Steve Swallow often plays with a pick, while Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters uses one for a heavier tone. Mike Gordon of Phish uses a pick while also incorporating slapping techniques into his playing. Picks can be used with alternating <b>downstrokes</b> and upstrokes, or with all <b>downstrokes</b> for a more consistent attack. The pick is usually held with the index and thumb, with the up-and-down plucking motion supplied by the wrist.|$|R
50|$|The pointed nib is {{flexible}} {{and comes to}} a sharp point rather than a broad edge. Thick and thin strokes are achieved by varying the amount {{of pressure on the}} nib. Thick lines are created on <b>downstrokes</b> by pushing down on the nib, causing the nib tines to splay and allowing more ink to flow through the widened slit onto the writing surface. Lighter pressure produces less flexing of the tines, creating thinner strokes. The finest hairline strokes are created on the upstrokes and sideways strokes. Due to the shape of the pointed nib, thick lines can only be produced on <b>downstrokes.</b> If too much pressure is applied to the pen on an upstroke, the nib tines are likely to dig into the paper.|$|R

2500|$|Stiffer skin is {{necessary}} for bat wing skin oriented in the direction parallel to the long axes of the bones to prevent too much deformation of bat wing skin during flight(with respect to the bone), resulting in the shearing of the bat wing skin off of the bone. Flexible skin {{is necessary}} for the direction perpendicular to the long axes of the bones for facilitating the shape changes needed for movement and control during flight. [...] This anisotropy of bat wing skin is also useful as method of storing and releasing elastic energy, particularly during the <b>downstroke.</b> During the <b>downstroke,</b> the bat extends its wing [...] and the wing skin experiences an aerodynamic force.

40|$|Recently, a {{statistical}} signal-processing technique {{has allowed the}} information carried by single spike trains of sensory neurons on time-varying stimuli to be characterized quantitatively {{in a variety of}} preparations. In weakly electric fish, its application to first-order sensory neurons encoding electric field amplitude (P-receptor afferents) showed that they convey accurate information on temporal modulations in a behaviorally relevant frequency range (< 80 Hz). At the next stage of the electrosensory pathway (the electrosensory lateral line lobe, ELL), the information sampled by first-order neurons is used to extract upstrokes and <b>downstrokes</b> in the amplitude modulation waveform. By using signal-detection techniques, we determined that these temporal features are explicitly represented by short spike bursts of second-order Summary neurons (ELL pyramidal cells). Our results suggest that the biophysical mechanism underlying this computation is of dendritic origin. We also investigated the accuracy with which upstrokes and <b>downstrokes</b> are encoded across two of the three somatotopic body maps of the ELL (centromedial and lateral). Pyramidal cells of the centromedial map, in particular I-cells, encode up- and <b>downstrokes</b> more reliably than those of the lateral map. This result correlates well with the significance of these temporal features for a particular behavior (the jamming avoidance response) as assessed by lesion experiments of the centromedial map.
