50|$|A trial {{took place}} in Sopwell and Verulam wards under which voters could vote either by {{internet}}, phone, post or at the polling station using a touch screen system. The internet voting trial {{was funded by the}} Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions as part of an attempt to get more people involved in elections. As a result of the trial one of the wards set the fastest <b>declaration</b> <b>time</b> at only 4 minutes after the close of polling. However turnout was actually down from 24.1% to 23.3% in Sopwell ward and down from 41.9% to 38.9% in Verulam ward compared to the last election in 2000.|$|E
40|$|Aim. The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to determine}} mean admission time after calls, resuscitation success rate, and determine the rate of medical emergency team (MET) calls of clinics in hospital by assessing the incoming calls to MET at intensive care unit. Methods. This study was conducted by collecting emergency call forms of 147 patients. The data including age, gender, medical diagnosis, the name of the caller department, cause of call, occurrence time, call time, attending time, medical care termination time and the outcomes were extracted from the forms or patient files. Event <b>declaration</b> <b>time</b> was accepted as minute time difference between occurrence time and call time. Duration of admission was accepted as minute time difference between call times and attending time. Duration of resuscitation was accepted as minute time difference between attending time and medical care termination time. Results. Mean event <b>declaration</b> <b>time</b> was 3. 3 ± 3. 0 minutes. Mean duration of admission was 3. 7 ± 1. 6 minutes. Mean duration of resuscitation was 20. 5 ± 12. 7 minutes. The resuscitation of 84 patients (63. 6 %) was successful while 48 patients (36. 4 %) died at the end of resuscitation. It was found that the patients with a result of successful resuscitation were significantly younger and their duration of resuscitation was significantly shorter. Conclusion. We indicate that MET system {{is an essential part of}} in-hospital emergency medical care system. We suggest that a blue code call system should be established by intensive care unit members and announced to all hospital staff...|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : Confidentiality and PrivacyInternational audienceInference {{control of}} queries for {{relational}} databases confines the information content {{and thus the}} usability of data returned to a client, aiming to keep some pieces of information confidential as specified in a policy, in particular {{for the sake of}} privacy. In general, there is a tradeoff between the following factors: on the one hand, the expressiveness offered to administrators to declare a schema, a confidentiality policy and assumptions about a client’s a priori knowledge; on the other hand, the computational complexity of a provably confidentiality preserving enforcement mechanism. We propose and investigate a new balanced solution for a widely applicable situation: we admit relational schemas with functional and join dependencies, which are also treated as a priori knowledge, and select-project sentences for policies and queries; we design an efficient signature-based enforcement mechanism that we implement for an Oracle/SQL-system. At <b>declaration</b> <b>time,</b> the inference signatures are compiled from an analysis of all possible crucial inferences, and at run time they are employed like in the field of intrusion detection...|$|E

40|$|Sickness {{certification}} is {{a routine}} task {{of primary care}} (PC) physicians which {{has an impact on}} patients' health, the health care system and the economy. As sickness certification is poorly studied, we quantified sickness certification and explored qualitatively the sickness certification process by Swiss PC physicians. PC physicians participating in the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network (SSSN) recorded the frequency and duration of absence from work of each related consultation and certificate during 2005. Patients' age and gender, reason for sick leave, psychosocial cofactors, problems at the workplace, type of employment, type of occupation, duration of absence (weeks) and type of certificate were registered. Physicians' views on the procedure and their suggestions for change were gathered before and after the study by means of a questionnaire containing four open-ended questions. Of the 223 SSSN physicians 73 % participated. A total of 24, 676 forms issued by 150 physicians were analysed. An average of four certificates was issued per 100 consultations; somewhat fewer by internists than by general practitioners and less in rural areas than urban areas. Psychosocial or work-related factors were mentioned in 20 % of the certificates and were more often associated with longer absences from work. These factors were seen as inseparable from the somatic factors. Recommendations for change included the prolongation of self <b>declaration</b> <b>time,</b> a uniform declaration form, availability of an authority to which complex cases can be referred and the use of case management models. Sickness certificates were issued in 4 % of GP consultations. This task has been assessed by physicians as part of their function. The certification process should be improved through better coordination and communication between all parties involved: patients, employers, insurers, physicians and politicians...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) {{is the lack of}} an onboard pilot that can comply with the legal requirement identified in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that pilots see and avoid other aircraft. UAS will be expected to demonstrate the means to perform the function of see and avoid while preserving the safety level of the airspace and the efficiency of the air traffic system. This paper introduces a Sense and Avoid (SAA) concept for integration of UAS into the NAS that is currently being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and identifies areas that require additional experimental evaluation to further inform various elements of the concept. The concept design rests on interoperability principles that take into account both the Air Traffic Control (ATC) environment as well as existing systems such as the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Specifically, the concept addresses the determination of well clear values that are large enough to avoid issuance of TCAS corrective Resolution Advisories, undue concern by pilots of proximate aircraft and issuance of controller traffic alerts. The concept also addresses appropriate <b>declaration</b> <b>times</b> for projected losses of well clear conditions and maneuvers to regain well clear separation...|$|R

Individuals declare their opinions asynchronously, can observe the stated opinions of their neighbors, and are free to update their <b>declarations</b> over <b>time.</b> Supposing that individuals conform with the majority report of their neighbors, we ask whether the population will eventually arrive at consensus on the ground truth.

On the other hand, we prove that for networks that are sparse and expansive, the population will converge to the correct opinion with high probability...|$|R

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Aphthous stomamtitis is {{characterized}} by single or multiple painful recurrent lesions in oral mucosa. Lesions can relapse in some patients for several years. Therefore treatment of such cases seems necessary. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the therapeutic effect of topical Myrtus communis (myrtle) solution with topical triamcinolone (Adcortyle) in the treatment of minor apotheosis. Materials & Methods: This clinical-trial study was conducted at Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences in 2009. 100 patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. The 1 st group received topical myrtle solution. The 2 nd group received topical trimcinolone (Adcortyle). After one week, patients' <b>declaration</b> about <b>time</b> of the recovery of the pain and deterioration of oral lesion was recorded. The gathered data was then analyzed using the SPSS statistical software using t-test and chi-square. Results: After treatment, both groups showed response to topical medications with no significant difference between them (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: results of this study showed that topical myrtle solution is effective in the treatment of minor aphthous stomatitis and its therapeutic effect is comparable with topical triamcinolone (Adcortyle) ...|$|R
