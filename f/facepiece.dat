25|$|In all cases, if {{employer}} select respirator with tight-fitting <b>facepiece</b> (full face mask, elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or filtering <b>facepiece</b> respirator), all employee must be fit tested (to prevent leakage unfiltered {{polluted air}} through gaps between {{their faces and}} the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces). Appendix A provides {{a detailed description of}} this testing.|$|E
25|$|If {{respirator}} <b>facepiece</b> is loosely fitting one (hoods, helmets etc.) {{polluted air}} can also enter the breathing zone {{due to its}} injection (with moving stream of ambient air, unless it is motionless).

Second {{objective of this}} work was to measure the size-resolved penetration of 9 complete FFRs (selected from identical filtering <b>facepieces</b> as in the first case) placed on the manikin (refered as manikin-based). The results obtained by these two methods were compared and the real MPPS of all FFRs obtained by both methods were estimated...|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} difference between the real and laboratory efficiency prompted the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) released in 1982 two informational messages on respirators, warning consumers about the low effectiveness of RPD of the type that is expected to provide reliable protection. The experts were alarmed: they do not understand why (after the supplying more than 115 liters of clean air per minute under the <b>facepiece)</b> {{there are a lot of}} pollution in the inhaled air.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the first personal sampling pump (1958) {{made it possible to}} simultaneously measure the concentrations of air pollutions outside the respirator mask, {{and at the same time}} - pollution of inhaled air (under a <b>facepiece).</b> Comparison of these measurement results show the effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment. But until the 1970s experts mistakenly believed that the protective properties of the respirator under laboratory and in the production conditions are not significantly different. Measuring the effectiveness of respirators under production conditions were not performed; and limits of areas of safe use for different types of respirators were established on the basis of laboratory tests only.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of {{protection}} factors of negative pressure full face masks with high-efficiency filters {{in the laboratory}} revealed a risk of decrease in protective properties to a small values. Therefore, {{the use of such}} respirators has been limited to the values 50 or 100 PEL in the United States. However, the experts in the UK believed that the quality of their masks is higher than American masks, and were allowed to use up to 900 OEL. But the study showed that the value of the protection factor of > 900 has been achieved in practice infrequently. Minimum protection factors of 3 different models of full <b>facepiece</b> respirators were 11, 18 and 26. So, the new standards limit usage of these respirators up to 40 OEL in UK (after this study).|$|E

Scientists simultaneously measured dust concentrations with the personal samplers and two dust collectors - without mask and in the <b>facepiece.</b> Also, they measured the proportion of time, then the respirators were used by miners. For this purpose, two thermistor (one in the <b>facepiece,</b> {{the other on the}} belt) were used; over-heating PTC with expired air was a sign of wearing a mask. Because convenience of the respirators affect on the timeliness of its usage, scientists have studied the opinion of the miners on the use of respirators. A detailed report was published before the publication of the article.|$|E
2500|$|All {{respirators}} {{have some}} type of <b>facepiece</b> held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method. The <b>facepiece</b> of the respirator covers either the entire face or {{the bottom half of the}} face including the nose and mouth. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with chlorine gas would have to wear a full-face respirator. Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The [...] differences in respirator design impact the respirator assigned protection factors, ie the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.|$|E

2500|$|If the <b>facepiece</b> of the {{respirator}} is tight-fitting one (elastomeric quarter or half masks, filtering facepieces, or full-face masks), efficiency decreases due to leakage of unfiltered {{air through}} {{the gaps between}} the mask and face.

2500|$|... (1999) The {{researchers}} used {{an original}} method for measuring full <b>facepiece</b> performance. Determining {{the concentration of}} harmful substances under the mask can be very difficult, since the concentration can be very small. To solve this problem, the researchers attached to the mask hood under which supplied test gas (sulfur hexafluoride). Since workers do not travel long distances, the gas concentration was measured by stationary devices with long tubes. This method allows to accurately measure the gas leakage through the gaps between the mask and the face. They also used the standard EU methodology for determining leakage, which is used for respirator certification.|$|E
