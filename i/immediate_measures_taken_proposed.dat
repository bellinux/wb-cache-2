40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{report the}} first records of Amur goby, Rhinogobius lindbergi and the Chinese false gudgeon, Abbottina rivularis from the Lake Buyr {{drainage}} of eastern Mongolia. Both species were previ-ously known only from much farther downstream in the Amur River basin. Because of their abundance at three sites separated by 11 km in Lake Buyr and a tribuary stream, and presence of multiple size classes, we strongly suspect that these species are established. Both {{species have been}} widely dispersed outside of the Amur River basin as contaminants in cultured, large-bodied cyprinids (Ctenopharyngodon, Hypoph-thalmichthys, Parabramis), and we suggest {{that this is the}} most likely means of their introduction into Lake Buyr.

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{decomposed}} {{the changes in}} industrial water use into three hierarchies (output, technology, and structure) using a refined Laspeyres decomposition model, and found monotonous and exclusive trends in the output and technology hierarchies. Based on that research, this study proposes a hierarchical prediction approach to forecast future industrial water demand. Three water demand scenarios (high, medium, and low) were then established based on potential future industrial structural adjustments, and used to predict water demand for the structural hierarchy. The predictive results of this approach were compared with results from a grey prediction model (GPM (1, 1)). The comparison shows {{that the results of}} the two approaches were basically identical, differing by less than 10 %. Taking Tianjin, China, as a case, and using data from 2003 - 2012, this study predicts that industrial water demand will continuously increase, reaching 580 million m(3), 776. 4 million m(3), and approximately 1. 09 billion m(3) by the years 2015, 2020 and 2025 respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an attempt}} to give a comprehensive account of the system of education in Morocco as well as its historical development and the influence of various trends. It is also an investigation into the different stages that Moroccan education has gone through and their influence on the present situation. This work consists of seven chapters: Chapter One introduces the different aspects of the country: the geographical, cultural, economic and historical features of Morocco. Chapter Two is concerned with education in Morocco before 1912, i. e. before the Protectorate, with emphasis on its traditional institutions and teachings which still persist. The second part of this chapter deals with education under the Protectorate, especially the influence of the French system and the decisions that were then created among Moroccans. Chapter Three is an examination of education from Independence until the present time, the different problems that faced the Ministry of National Education and what <b>immediate</b> <b>measures</b> were <b>taken</b> to tackle them. Chapter Four provides a survey {{of the structure of the}} system of education in Morocco, especially the pre-primary, the primary and secondary levels. In addition to describing these different levels, there is a discussion of the reforms that have been implemented since Independence.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} how legislators on international, European and national level combat the financing of terrorism. The central question {{in this article is}} whether European regulations concerning the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, are effective, proportional and mutually harmonious.

The physicochemical parameters and trace/heavy metals were determined in all water samples. The results manifested significant seasonal variations among Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb and the metals exhibited highest contribution in premonsoon season except Mn. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) revealed considerable anthropogenic intrusions in the reservoir. Probable risk associated with the metals levels on human health was also evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal routes for adults and children. It was noted that Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb (HQing> 1) {{were the most important}} pollutants leading to noncarcinogenic concerns. The HQderm levels of all metals were below unity, suggesting that these metals posed no hazards via dermal absorption, while the oral intake was the major exposure pathway.

40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of threats, {{identifying}} favorable growing conditions, and predicting future population scenarios are vital for the conservation and management of threatened species. This study investigated the availability, microhabitat characteristics, threat status, and community associations of Swertia chirayta, a highly threatened Himalayan medicinal herb, in 22 populations in Sikkim, India, using the vertical belt transect method. Of the 14 microhabitats identified, open grassy slope emerged as the most favorable and wet grassy slope as the least favorable for S. chirayta.

Drawing on insights from the literature on coordination games and network growth, we develop a simple model to clarify how trust breaks down in financial systems.
