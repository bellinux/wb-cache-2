5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout.

Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s.

John Cowper Powys's novel A Glastonbury Romance is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail.|$|E

5|$|The main approach, {{from the}} north, is defended by earthworks, {{comprising}} three ditches, with a rampart, or earthen wall, between. Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage, traditionally said to lead into the castle, {{but in fact}} accessing an 18th-century ice house. There are no openings within {{the lower part of}} the castle's walls, excepting the entrance and the postern, or side <b>gate,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys. Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard, but were never built. The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble, with dressings in lighter Ballengeich stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{main entry}} <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tomb is two-storied and its façade has very {{elaborate}} ornamentation over plastered surfaces {{and is in}} ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic {{on the surface and}} its translation reads “When the hero of plain bravery departs from the transitory, may he become a resident of god’s paradise”. The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes.|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon <b>gate,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as {{allowing him to}} jump long distances or walk over lava. To {{use the power of}} a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E
