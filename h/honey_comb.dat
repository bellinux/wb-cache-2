The successful production of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> requires that the hive remain crowded without inducing swarming.

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> Today, most honey is produced for extraction but <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing <b>comb</b> <b>honey,</b> which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|R

50|$|The {{brood comb}} is usually {{found in the}} lower part of the beehive, while the <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> may {{surround}} the brood area and is found exclusively in the honey supers. When a queen does not have enough brood comb to lay eggs, usually due to congestion from pollen or honey, the bee colony may be more prone to swarm.|$|E
50|$|Natural queen {{exclusion}} occurs {{more frequently}} in top-bar hives, because the brood nest is separated from the honey section by at least a full bar of <b>honey</b> <b>comb,</b> {{and not just a}} few centimetres of honey as may be the case in a multi-storey framed hive. And the more honey is gathered, the further the brood nest becomes from newly created comb.|$|E

40|$|We exposed {{honey bee}} workers and brood to four entomopathogenic {{nematode}} species under conditions normally {{encountered in the}} hive by spraying nematodes onto combs. Mortality of adult bees exposed {{to any of the}} nematode species was less than 10 %, and {{there was no evidence of}} nematode infection when dead adults were dissected. To assess the impact of nematodes on brood, we used smaller-size <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> placed in the second story (super) of a hive and large brood combs placed in the main section of the hive. Our results were inconsistent between these two experimental designs. The smaller <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> sprayed with Steinernema carpocapsae contained the largest number of uncapped ceils, those sprayed with Heterorhabditis baeteriophora or S. riobravis contained an intermediate number of uncapped cells, and control combs and those sprayed with S. glaseri contained the fewest nmnber of uncapped cells. Large combs sprayed with S. riobravis contained more uncapped ceils than controls or those sprayed with S. carpocapsae, although the differences were not significant. Our results do not support the hypothesis that high-temperature-tolerant species of nematodes are necessarily more infective to honey bees...|$|R

50|$|A honey {{extractor}} is a mechanical device {{used in the}} extraction of honey from honeycombs. A {{honey extractor}} extracts the honey from the <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> without destroying the comb. Extractors work by centrifugal force. A drum or container holds a frame basket which spins, flinging the honey out. With this method the wax comb stays intact within the frame and can be reused by the bees.|$|E
50|$|Some {{hobbyist}} beekeepers and beekeepers {{in developing}} countries, especially keepers of top-bar hives, cut the whole <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> {{out of the}} frame, and use it directly as cut comb honey. To extract liquid honey, the comb can be crushed to release the honey and strained to remove the wax and other impurities. Alternatively, cut comb is put into a honey press to squeeze out the honey.|$|E
50|$|Although both wooden {{and steel}} moulds {{can be used}} to {{construct}} the Xbloc formwork, steel moulds are preferred as they can be used repetitively to produce large numbers of armour units.

An appropriate formwork design is facilitating the stripping of the moulds at an early stage and prevents to large extent from <b>honey</b> <b>combing,</b> surface bubbles and striking damages.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Porous {{metals and}} {{metallic}} foams are composite materials {{in which one}} phase is gaseous and another phase is solid metal. The mechanical behavior of these materials depends mainly on the mechanical properties of the solid metallic phase, the structural configuration of the solid and {{the density of the}} composite ρc, relative to the density of the solid phase ρs. The primary distinction between a porous metal and metallic foam is the relative density, metal gas composites with a relative density (ρc/ρs) above 0. 3 are generally considered porous materials, while those with a relative density below 0. 3 are generally considered to be metallic foams or <b>honey</b> <b>combs.</b> Another distinction between the two is in the interaction between adjacent voids in the structure. Porous metals and metallic foams can have open cells, with completely interconnected voids, or closed cells, with each void being isolated by a solid film. This review outlines the process parameters and foaming agents used in manufacturing methods of Aluminium metallic foams and discusses benefits and concerns associated with their uses. Many research works have been done on this particular topic and various technologies have been proposed and applied at experimental and field levels. Key words: porous metals, foaming agent, <b>honey</b> <b>combs...</b>|$|R
