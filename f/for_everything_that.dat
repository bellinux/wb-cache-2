25|$|Guazzini's latest moves include renting the Parc des Princes, Stade de France, {{and most}} {{recently}} King Baudouin Stadium for big games, and using pink jerseys. Stade Fran√ßais are heavily criticised by old-timers, especially in France's rugby bastions in the south, for their innovative spirit which tends to hurt traditional image and values of rugby such as humility and seriousness. Some people are wary of the club's relation {{to the world of}} media and show business (players are regularly invited as TV show guests). The critiques can also be explained by the historic Paris vs provinces divide and some form of acrimony {{in the rest of the}} country <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> comes from the capital. Others consider it is good for rugby in its quest to maintain itself as France's second most popular sport after Association football and shed its image as a gross rural south-western form of fistfight.|$|E

Gekko confronts Bretton {{about what he did}} to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox, and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.|$|E
500|$|The Italian author Italo Calvino, in his 1991 book Why Read the Classics?, {{wrote that}} while people often consult Pliny's Natural History for facts and curiosities, {{he is an}} author who [...] "deserves an {{extended}} read, for the measured movement of his prose, which is enlivened by his admiration <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> exists and his respect for the infinite diversity of all phenomena". Calvino notes that while Pliny is eclectic, he was not uncritical, though his evaluations of sources are inconsistent and unpredictable. Further, Calvino compares Pliny to Immanuel Kant, in that God is prevented by logic from conflicting with reason, even though (in Calvino's view) Pliny makes a pantheistic identification of God as being immanent in nature. As for destiny, Calvino writes: ...|$|E

Back in Norway he supervised {{the publication of the}} book, then visited Britain before embarking on a long lecture tour of the United States. In February1913, while in Madison, Wisconsin, he received the news that Scott and four comrades had reached the pole on 17January 1912, but had all perished by 29March, during their return journey. The bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers had been discovered in November1912, {{after the end of the}} Antarctic winter. In his initial response, Amundsen called the news [...] "Horrible, horrible". His more formal tribute followed: [...] "Captain Scott left a record, for honesty, for sincerity, for bravery, <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> makes a man".|$|E
500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E
500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian in 2013 cited Mughal-e-Azam as a [...] "landmark of cinema" [...] {{despite its}} {{historical}} inaccuracies, and the BBC stated in 2005 {{that it is}} [...] "widely considered one of Bollywood's most iconic films". Imtiaz Ali of The Times of India in 2010 called it the [...] "most proto-typical, high involvement, expensive, passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced", one that [...] "set the standard <b>for</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> will ever come after it". It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of Gone with the Wind. Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film like this could never be repeated: [...] "Mughal-e-Azam is an all-time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels. So it will always remain alive for generations to come." [...] To commemorate the film's anniversary, Asif's friend the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled Mughal-E-Azam‚Äì A Tribute by a son to his father. Hosted by Khan, it includes interviews with Asif's family and Bollywood stars. Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video, in which he re-imagined some memorable scenes. Interested in preserving the film for future generations, Khan noted {{that his father was}} originally cast in the film but did not complete it. When asked if Mughal-e-Azam should be remade, he retorted: [...] "It is the mother of all films; mothers cannot be remade". No sequels have been made, but Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam (2008) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play; it received very poor ratings from critics. In October 2016, producer Feroz Abbas Khan premiered a stage play based on the film with a cast of over 70 actors and dancers at Mumbai's NCPA theatre.|$|E
