25|$|In 1969, {{with the}} {{replacement}} of António de Oliveira Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the Estado Novo-controlled nation <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> slight taste of democracy, such as permission to rebuild a democratic Labour Union movement. José Afonso joined the movement and supported it by all the means he could; he also {{took part in the}} second wave of student rebellion against the regime in Coimbra, an important university town. He released the album Contos Velhos Rumos Novos and the single Menina dos Olhos Tristes which contains the popular song Canta Camarada (Sing, Sing, Comrade!) which was almost adopted by the Portuguese Communist Party as an unofficial anthem. He received the award for best album that year, and again in 1970 and 1971. For the first time on a Zeca album, an instrument other than the guitar was used. His fourth and last son, Pedro, was born.|$|E

Michell explained that [...] "When you are casting a cabal of friends, {{you have to}} cast a balance of qualities, of types and of sensibilities. They were the jigsaw {{that had to be}} put together all in one go, and I think we've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good variety of people who can realistically still live in the same world." ...|$|E

I'm a big collector of pop art and graffiti art at this point, too — D*Face and Banksy, also Roy Lichtenstein ... and it's been very fun venturing off into that zone.|$|E
500|$|Selänne's primary {{attribute}} is his skating speed. Nicknamed the [...] "Finnish Flash", {{he uses his}} speed to evade opposition defenders. [...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it just makes for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{interview}} with Bev Vincent, Isanove opined that Walter was his favorite character to draw; [...] "Jae [...] established him as almost androgynous. He's always got this bare chest, and he's very feminine {{in the way he}} moves, with his hands raised. He's always moving his hands around. He's got this weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> white separation in the middle of it. He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character." ...|$|E

Impressed with Russell Mulcahy's work on Highlander, , The Shadow and Ricochet, Anderson signed Mulcahy on as director, stating, [...] "Russell pioneered a very distinct visual style, {{a lot of}} moving camera and crane work, lots of very fast cutting. He’s <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> cool eye and sees great ways to shoot. His work certainly had a big influence on me as a filmmaker and that’s why I was very excited {{to work with him}} on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, {{and it seemed to}} have the right spirit. It's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|Chinatown buses {{have been}} {{involved}} in numerous accidents over the years, and there have been 34 intercity bus accidents across the United States in 2001–2011.

Often, [...] "calculations of safety and risk are inverted," [...] according to a 2013 City University of New York study. Statistically, the curbside Chinatown buses are often more dangerous than buses that originate from terminals. Still, many travelers were not discouraged. However, intercity bus accidents are quite rare.|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E

2500|$|Germany went a step further, {{laying down}} two new battleships, Bismarck in November 1935 and [...] in June 1936.

2500|$|... “The {{first time}} this thing ever got hit was when a young lady was driving home from the library at the University of Texas,” Sicking explains. “She was driving a small pickup truck with her cruise control set at highway speeds when she fell asleep and drifted off the road. She hit the {{guardrail}} at 65 or 70 miles per hour, and her only injury was a bruise across her chest caused by the seat belt. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> nice letter from her father describing the crash. He felt that she almost certainly would have been killed if she had hit {{one of the other}} common guardrail systems, and there is a high probability that he was right. But to hear that from a father whose daughter walked away unhurt—you live for moments like that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "playing {{with him}} was just frightening. It's a bit like an amateur guitar player from a back street who has just bought a Spanish guitar, working with Segovia.

He <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> raw deal from history... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella [...] and Louis Jordan.
