40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{elements of}} existing models {{to analyze the}} resolution of financial distress. As {{a result of a}} negative shock to project value, financial distress occurs in three stages: default-no default, reorganize-foreclose, sell the <b>foreclosed</b> <b>asset</b> immediately-delay the asset sale. Project level and sector-wide wealth level shocks are considered separately and together as they affect the resolution of financial distress. An important modeling result is that borrower default is endogenous; i. e., the anticipated outcome of default can determine whether or not default occurs in the first place. Additional model implications include that the reorganization-foreclosure decision depends crucially on the interaction between project value and industry liquidity and that the lender waits for the industry to recapitalize before selling assets obtained through foreclosure. An empirical analysis of a large sample of defaulted commercial real estate loans supports many of the predictions of the model − several of which are unique to the literature − including the existence of endogenous borrower default, significant underinvestment on foreclosed assets, and delayed asset sales in response to weak industry conditions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} theory of {{financial}} intermediation based on intermediaries' role in the reallocation of assets of distressed firms. The article suggests that intermediaries aggregate information on firms in credit relationships and use this information to facilitate asset reallocation across firms. However, this role of intermediaries hinges on debt contracts that grant lenders the right to <b>foreclose</b> <b>assets</b> of distressed borrowers and, hence, exclude the most productive asset users from the resale market. We characterise conditions under which intermediaries arise and under which {{their role in the}} credit market enhances their role as markets for firm assets. Copyright 2007 The Author(s).

40|$|This paper models a {{commercial}} real estate project where a wealth-constrained manager uses outside debt financing to purchase a project who's return depends on future economic conditions and the manager's investment in the project. It is shown that it is inefficient to finance the project with callable debt. This prediction is consistent with observed real estate financing practice. I also model the outcome of financial distress allowing for (1) debt forgiveness, (2) equity in exchange for debt forgiveness, and (3) foreclosure. The model motivates (1) why {{commercial real estate}} loans are often foreclosed, and (2) why lenders <b>foreclose</b> <b>assets</b> at fire-sale prices.

50|$|Tim {{began his}} career as a loan officer in 1993. He became President of a {{mortgage}} company in 1997. His company focused on either helping struggling property owners avoid foreclosure or helping banks liquidate <b>foreclosed</b> <b>assets.</b> In 2001 he joined Clayton, a due diligence firm. He traveled across the U.S. reviewing mortgage loans that were being sold and packaged into mortgage backed securities. Clayton was the largest due diligence firm in the United States. Tim was assigned to a client in Chicago during the rapid changes to different state anti=predatory laws. He developed an expertise for compliance testing and handled updating of the computer system used to verify compliance with federal, state, and local anti-predatory lending laws. He was promoted to head the compliance department. As investment banks were concerned with litigation risks of acquiring predatory loans, Clayton, under Winn’s leadership, became the industry leader in compliance testing and revenue soared. The company went public in 2006 and Tim left in 2007. In 2012, he founded Exponchal, a website that helps entrepreneurs for no charge with the documents to legally raised capital from investors.|$|R

Financial intermediaries appear to have {{a key role in the}} restructuring and liquidation of distressed firms. In particular, there is ample evidence that financial intermediaries are active in the reallocation of displaced capital. According to Sheard (1994, p. 203), in Japan A key part of reorganisation under main bank supervision or management is the implementation of a plan of asset sales with proceeds typically used to recover bank loans. Sheard (1994) surveys several cases in which, by exploiting their position at the core of industrial groups (keiretsu), main banks eased mergers of distressed firms with solvent ones or helped to identify buyers for liquidated assets within the keiretsu...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1856 Brunel advised the Eastern Company that they should take possession of the ship to avoid it being seized by Scott Russell's creditors. This caused Scott Russell's bankers to refuse to honour his cheques and <b>foreclose</b> on his <b>assets</b> and on 4 February Scott Russell suspended all payments to his creditors and dismissed all his workmen a week later.|$|R

One of its creditors, Silver Point Finance, soon filed to change the bankruptcy from a voluntary Chapter 11 to an involuntary Chapter 7 {{in an attempt to}} <b>foreclose</b> on Equity <b>assets,</b> as they felt {{that there was no way}} Equity could reorganize under Chapter 11, nor did they have enough funds to cover payroll.|$|R
50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Van Sweringens rose in the 1920s. By 1929, their holdings were valued at $3 billion, mostly {{as a result of}} the high valuation of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Their house of cards tumbled when the Great Depression began, causing the Van Sweringen companies to falter in the 1930s. While Shaker Heights rose to join the ranks of Beverly Hills and Wellesley, Massachusetts, the rail empire suffered financial difficulties. Loans were <b>foreclosed</b> upon and <b>assets</b> were sold to meet interest payments for their debts.|$|R

As the SAREB is not a bank, it cannot extend credit to potential buyers to facilitate asset purchases, but will be competing with banks which offer such financing to buyers of <b>foreclosed</b> and distressed <b>assets.</b> The terms of such financing arrangements should be competitive {{when compared with the}} terms offered by Spanish banks."
