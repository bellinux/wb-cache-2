Wipe {{the back of}} the slide clean and stand it in a <b>draining</b> <b>rack</b> to dry. The stained smear should grossly appear neither too pink nor too blue (verify final results microscopically). If the tap water is highly acidic, resulting in smear turning grossly pink too fast or highly alkaline, resulting in the smear remaining too blue, try using boiled cooled water or filtered rain water or pH 6.8 buffered water which can be used as an additional flooding step after washing in running water.|$|E

50|$|Made with flour, {{vegetable}} oil, yeast, sugar, salt, {{and water}} (street vendors use Alum {{to make it}} crisper : baking soda, ammonium bicarbonate, alum). Sift dry ingredients together, mix in oil and water. Knead the dough, let it rest in a warm area (in a covered bowl) for 1 hour. Punch down, knead dough. Place in a dusted bowl, covered tightly with cling wrap overnight in refrigerator. The next day, take out the dough and let it rest on your countertop (or warm area) for 2 hours to come to room temperature. On floured board, roll dough to (4 inch x 1/2 inch x 24 inch). Cut the dough into 48 strips, (4 inch x 1/2 inch). Place 48 strips in 24 pairs, {{one on top of}} each other. Heat a wok with about 2 cups oil hot enough for deep frying. Lightly press a joined strip in the lengthwise center with a chopstick, making the impression only immediately before frying, then stretch to 8 inch. Gently lower into hot oil. Turn the strips and push them into the oil so they cook right through and brown evenly. Donâ€™t fry too many at once as the temperature of the oil will drop, the dough will absorb more oil and become greasy. Fry until golden brown and puffy. Remove and <b>drain</b> on <b>rack</b> on paper.|$|R
