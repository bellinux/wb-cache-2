[...] "We had some <b>great</b> <b>stuff</b> go on with the first record, but I think the biggest thing {{over the past two years}} has been trying to make sure Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live.

500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed. Before becoming a screenwriter Hetreed worked as an editor, and credits this experience for knowing [...] "... about structure and {{what you need to}} say and what you can leave out. I am a big enthusiast for leaving things out." [...] She focused the story on the relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned.

In Cleveland, Paige struck out 13 while beating Dean 4–1, although for that game Dean was playing with a minor league team. Later, while playing in the California Winter League, Paige faced Dean in front of 18,000 fans in Los Angeles, with Dean's team including major league stars like Wally Berger. The two teams battled for thirteen innings, with Paige's team finally winning 1–0. Bill Veeck, future owner of the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, and Chicago White Sox, was watching the game and many years later described it as [...] "the greatest pitchers' battle I have ever seen."

[...] She later revealed that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was originally written for the film, but was mysteriously not included. However, according to producers, neither Lee or the band were approached to compose music for the film. Another song was also written for the movie, but it was rejected because of its dark sound.

Although feeling that the game does not live up to the standards set in , Game Informer still felt that the adventure is worthy of The Legend of Zelda series, and noted that it [...] "has enough <b>great</b> <b>stuff</b> going for it" [...] for them to consider it one of the year's best video game adventures. GameZone enjoyed the [...] "spectacular blend of touch-screen combat, brilliant puzzles, and Wind Waker beauty" [...] in Phantom Hourglass, calling it a [...] "can't-miss adventure" [...] and one of Nintendo's and the year's best games.

What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall.

Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film.
