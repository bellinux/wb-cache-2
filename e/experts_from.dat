5|$|In June 2005, {{a team of}} <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> the UK, Europe, Egypt, Russia and USA {{undertook}} a joint project to produce a new digital edition of the manuscript (involving all four holding libraries), {{and a series of}} other studies was announced. This will include the use of hyperspectral imaging to photograph the manuscripts to look for hidden information such as erased or faded text. This is to be done in cooperation with the British Library.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the ruling, some students created web-based publications not subsidized by the school. Some individual states have also responded with laws designating student newspapers as public forums and offering them greater First Amendment protection. <b>Experts</b> <b>from</b> the Student Press Law Center say the case has meant that fewer lawsuits regarding student censorship make it to court.|$|E

5|$|Mogadishu has {{historically}} {{served as a}} media hub. In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film regulatory body, was established in Mogadishu. The SFA also organized the annual Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis), which brought together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as Asia and Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} activity still continues, dropping volcanic ash on the surroundings. Earlier eruptions built the white sands highlands in the region. The most recent eruption started on May 2, 2017. On September 13, 2016 {{a team of}} <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre in Japan suggested that the volcano could have a major eruption within 30 years.|$|E
5|$|A British {{horsewoman}} named Francesca Kelly {{founded a}} group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, {{with the goal of}} promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a group that works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines {{for the management of}} natural fires.|$|E

5|$|Francois Fillon then visited Guadaloupe {{and brought}} with him a team of <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> the Ministry of the Interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage. The local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity. Other than the crop damage, the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage, {{both of which were}} quickly repaired.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the University of Art and Design Helsinki {{founded the}} Institute of Design Leadership and Management and {{established}} an international training program.

In 1995 the Helsinki School of Economics (HSE), University of Art and Design Helsinki (TaiK), and University of Technology (TKK) cooperated to create the International Design Business Management Program (IDBM), which aims to bring together <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> different fields within the concept of design business management.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Kagame began {{actively}} planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national consultation process and also sought {{the advice of}} <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> emerging nations including China, Singapore and Thailand. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020. These include reconstruction, infrastructure and transport improvements, good governance, improving agriculture production, private sector development, and health and education improvements.|$|E

Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer-range and smaller-calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden Field.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 2016, the Australian Transport Minister, Darren Chester, {{said that}} a piece of {{aircraft}} debris had been found on Pemba Island, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania.

The Australian government released photos of the piece, believed to be an outboard flap from one of the aircraft's wings, on 20 July. On 15 September, Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed that the debris came from the missing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally {{covered in a}} sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into {{the cause of the}} disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{earthquake}} and engineering <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> the United States spent {{a period of}} time in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also {{played a role in the}} unusually high death toll. The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his play}} during {{the high school}} {{basketball}} season, AAU tournaments and national summer camps, <b>experts</b> <b>from</b> ESPN RISE, ESPN College Basketball Recruiting and other talent evaluators selected him to the August 2010 Boost Mobile Elite 24 event.

At the event, his pass to Bello during the slam dunk contest appeared on SportsCenter. The following week, he played at the UIC Pavilion in the fourth annual adidas Nations global experience with many of the world's elite high school players. In the September 2010 ScoutsFocus Elite 80 All Star Game in Greensboro, North Carolina, after fans heckled him that his team was trailing, he rattled off 18 consecutive points.|$|E
