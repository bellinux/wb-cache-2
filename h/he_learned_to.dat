5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was well aware that latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|Newall {{began to}} turn towards a career in {{aviation}} in 1911, when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fly in a Bristol Biplane at Larkhill whilst on leave in England. He held certificate No. 144 issued by the Royal Aero Club. He later passed a formal course at the Central Flying School, Upavon in 1913, and began working as a pilot trainer there from 17 November 1913; it was intended that he would form part of a flight training school to be established in India, {{but he had not}} yet left England when the First World War broke out.|$|E

5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E

His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in.|$|E

Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately to the Army and Navy, which came into being on 31March 1921.|$|E
5|$|A {{modicum of}} {{stability}} during his childhood {{was provided by}} his aia (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, and by his aio (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both {{were in charge of}} Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French.

With {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War in June 1950, this mission acquired great importance. In July 1951 he assumed command of the 56th Fighter Interceptor Wing at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, part of the Air Defense Command, although he had never flown fighters before. <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fly the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre and Lockheed F-94 Starfire.

5|$|Crosby {{was born}} in the Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on August 7, 1987, to Troy and Trina (née Forbes) Crosby. Crosby's jersey number (87) and 2007 {{contract}} signing ($8.7million per year) reflect his birthdate (8/7/87). Crosby grew up in nearby Cole Harbour, and has a younger sister, Taylor. His father was a goaltender who played for the Verdun Junior Canadiens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Troy played in the 1985 Memorial Cup and had been drafted 240th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1984, but never played at the NHL level. Growing up, Crosby admired Steve Yzerman and, like his father, was a Canadiens fan. Crosby began playing hockey by himself in his basement at the age of two years, shooting pucks in a net that had the family dryer behind it, leading to a longstanding misconception that he was actually practising with the dryer; <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> skate at three.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{began his}} {{military}} training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in Neukuhren. On 1 March 1941, he progressed to the Luftkriegsschule 2 (Air War School 2) in Berlin-Gatow, {{making his first}} flight with an instructor four days later, followed in just under three weeks by his first solo flight. He completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre-fighter school 2 in Lachen-Speyerdorf on 1 November 1941. There, Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills. His advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942, and, between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the Jagdfliegerschule 2 (Fighter Pilot School 2) in Zerbst/Anhalt.|$|E
