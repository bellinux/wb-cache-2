40|$|We {{report the}} design of a {{variation}} of a <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> flexure system used for the measurement of displacement and force in surface force apparatus (SFA). The new force sensor is called dual <b>double</b> <b>cantilever.</b> The simple cantilever flexure suffers rotation, sideways deflection, and thermal expansion at the free end when loaded normally and asymmetrically. In the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> these errors are minimized to a second order. In the dual <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> flexure the stiffness is enhanced 16 times as that of a single cantilever flexure but the rotation, sideways deflection, and thermal expansion at the free end are brought to many orders below the instrument resolutions. The new design enables the measurement of deflection by optical and capacitive sensing methods. The stiffness and the strain of the aluminum alloy [AUG 1 (2024) ] flexure were estimated [dimensions, length (l= 50. 5 mm), breadth (b= 10. 5 mm), and thickness (t= 1. 2 mm) ] by finite element method and were also validated experimentally. The finite element method was also used to create a map for the selection of a flexure geometry relevant to the properties of material under investigation by a SFA or a nanoindenter...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{based on}} plate finite elements and the virtual crack closure technique has been implemented {{to study the}} effect of stitching on mode I and mode II strain energy release rates for debond configurations. The stitches were modeled as discrete nonlinear fastener elements with a compliance determined by experiment. The axial and shear behavior of the stitches was considered, however, the two compliances and failure loads were assumed to be independent. Both a <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam (mode I) and a mixed mode skin-stiffener debond configuration were studied. In the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam configurations, G(sub I) began to decrease once the debond had grown beyond the first row of stitches and was reduced to zero for long debonds. In the mixed-mode skin-stiffener configurations, G(sub I) showed a similar behavior as in the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam configurations, however, G(sub u), continued to increase with increasing debond length...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Three {{approaches}} for evaluating mode I interlaminar strain energy release rates in graphite/epoxy composites were compared using experimental data from <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam specimens. Expressions for evaluating strain energy release rates were arrived at based on assumptions regarding specimen geometry and material behavior. The calculations included the direct method of the J integral approach, a compliance calibrated approach and an analytical equation derived from small deflection, linear beam bending theory. The J integral approach accounts for both linear and nonlinear material response, whereas the compliance calibrated and linear beam bending methods assume linear material behavior. Experimental observations of several material systems indicated a nonlinear elastic material response. Interlaminar strain energy release rates {{were found to}} be overestimated by methods assuming linear material behavior. Permanent deflection was seen to accumulate in the arms of the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam specimen as the crack surface area increased. This component of deflection must be accounted for in all forms of analysis when using <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> beam specimens...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position. In the fourth step, an experiment was designed and conducted to explore the positioning accuracy and the repeatable positioning accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new test to determine flexibility of beam-to-column connectors used in conventional pallet racking systems. In this study, {{two different ways}} were used to find the flexibility of a connector. The connector developed was tested using the conventional cantilever method [Bajoria, KM. Three dimensional progressive collapse of warehouse racking, PhD Thesis, University of Cambridge, UK 1986], and then also using a newly proposed <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> method. To verify the results obtained from both the tests, a full scale frame test was carried out. In the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> test the connector is subjected to three types of forces namely moment, shear and the axial pull by the beams, thereby giving behavior close to practical usage of connectors. Non-linear finite element analysis of both the tests and also of the full scale test were carried out using ANSYS [ANSYS 7. 0 —User's Manual, ANSYS Inc., 2005] software. The results obtained from the <b>double</b> <b>cantilever</b> test were found to match well with the full scale frame test. The experimental results and the finite element results are compared in this paper. © Elsevie...|$|R
