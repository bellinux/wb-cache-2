500|$|Microsoft never {{formally}} {{commented on}} Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke. As a result, Cubitt questioned {{whether this was}} [...] "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" [...] Cubitt went on to state that [...] "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to produce the idea" [...] and as such was [...] "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements". Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.|$|E
500|$|For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda {{admitted}} {{he felt he}} was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a [...] "wall that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to get over again." [...] While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.|$|E

2500|$|George and Evangelia were an ill-matched {{couple from}} the beginning; he was easy-going and unambitious, with no {{interest}} in the arts, while his wife was vivacious and socially ambitious, and had held dreams of a life in the arts for herself, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth. Evangelia's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852-1916), was in failing health when Evangelia introduced George to her family and Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, [...] "You will never be happy with him. If you marry this man, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to help you". Evangelia had ignored his warning, but soon realized that her father was right. The situation was aggravated by George's philandering and was improved neither by the birth of a daughter, named Yakinthi (later called Jackie), in 1917 nor the birth of a son, named Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis's death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage. In 1923, after realizing that Evangelia was pregnant again, George made the unilateral decision to move his family to America, a decision which Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Evangelia [...] "shouting hysterically" [...] followed by George [...] "slamming doors". The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in Astoria, Queens.|$|E
