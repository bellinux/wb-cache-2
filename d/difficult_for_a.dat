5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ruler to exert {{the same degree of}} authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which {{allows them to}} lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|During 1923, a {{representative}} West Indian team toured England. Dewhurst {{was selected as}} wicket-keeper for the tour. He played in 15 games to score 182 runs {{at an average of}} 10.11, with one half-century: 52 against Nottinghamshire. Although not the team's official vice-captain, Dewhurst was very influential in the side. His performances as wicket-keeper were widely praised in the English press, and according to one team-mate from that tour, the bowling was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wicket-keeper to take. Despite competition from C. Piggott, whom many Trinidadians considered a superior wicket-keeper, Dewhurst secured his place as Trinidad's wicket-keeper after the tour. Many critics regarded Dewhurst as the best wicket-keeper in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in Budapest, Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of radium therapy, to introduce the techniques to Budapest, and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father, but Samuel believed that it would be too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman to attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest, studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before 312 BC, the Plebeian Council {{enacted the}} Plebiscitum Ovinium. During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. This initiative, however, {{transferred}} this {{power to the}} censors. It also required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, plebeians were already holding {{a significant number of}} magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only patricians were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed due to the organization of society. As such, only a revolution could overthrow this new structure.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also makes it more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet {{that it needs to}} force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E

5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E
5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation {{is a game}} feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction <b>difficult.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E

5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|The initial process {{offered by}} Steam Greenlight was panned because while {{developers}} favored the concept, {{the rate of}} games that are eventually approved by Valve is very small. At the time, Valve acknowledged {{that this was a}} problem and believed it could be improved upon it. In January 2013, Newell stated that Valve recognized that its role in Greenlight was perceived as a bottleneck, something the company was planning to eliminate in the future through an open marketplace infrastructure. On the eve of Greenlight's first anniversary, Valve simultaneously approved 100 titles through the Greenlight process to demonstrate this change of direction. While the Greenlight service had helped to bring more and varied games onto Steam without excessive bureaucracy, it also led to an excessively large number of games on the service that make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single title to stand out, and as early as 2014, Valve had discussed plans to phase out the Greenlight process in favor of providing developers with easier means to put their games onto the Steam service.|$|E

5|$|The lack of radial nodes in the 2p {{subshell}} {{is directly}} responsible {{for many of the}} anomalous properties of the first row of the p-block, especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating orbital hybridisation. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. Hypervalency is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.|$|E
5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E
5|$|Warfare in Normandy at {{the time}} was shaped by the {{defensive}} potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Château Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries.|$|E
