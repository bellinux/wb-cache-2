40|$|A {{majority}} of neurons {{that form the}} ventral nerve cord send out long axons that cross the midline through anterior or posterior commissures. A smaller fraction <b>extend</b> <b>longitudinally</b> and never cross the midline. The decision to cross the midline is governed by a balance of attractive and repulsive signals.

40|$|Imaging riometers at Ny-Alesund (NYA) and Danmarkshavn (DMH) in the Arctic and Zhongshan (ZHS) in Antarctica {{were used}} to examine {{conjugate}} features of daytime ionospheric absorption in the polar cusp/cleft for specific changes in solar wind plasma parameters and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).

40|$|Objective: To <b>extend</b> <b>longitudinally</b> {{an earlier}} study of the pathway from {{symptoms}} of emotional distress (ED) through self-efficacy (SE) and adherence to glycemic control (GC) in youths with diabetes, and to examine the contribution of different specific adherence behaviors to changes in GC. Methods: Fifty-six Hong Kong youths with diabetes received a follow-up evaluation 12 - 24 months after initial participation. ED, SE, self-reported adherence to medical regimen (SRA), and GC were assessed at both evaluations. Results: The pathway from ED to SE to SRA to GC was replicated. Participants' SRA to regular checks on blood glucose levels, and taking steps to maintain levels in the recommended range, explained significant variance in changes in GC. Conclusions: The model offers strategies to enhance health care in youths with diabetes. Findings support the importance of adherence to the medical regimen but emphasize {{the complexity of the}} relationship between adherence behaviors and GC.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin {{controls}} root epidermal cell {{development in a}} concentration-dependent manner 1, 2, 3. Root hairs are produced on a subset of epidermal cells as they increase in distance from the root tip. Auxin is required for their initiation 4, 5, 6, 7 and continued growth 8, 9, 10, 11, but {{little is known about}} its distribution in this region of the root. Contrary to the expectation that hair cells might require active auxin influx to ensure auxin supply, we did not detect the auxin-influx transporter AUX 1 in root-hair cells. A high level of AUX 1 expression was detected in adjacent non-hair cell files. Non-hair cells were necessary to achieve wild-type root-hair length, although an auxin response was not required in these cells. Three-dimensional modelling of auxin flow in the root tip suggests that AUX 1 -dependent transport through non-hair cells maintains an auxin supply to developing hair cells as they increase in distance from the root tip, and sustains root-hair outgrowth. Experimental data support the hypothesis that instead of moving uniformly though the epidermal cell layer 3, 12, auxin is mainly transported through canals that <b>extend</b> <b>longitudinally</b> into the tissue...|$|E
40|$|Myosin V motors are {{believed}} to contribute to cell polarization by carrying cargoes along actin tracks. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Myosin Vs transport secretory vesicles along actin cables, which are dynamic actin bundles assembled by the formin For 3 at cell poles. How these flexible structures are able to <b>extend</b> <b>longitudinally</b> in the cell through the dense cytoplasm is unknown. Here we show that in myosin V (myo 52 myo 51) null cells, actin cables are curled, bundled, and fail to extend into the cell interior. They also exhibit reduced retrograde flow, suggesting that formin-mediated actin assembly is impaired. Myo 52 may contribute to actin cable organization by delivering actin regulators to cell poles, as myoV defects are partially suppressed by diverting cargoes toward cell tips onto microtubules with a kinesin 7 -Myo 52 tail chimera. In addition, Myo 52 motor activity may pull on cables to provide the tension necessary for their extension and efficient assembly, as artificially tethering actin cables to the nuclear envelope via a Myo 52 motor domain restores actin cable extension and retrograde flow in myoV mutants. Together these in vivo data reveal elements of a self-organizing {{system in which the}} motors shape their own tracks by transporting cargoes and exerting physical pulling forces...|$|E
