50|$|Microservices is {{a variant}} of the service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services should be fine-grained and the protocols should be lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop and test. It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.

However, software vendors can greatly improve their product quality and quality of service by applying a model that focuses on customer interaction if such a model were available.

Finally, organisational and architectural changes are proposed to increase quality of service and product quality for software vendors. 1 Customer-Vendor Interaction With the advent of increased amounts of bandwidth the communication between software vendors and their customers can greatly be improved by introducing automatic error feedback reporting, usage feedback reporting, electronic customer feedback, as well as license, patch, and update distribution. Whereas in the past customers and vendors could only communicate by mail and phone, the World Wide Web can now function as a lifeline between customers and software vendors, to allow for automatic license retrieval, deployment and error feedback, automatic updates, and automatic provision of commercial information to customers.

In addition to the books there is information available based on miscellaneous conferences and scientific publishments, but this information is fairly scattered and hard to compile. A lot of companies suffer from long delays between implementing and delivering software features. Multiple parties ranging from foreign developers to Finnish leader projects have researched the benefits that can be gained from automating and making software delivery continuous. Benefits include among other things rapid customer feedback, lowered production delivery costs and delays, and smaller number of errors in processes.
