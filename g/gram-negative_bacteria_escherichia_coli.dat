5000|$|The secalonic {{family of}} {{secondary}} metabolite mycotoxins exhibit interesting bioactivities. Secalonic acid A has antitumor properties and also reduces colchicines toxicity in rat cortical neurons. [...] In addition {{it has been}} demonstrated that secalonic acid A protects against dopaminergic neuron death in a Parkinson's disease mouse model. [...] Secalonic acid B also has antitumor activity. When tested against B16 murine melanoma it {{was found to be}} active in the low micromolar range. [...] It also proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium) and the <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> (<b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli)</b> and was found to be antifungal against (Microbotryum violaceum) and antialgal against (Chlorella fusca). Secalonic acid D (SAD) is a toxic and teratogenic metabolite. Teratogenic effects were observed in the development of rats that were exposed to SAD injected during fetal development. [...] SAD exhibited potent cytotoxicity on multidrug resistance (MDR) cells and their parental cells. Investigation of the antitumor activity of SAD showed that it exerted potent cytotoxic activity on SP cells, due to induction of ABCG2 degradation by calpain-1 activation. [...] Ergoflavin showed good anti-inflammatory activity and good anticancer activities including significant inhibition of proliferation particularly in pancreatic, renal, and lung cancer cells, and may be exerting its effects via mechanisms similar to those of secalonic acid D.|$|E

30|$|In the <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli,</b> cadaverine is biosynthesized {{directly}} from L-lysine by {{two kinds of}} L-lysine decarboxylases: a constitutive one encoded by the ldcC gene, and an inducible one produced at low pH encoded by the cadA gene. The level of cadaverine in E. coli is regulated by biosynthesis, degradation, uptake, and export (Soksawatmaekhin et al. 2004). It was recently shown that E. coli can tolerate a higher concentration of cadaverine, just slightly lower than that tolerated by a wild-type Corynebacterium glutamicum strain (Mimitsuka et al. 2007; Qian et al. 2011). This high tolerance suggests that microorganisms can be metabolically engineered to overproduce cadaverine to industrially useful levels.|$|R
