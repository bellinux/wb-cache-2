5000|$|The {{popular in}} 20th century {{scholarly}} interpretation, for instance, summarized in the textbook by Katsva and Yurganov, is that [...] "Rurik, Sineus, en Truvor" [...] {{should be read}} [...] "Rurik, sine hus, en tro(gna) vär(ingar)" [...] (Rurik, his house/relatives, and true companions). However modern linguistical <b>expertize</b> shows that [...] "sine hus" [...] and [...] "thru varing" [...] contradict basic morphology and syntax of old Scandinavian dialects, and could never be translated as [...] "our faithful" [...] and [...] "his households". On the other hand, historians of 19th century (A.Kunik, N.Belyaev, et al.) had already found common old Scandinavian names Signjótr and Þórvarðr, which fit well with [...] "Sineus" [...] and [...] "Truvor" [...] by Nestor's transcription.|$|E

In 2012, the Italian prison authorities inquired with various Italian wineries about partnering with the penal colony to produce wine. Lamberto Frescobaldi, the current Marchesi de'Frescobaldi and 30th generation of the Tuscan winemaking family, saw potential in an east-facing 2.5 acre plot of land on the island's mineral-rich vineyard soils and decided to purchase the land.

50|$|During the Apollo 13 emergency, U.S. {{contractor}} Grumman Aerospace Corp., which {{built the}} lunar module for NASA, asked the University of Toronto for help specifically {{in how to}} jettison the lunar module just prior to re-entry. A team of six engineers at the university was formed - led by Etkin as the senior scientist - {{to solve the problem}} in one day using nothing more than slide rules and collective <b>expertize.</b> (Besides Etkin, the team also consisted of Rod Tennyson, Barry French, Philip Sullivan, Peter Hughes, a specialist in orbital mechanics, and another senior scientist, Irvine Glass, a specialist in shock waves.) Given that a small tunnel connected the lunar module to the command module, the team concluded that if they closed the tunnel hatch and pressurized the tunnel, the astronauts could explosively separate the lunar module and blow it away from the command module just prior to re-entry. The scientists had 6 hours to compute the pressure required using slide-rules. They needed a precise calculation as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal causing the astronauts to burn up; too low, and the lunar module would not separate from the command module. The resulting calculation was relayed by Grumman to NASA, and from there to the astronauts who implemented the solution.|$|E
