40|$|Usage control generalizes {{access control}} {{to what happens}} to data in the future. We {{contribute}} to the enforcement of usage control requirements {{at the level of}} system calls by also taking into account data flow: <b>Restrictions</b> on the <b>dissemination</b> of data, for instance, as stipulated by data protection regulations, of course relate not to just one file containing the data, but likely to all copies of that file as well. In order to enforce the <b>dissemination</b> <b>restrictions</b> on all copies of the sensitive data item, we introduce a data flow model that tracks how the content of a file flows through the system (files, network sockets, main memory). By using this model, the existence of potential copies of the data is reflected {{in the state of the}} data flow model. This allows us to enforce the <b>dissemination</b> <b>restrictions</b> by relating to the state rather than all sequences of events that possibly yield copies. Generalizing this idea, we describe how usage control policies can be expre ssed in a related state-based manner. Finally, we present an implementation of the data flow model and state-based policy enforcement as well as first encouraging performance measurements...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{agencies}} that own different databases on overlapping subjects can benefit greatly from combining their data. These benefits are {{passed on to}} secondary data analysts when the combined data are disseminated to the public. Sometimes combining data across agencies or sharing these data with the public is not possible: {{one or both of}} these actions may break promises of confidentiality that have been given to data subjects. We describe an approach that is based on two stages of multiple imputation that facilitates data sharing and <b>dissemination</b> under <b>restrictions</b> of confidentiality. We present new inferential methods that properly account for the uncertainty that is caused by the two stages of imputation. We illustrate the approach by using artificial and genuine data.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the evolution of Brazilian academic publication regarding the term communities of practice, to identify their growth over time, as well as transformations of the concept and conceptual forms used. To this end, we begin with the emergence of the concept of communities of practice through a general review of the classical texts that address the issue. Next, we detail our methodological approaches, which included bibliometric techniques and contextual analysis. The results show that the classic texts discussed in the theoretical part of this article are commonly referenced (bibliometrics) in Brazilian academic production. Despite this, it is evident that, in terms of <b>dissemination,</b> extension, <b>restriction</b> or limitation of the use of the communities of practice concept, there are conceptual modifications linking this concept more with researchers’ purposes and their research than, necessarily, the compatibility of this concept to what is established in the literature on the theme...|$|R
40|$|CBW Conventions BulletinThe {{events of}} 11 September 2001 and the anthrax letters have reignited the longstanding debate over {{scientific}} openness and national security. And {{for the first}} time, the life sciences community {{is the focus of}} concern. Recent proposals for self-governance are unlikely to provide sufficient reassurance that information, {{in the words of the}} Corson Report, "not directly and significantly connected with technology critical to national security" is not disclosed. A more formalized system for considering the security implications of biodefence and other dual-use research, including specific criteria for making decisions on <b>dissemination</b> <b>restrictions</b> or classification, is needed in order to maintain support for the very endeavours on which both public health and national security depend. Fear of bioterrorism has emerged as a priority concern of American security policy as a result of the anthrax letters of 2001. That event resonating with the September 11 terrorist attacks crystallized a much more urgent sense of threat than had previously been perceived. It is now commonly assumed that malicious organizations will attempt to exploit the destructive potential of biotechnology, and it is also implicitly conceded that a dedicated effort is likely to succeed. In response to this surge of fear, the American political system has sharply increased investment in biodefence research intended to provide protection against deliberate biological attack. Nowhere is this more true than at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which has seen its funding for biodefence grow by over 3, 200 %, from $ 53 million in fiscal year 2001 to a record $ 1. 8 billion (requested) in fiscal year 2006. 2 These funds have resulted in a 1, 500 % increase in the number of grants for research on anthrax, plague and other top biological warfare agents, from 33 between 1996 - 2000, to almost 500 between 2001 and January 2005. 3 This research is dedicated to determining the character and magnitude of potential threat in order to develop better methods of protection. But at least some of this effort will assuredly identify more advanced methods of attack as well.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen {{tremendous}} developments in information production, acquisition, and <b>dissemination.</b> Budgetary <b>restrictions</b> in research libraries {{have led to a}} period known as the serial cutting era. The new millennium has also ushered in the concept of the virtual library with seamless access to an integrated collection of print, electronic, and multimedia resources regardless of their physical location or ownership. Research scientists, policy makers, and reference librarians the world over are coming together to introduce reforms to make scientific knowledge affordable. Providing access to information free of charge in electronic formats is a concept that is gaining momentum. Open Access is one step ahead of Free Access. Open Access holds promise to remove both price and permission barriers to the scientific communication by using Internet. The present paper outlines the features of open access and the two vehicles viz. open access journals and open access archives. A few current open access initiatives in India are described in detail. In India, there is a large opportunity for open access publishing but still the number of registered archives is very less. Indian scientific communities and organizations like Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Indian National Science Academy, NISCAIR, INFLIBNET, etc are now actively taking initiatives towards creation of institutional repositories and providing open access to their publications...|$|R
40|$|Law’s {{relations}} to art [...] to its creation, its production, and <b>dissemination,</b> its <b>restriction</b> {{as well as}} to commercial and contractual agreements about art works—are as multiform and complex as the category of art itself. Acknowledging that there is no discrete body of law that governs art, the author defines art law as “the survey of legal issues raised by art, artist, and the art world” and surveys four central themes: the law as art, the law of art, the law of creativity, and the collision of art and law. Any legal dispute about art usually evokes a plea for special legal rules or approaches, {{as in the case of}} Nussenzweig v. diCorcia, 878 N. E. 2 d 589 (2006). The author points the way toward a study of law in its relationship to creative, cultural practices, particularly to the notion of aesthetic judgment in the domains of art and law. Law typically works to promote and protect, rather than impede, artistic creation on the logic that art is a social good. Questions about art’s role in the creation of culture and the rights of the artist frequently enter the legal domain for their answers. In cases of illegal trade of art treasures, for example, the courts have had to decide whether art constitutes a specific cultural heritage, a broader human achievement, or simply a commodity. Controversies in intellectual property, though they focus on the individual artist, are similarly bound up with creative and economic interests that reveal fundamental inconsistencies between law’s stated mission to encourage the production of art as a common good and law’s so-called creativity threshold, which works to restrict innovation. The author sees in these inconsistencies a collision between art (radically transformative) and law (resistant to change) based on their fundamentally differently cultural functions, and argues that judges apply private ideas about aesthetics instead of openly acknowledging that their judgments are not neutral and nonsubjective.

40|$|Problem: The {{association}} between personality and traffic accident involvement {{has been extensively}} researched, but the literature is difficult to summarize, because different personality instruments and statistics have been used, and effect sizes differ strongly between studies. Method: A meta-analysis of studies which had used measures of personality which could be converted into Big Five dimensions, and traffic accidents as the dependent variable, was undertaken. Analysis: Outlier values were identified and removed. Also, analyses on effects of common method variance, type of instrument, <b>dissemination</b> bias and <b>restriction</b> of variance were undertaken. Results: Outlier problems exist in these data, which prohibit any certainty in the conclusions. Each of the 5 personality dimensions were predictors of accident involvement, but the effects were small (r<. 1), which is much weaker than in a previous meta-analysis. Effect sizes were dependent upon variance in the accident variable, and the true (population) effects could therefore be larger than the present estimates, something which could be ascertained by new studies using high-risk samples over longer time periods. Newer studies and those using Big Five instruments tended to have smaller effects. No effects of common method variance could be found. Conclusions: Tests of personality are weak predictors of traffic accident involvement, compared to other variables, such as previous accidents. Research into whether larger effects of personality can be found with methods other than self-reports is needed...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{personal}} {{liberty in}} psychiatric care from a service user involvement perspective. The {{data were collected}} in four phases during the period 2000 - 2006 in psychiatric settings in Finland. Firstly, patient satisfaction and factors associated with user involvement were studied (n = 313). Secondly, patients’ experiences of deprivation of their liberty were explored (n = 51). Thirdly, an overview on patients’ options for lodging complaints was conducted, and all complaints (n = 4645) lodged in Finland from 2000 to 2004 were examined. Fourthly, the effects of different patient education methods on inpatients’ experiences of deprivation of liberty were tested (n = 311). It emerged that patients were quite satisfied, but reported dissatisfaction in restrictions, compulsory care and information <b>dissemination.</b> Patients experienced <b>restrictions</b> on leaving the ward and on communication, confiscation of property and coercive measures as deprivation of liberty. Patients’ experienced these interventions to be negative. In Finland, the patient complaint process is complicated and not easily accessible. In general, patient complaints increased considerably in Finland during the study period. In psychiatric care the number of complaints was quite stable and complaints led more seldom to consequences. An Internet-based patient education system was equivalent with traditional education and treatment as usual in supporting personal liberty during hospital care. This dissertation provides new information about the realization of patients' rights in psychiatric care. In order to improve patients' involvement, systematic methods to increase personal liberty during care need to be developed, the procedures for patients lodging complaints should be simplified, and patients' access to information needs to be ensured using multiple methods...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} attitudes toward {{counseling}} about sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and other epilepsy risk factors among Austrian, German, and Swiss neurologists and neuropediatricians, {{and to determine}} factors associated with not discussing SUDEP. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to approximately 5, 000 neurologists and neuropediatricians in 2014 regarding respondents' demographics, their working environments, and how often they discussed SUDEP, suicidal ideations on anticonvulsive medication, driving restrictions, and risks in daily life activities. RESULTS: In total, 519 surveys were completed (respondents' mean age: 45. 5 years, 41. 6 % female, 66. 9 % adult neurologists, 31. 0 % neuropediatricians). A minority of 2. 7 % reported that they counseled all of their patients on SUDEP, 8. 7 % counseled {{most of the time}} (50 - 90 %), 20. 8 % sometimes (10 - 49 %), 44. 5 % rarely (1 - 9 %), and 23. 3 % reported not counseling about SUDEP at all. In contrast, 92. 9 % reported that they counseled all patients about driving restrictions and 81. 5 % about risks in daily life activities. Suicidal ideations were discussed in 59. 0 % for some and in 3. 3 % for all patients, whereas 35. 1 % of respondents reported never discussing suicidal ideations. Independent predictors of not discussing SUDEP were no additional epilepsy training, no or uncertain SUDEP cases in the past, < 10 years in practice, < 25 epilepsy patients seen per quarter, and the opinion of a lack of consequences in SUDEP prevention. The opinion that SUDEP is a risk factor in particular patient groups and the attitude that all risks should be discussed predicted counseling on SUDEP. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show a discrepancy between guidelines and practice regarding the discussion of premature mortality due to SUDEP or suicidality. Both are not discussed at all by a substantial proportion of neurologists and neuropediatricians. This is in contrast to ubiquitous education about driving <b>restrictions.</b> <b>Dissemination</b> of knowledge among physicians about potential preventive strategies might increase the likelihood of discussion. Clinical practice guidelines are welcomed by the majority of physicians in this process...|$|R
