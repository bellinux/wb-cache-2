40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of bucky <b>paper</b> <b>interleaves</b> made from carbon {{nanofiber}} (CNF) on mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites (CFRPs). The CNF bucky papers were fabricated by vacuum filtration of functionalized CNF-acetone dispersion. Three different techniques were used to impregnate the bucky papers with epoxy resin, including simple soaking, hot compression and vacuum infiltration. Partially cured bucky papers containing about 10 wt% CNFs were then integrated into carbon fiber prepregs to produce CFRP hybrid composites with bucky <b>paper</b> <b>interleaves.</b> It is revealed that the vacuum infiltration technique resulted in the best quality of polymer intercalation among the three methods used to impregnate the bucky papers. The mode-II fracture toughness of the corresponding CNF bucky <b>paper</b> <b>interleaved</b> hybrid composites increased by about 104 % whereas the corresponding interlaminar shear strength improved by about 31 % compared to the composites without interleaves. Fracture surfaces were examined on a SEM and an optical microscope to identify the pertinent mechanisms involved in toughening and strengthening of CFRP composites. The significance {{of this paper is}} that the technique developed here can be used to incorporate CNFs of high contents to strengthen/toughen at failure prone locations in CFRP composites, which has not been possible previously because of the high viscosity caused by simple dispersion of randomly-oriented CNFs in a polymer resin...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} bucky <b>paper</b> <b>interleaves</b> made from carbon nanofibers on interlaminar shear {{properties}} of carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRPs) are studied. The study includes fabrication of bucky papers, resin impregnation by different techniques, i. e., soaking, hot-compression and vacuum filtration, followed by beta-stage curing and the integration with carbon fiber prepregs to produce CFRP composites with bucky <b>paper</b> <b>interleaves.</b> The vacuum infiltration technique {{results in the}} best quality of polymer impregnation through bucky papers. Remarkable 31 % and 104 % improvements in interlaminar shear strength and mode-II shear interlaminar fracture toughness of the multiscale composites, respectively, are achieved with the incorporation of interleaves at failure-prone locations. The pertinent mechanisms responsible for the ameliorating effects of interleaves include improved interfacial adhesion and matrix shear strength for the interlaminar strengthening and crack-tip bridging and meandering for the toughening. The present technique {{can be used to}} incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or carbon nanofibers (CNFs) of high contents to strengthen/toughen at selective locations in FRP composites, which has not been possible previously because of the high viscosity caused by randomly-oriented CNTs/CNFs in a polymer resin.

Robust, static {{disassembly}} is {{an important}} part of achieving high coverage for many binary code analyses, such as reverse engineering, malware analysis, reference monitor in-lining, and software fault isolation. However, one of the major difficulties current disassemblers face is differentiating code from data when they are <b>interleaved.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents a machine learning-based disassembly algorithm that segments an x 86 binary into subsequences of bytes and then classifies each subsequence as code or data. The algorithm builds a language model from a set of pre-tagged binaries using a statistical data compression technique. It sequentially scans a new binary executable and sets a breaking point at each potential code-to-code and code-to-data/data-to-code transition. The classification of each segment as code or data is based on the minimum cross-entropy. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm...|$|R

The technique approximates the lines of heat flow through the coil by a system of lines that can be analysed by one-dimensional heat transfer theory. Methods are described for determining the properties of the constituents of the coil that are required for the calculation of the conductivity, and the results of experiments are given that show that the accuracy of the theoretical prediction of the conductivity is better than + - 15 % of that obtained by direct test upon the coil.

5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain <b>paper</b> <b>interleaved</b> with carbon <b>paper.</b> The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{increasing}} numbers of automatic warehousing systems using computer-controlled stacker cranes have been installed. Our research concerns the scientific scheduling and design of these systems. There are three elements to scheduling: the assignment of multiple items to the same pallet (Pallet Assignment); the assignment of pallet loads to storage locations (Storage Assignment); and rules for sequencing storage and retrieve requests (<b>Interleaving).</b> This <b>paper</b> deals with optimal storage assignment. Results are obtained which compare the operating performance of three storage assignment rules: random assignment, {{which is similar to}} the closest-open-location rule used by many currently operating systems; full turnover-based assignment: and class-based turnover assignment. It is shown that significant reductions in crane travel time (and distance) are obtainable from turnover-based rules. These improvements can, under certain circumstances, be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems, and may be used to alter the design (e. g., size and number of racks, speed of cranes, etc.) of proposed systems in order to achieve a more desirable system balance between throughput and storage capacity. ...|$|R
