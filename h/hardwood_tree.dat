5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other <b>hardwood</b> <b>tree</b> species.|$|E

The Archaic period lasted from 8000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.|$|E
500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is {{a common}} species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae with a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. The fruit bodies of the saprobe typically grow in clusters on or near rotting <b>hardwood</b> <b>tree</b> stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the tawny-brown mushroom caps may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to [...] The caps, marked with fine radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish stems up to [...] long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective mica-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's species name and the common names mica cap, shiny cap, and glistening inky cap. Although small and with thin flesh, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the gills will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, spore-laden liquid—an enzymatic process called autodigestion or deliquescence. The fruit bodies are edible before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.|$|E
