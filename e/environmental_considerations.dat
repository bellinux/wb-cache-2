40|$|Products {{generate}} {{environmental impacts}} during their life cycle by consuming {{raw materials and}} energy, releasing emissions and producing waste. A procurement organisation can be a considerable driving force for more environmentally friendly products e. g. by requiring that products meet certain environmental criteria. The scope for <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> when procuring materiel can be limited by lack of reliable information about the environmental characteristics of the product or service. Different types of tools (e. g. eco-labels, guidelines, checklists and tools for environmental assessment) can contribute some knowledge and help identify environmentally preferable products. This thesis focuses on use of tools for <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in Swedish defence acquisition but the results are also relevant for other organisations, since the procurement process analysed is rather general and the legal requirements are similar for other public organisations in Europe. A Swedish government decision in 1998 requires the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF) and Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) to take <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in all phases of the acquisition process. The importance of a life cycle perspective is stressed in several SAF and FMV environmental documents. The starting point of this thesis was that <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> should be taken in the Swedish acquisition of defence materiel, considering the whole life cycle of products, {{with the aim of}} formulating proposals on environmentally friendly procurement. Some Ecodesign tools were reviewed and evaluated, two methods for simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were compared, tools and methodology were recommended, and used to study military materiel, and environmental Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was examined. In environmental work lacking a life cycle perspective, the most significant aspects risk being overlooked. Use of quantitative and/or simplified LCAs and inclusion of environmental costs in LCC are therefore recommended. LCA proved an appropriate tool for involving <b>environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> in the acquisition process, since it focuses on products and their life cycle. The MECO method proved best for simplified LCA. These suggested methods were evaluated by interviews with actors in the acquisition process. Four areas for LCA use in acquisition were identified: learning about environmental aspects of products; fulfilling customer requirements; setting environmental requirements; and choosing between alternatives. The interviewees were interested in using LCA, but {{there is a need for}} an initiative by one or several actors if the method is to be used regularly and the results must be communicated within the organisations involved in procurement. <b>Environmental</b> <b>consideration</b> should be taken early in the acquisition process and environmental matters integrated into other activities of the organisations involved. Environmental costs are not explicitly considered in the LCCs used by the interviewees today, but internal environmental costs should be included. Costs likely to be internal can also be included.

25|$|For forest managers, {{sustainably}} {{managing a}} particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, {{how to use}} it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors – commercial and non-commercial values, <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations,</b> community needs, even global impact – to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed. The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices.|$|E
25|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> of wine {{packaging}} reveal {{benefits and}} drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energies}} {{and renewable energy}} technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts.

Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company. A happier workforce is a more productive workforce.|$|E

25|$|When {{originally}} {{built in}} the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottomans had the advantage of constructing the railway in what was then a relatively sparsely-populated area and as such had the benefit of being able to lay the railway on the most topographically convenient route between Haifa and Beit She'an. The renewed railway's route however had to contend with the significant population that settled in the area since, a complex set of existing infrastructure built up over the years, strict <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations,</b> and the wish to preserve as much open space as possible along the route. Therefore, the new route was in places considerably more difficult to construct and in some spots is also less direct than the original alignment.|$|E
25|$|A {{precondition}} for further commercialization of GM forest trees {{is likely to}} be their complete sterility. Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of transgene escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is their potential for wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce {{for a long time before}} being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special <b>environmental</b> <b>considerations</b> over GM crops. Ensuring sterility for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.|$|E
