500|$|Barbirolli's {{repertoire}} {{was not as}} wide as that of many of {{his colleagues}} because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: [...] "We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> they're only sporting events." [...] Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, [...] "it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade." [...] He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.|$|E

60|$|We {{were all}} rather {{glad that the}} {{champion}} was obliged to be absent. Here was a chance <b>for</b> <b>some</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to win the badge.

"Young Lambert is a bookworm, your Honor," [...] {{suggested}} Pyot, who was keen on the business, {{seeing that}} his zeal, if accompanied by success, would surely mean promotion; [...] "there'll be ink and {{paper in the}} cottage....

"I {{wish to make}} it clear," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{in spite}} of the pain Mr. Hodder's words of last Sunday have given me, I respect and honour him still, and wish him every success.

6000|$|Arnold took a stool at Blanche's feet, {{and opened}} the [...] "First Book" [...] of Paradise Lost. His [...] "system" [...] as a reader of blank verse was {{simplicity}} itself.

60|$|The {{breath of}} Easter {{was in the}} air. It was hard, even in that last penitential week, to renounce the seductive wooings of those first April days. In the little Episcopal chapel, or in the venerable Mission, we {{acknowledged}} each evening our infirmities; but with all our abnegation, there was <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> an heterodox satisfaction in hastening away from our prayers.|$|E
60|$|We {{followed}} this good advice, {{and at the}} top of our speed we endeavored to get between the beast and the trees. To a certain extent we succeeded in our object, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were fast runners, and Orso, perceiving that he might be cut off from a woody retreat, turned almost at right angles and made directly for the house.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{formidable}} industrial and manufacturing powerhouse serving the entire United States, the nationwide decline of this {{industry in the}} late 20th century and early 2000s led the Lehigh Valley to shift its economic focus more towards financial services, health care, life sciences and technology as well as becoming a distribution hub <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the largest <b>U.S.</b> markets due to its comparatively low cost of living and proximity to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the nation's largest metropolitan areas.|$|R
60|$|Our {{guns were}} pointed instantly. I am {{ashamed to say}} that we were guilty of {{shooting}} them as they stood!

Nay, more, we tried to get as many of the birds in line as possible, so as {{to make the most of}} our ammunition. We were not sportsmen in the civilised sense of that term.|$|R

60|$|It may be, I say, that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> forgetting is {{the normal}} process, {{that one has}} to believe and forget and blunder and learn {{something}} and regret and suffer and so come again to belief much as we have to eat and grow hungry and eat again.

6000|$|... "You see," [...] said he, [...] "there {{is nothing}} now {{for us to}} wait for here. As to being taken off by a passing vessel, {{there is no chance}} of that whatever.

60|$|But now {{the moment}} {{approached}} {{for the performance}} to commence. M. Paul, setting us before him, harangued us briefly, like a general addressing soldiers about to charge.

60|$|Do you {{not know}} what frame of mind I mean?

50|$|Adams {{moved the}} country in the {{direction}} of Margaret Thatcher's Britain and Ronald Reagan's United States, reflecting the conservatism of the early 1980s. This alliance found its greatest expression when Tom Adams was the leading proponent in the grouping of Eastern Caribbean states that asked Reagan to intervene in overthrowing the Cuban-backed communist regime of Bernard Coard, who had toppled Maurice Bishop, who was later murdered, in Grenada. Barbados was used as a staging point <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> forces, and a nominal contingent of the Barbados Defence Force accompanied in the invasion force's wake, not least to allow (as Barrow claimed) Reagan to gild the statistics. The Barbadian population was of two minds about Adams' move, generally conceding that Bishop's murder had moved Grenada too far, but being uneasy with Reagan's US heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, Adams' BLP was tipped to win the upcoming elections at the time.|$|R
25|$|For {{everyone}} else, {{health insurance}} {{must be paid}} <b>for</b> privately. <b>Some</b> 59% <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> residents have {{access to health care}} insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely. Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, {{as well as those who}} are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.|$|R
