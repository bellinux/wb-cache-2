50|$|Lethal {{intracellular}} freezing can {{be avoided}} if cooling is slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. To minimize the growth of extracellular ice crystal growth and recrystallization, biomaterials such as alginates, poly vinyl alcohol or chitosan {{can be used to}} impede ice crystal growth along with traditional small molecule cryoprotectants. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate of about 1 °C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphoxide,</b> but the rate is not a universal optimum. The 1 °C / minute rate can be achieved by using devices such as a rate-controlled freezer or a benchtop portable freezing container.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} early theoreticians of cryopreservation was James Lovelock (born 1919) known for Gaia theory. He suggested that damage to red blood cells during freezing was due to osmotic stress. During the early 1950s, Lovelock had also suggested that increasing salt concentrations in a cell as it dehydrates to lose water to the external ice might cause damage to the cell. Cryopreservation of tissue during recent times began with the freezing of fowl sperm, which during 1957 was cryopreserved by a team of scientists in the UK directed by Christopher Polge. The process was applied to humans during the 1950s with pregnancies obtained after insemination of frozen sperm. However, the rapid immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen did not, for certain of these samples - such as types of embryos, bone marrow and stem cells - produce the necessary viability to make them usable after thawing. Increased understanding of the mechanism of freezing injury to cells emphasised the importance of controlled or slow cooling to obtain maximum survival on thawing of the living cells. A controlled-rate cooling process, allowing biological samples to equilibrate to optimal physical parameters osmotically in a cryoprotectant (a form of anti-freeze) before cooling in a predetermined, controlled way proved necessary. The ability of cryoprotectants, in the early cases glycerol, to protect cells from freezing injury was discovered accidentally. Freezing injury has two aspects: direct damage from the ice crystals and secondary damage caused by the increase in concentration of solutes as progressively more ice is formed. During 1963, Peter Mazur, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S., demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around 1 °C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphoxide,</b> but the rate is not a universal optimum.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the study of}} reaction mechanisms by means of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Studies of the nucleophilic bimolecular substitution (SN 2) reaction had the dual purpose of improving our fundamental understanding of molecular reactivity and assessing the ability of kinetic isotope effects to serve as mechanistic tools. The transition state of the SN 2 reaction between a cyanide ion and ethyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran {{was found to be}} reactant like and only slightly tighter than has been found previously for the same reaction in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphoxide.</b> One conclusion was that the transition-state structure in this reaction was predicted fairly well by the theoretical calculations, even without solvent modelling. The SN 2 reactions between cyanide ions and para-substituted benzyl chlorides were found to have reactant-like transition states, of which the Cα-Cl bond was most influenced by the para-substitution. Theoretical calculations indicated that the chlorine KIEs could be used as probes of the substituent effect on the Cα-Cl bond if bond fission was not too advanced in the transition state. Furthermore, the nucleophile carbon 11 C/ 14 C KIEs were determined for the reactions between cyanide ions and various ethyl substrates in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphoxide.</b> Precision conductometry was employed to estimate the aggregation status of tetrabutylammonium cyanide in tetrahydrofuran and in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphoxide,</b> which is of interest as tetrabutylammonium cyanide is frequently used as the nucleophilic reagent in mechanistic investigations and synthetic reactions.
