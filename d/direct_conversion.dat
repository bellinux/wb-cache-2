5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. <b>Direct</b> <b>conversion</b> of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E

This means that energy from aneutronic fusion could be captured using <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> instead of the steam cycle that is used for neutrons. <b>Direct</b> <b>conversion</b> techniques can either be inductive, based on changes in magnetic fields, electrostatic, based on pitting charged particles against an electric field, or photoelectric, in which light energy is captured.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that energy may be extracted from polywells using heat capture or, {{in the case of}} aneutronic fusion like D-3He or p-11B, direct energy conversion, though that scheme faces challenges. The energetic alpha particles (up to a few MeV) generated by the aneutronic fusion reaction would exit the MaGrid through the six axial cusps as cones (spread ion beams). <b>Direct</b> <b>conversion</b> collectors inside the vacuum chamber would convert the alpha particle's kinetic energy to a high-voltage direct current.

40|$|From the {{earliest}} days of power reactor development, <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion</b> was an obvious choice to produce high efficiency electric power generation. Directly capturing the energy of the fission fragments produced during nuclear fission avoids the intermediate conversion to thermal energy and the efficiency limitations of classical thermodynamics. Efficiencies of more than 80 % are possible, independent of operational temperature. <b>Direct</b> energy <b>conversion</b> fission reactors would possess a number of unique characteristics that would make them very attractive for commercial power generation. These reactors would be modular in design with integral power conversion and operate at low pressures and temperatures. They would operate at high efficiency and produce power well suited for long distance transmission. They would feature large safety margins and passively safe design. Ideally suited to production by advanced manufacturing techniques, <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion</b> fission reactors could be produced more economically than conventional reactor designs. The history of <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion</b> can be considered as dating back to 1913 when Moseleyl demonstrated that charged particle emission could be used to buildup a voltage. Soon after the successful operation of a nuclear reactor, E. P. Wigner suggested the use of fission fragments for <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion.</b> Over a decade after Wigner's suggestion, the first theoretical treatment of the conversion of fission fragment kinetic energy into electrical potential appeared in the literature. Over the ten years that followed, a number of researchers investigated various aspects of fission fragment <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion.</b> Experiments were performed that validated the basic physics of the concept, but a variety of technical challenges limited the efficiencies that were achieved. Most research in <b>direct</b> energy <b>conversion</b> ceased in the US by the late 1960 s. Sporadic interest in the concept appears in the literature until this day, but there have been no recent significant programs to develop the technology...|$|R
25|$|Electrostatic <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> uses charged particles’ {{motion to}} create voltage. This voltage drives {{electricity}} in a wire. This becomes electrical power, {{the reverse of}} most phenomena that use a voltage to put a particle in motion. Direct energy conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It {{has been described as}} a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at Lawrence Livermore. He proposed to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage to drive current in a wire. Post helped develop the theoretical underpinnings of <b>direct</b> <b>conversion,</b> which was later demonstrated by Barr and Moir. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981.|$|E
25|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>conversion</b> This is {{a method}} where the kinetic energy of a {{particle}} is converted into voltage. It was first suggested by Richard F. Post in conjunction with magnetic mirrors, in the late sixties. It has also been suggested for Field-Reversed Configurations. The process takes the plasma, expands it, and converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. This method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent.|$|E
25|$|Although {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} {{a small amount of}} carbon, {{historically}} steel and iron-making were intended for different products given the high costs of steel over wrought iron. The main difficulty with making steel is that its higher melting point than pig or cast iron was not easily achievable in large-scale production until methods that introduced air or oxygen to oxidize the carbon in the molten pig iron were developed, allowing the <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> of molten pig iron to molten steel.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>conversions,</b> also {{referred}} to as [...] "straight conversions", are conversions in which the source code of the original game is used with relatively few modifications. <b>Direct</b> <b>conversions</b> were fairly rare until {{the second half of the}} 1990s. In the case of arcade conversions, this was because arcade systems were usually much more advanced than their contemporary home-based systems, which thus could not accurately recreate the speed, graphics, audio, and in some cases even the gameplay algorithms of arcade games. In the case of personal computer conversions, most games pre-1995 were produced in assembly language, and source-based conversions could not be reproduced on systems with other processors, rendering the original source code useless. Also, while most third-party developers had access to the original graphics and audio, they could not be faithfully reproduced on older home computers such as the ZX Spectrum and developers were forced to recreate the graphics and audio from scratch.|$|R

25|$|As with S-parameters, T-parameters {{are complex}} values {{and there is}} a <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> between the two types. Although the {{cascaded}} T-parameters is a simple matrix multiplication of the individual T-parameters, the conversion for each network's S-parameters to the corresponding T-parameters and the conversion of the cascaded T-parameters back to the equivalent cascaded S-parameters, which are usually required, is not trivial. However once the operation is completed, the complex full wave interactions between all ports in both directions will be taken into account. The following equations will provide conversion between S and T parameters for 2-port networks.|$|E
25|$|The second easiest {{reaction}} is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium {{is commonly used}} by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this {{reaction is}} aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion. <b>Direct</b> <b>conversion</b> has achieved a 48% power efficiency against 80–90% theoretical efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|Over 7,548 unique {{characters}} {{participated in}} the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted {{in the loss of}} 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Onlines history, estimating that the battle cost $300,000–$330,000 in real-world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While <b>direct</b> <b>conversion</b> of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for $20 USD, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not mean this amount of real-world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Onlines economy, stated that [...] "To me, as an economist, that doesn’t really matter. In both cases this is economical value that is created by people’s work, either in real life or in virtual life.
