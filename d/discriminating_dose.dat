Unsatisfactory results of insecticide applications {{are caused by}} several factors, {{one of the most}} important being resistance of stored-product insects. The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility in several populations of red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) from Serbia to different contact insecticides. Toxicity of the insecticides dichlorvos, malathion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, pirimiphos-methyl, deltamethrin and bifenthrin to adults of a laboratory population of T. castaneum was investigated in the laboratory by topical application. At the LD₅₀, deltamethrin was the most toxic and malathion the least toxic of the insecticides. <b>Discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> data for the laboratory population were used to test the susceptibility of 10 other populations originating from different storage facilities (silos, warehouses and flour mills) in Serbia. The <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> of malathion caused mortality of up to 85 % in seven populations, indicating malathion resistance in those populations. For two populations of T. castaneum from Nikinci and Jakovo LD values, ld-p lines and levels of susceptibility/resistance (RRs) were determined. The most toxic insecticide for adults from Nikinci and Jakovo was deltamethrin, while malathion was least toxic.

40|$|Phosphine gas, or {{hydrogen}} phosphide (PH[subscript 3]), {{is the most}} common insecticide applied to durable stored products worldwide and is routinely used in the United States for treatment of bulk-stored cereal grains and other durable stored products. Research from the late 1980 s revealed low frequencies of resistance to various residual grain protectant insecticides and to phosphine in grain insect species collected in Oklahoma. The present work, which used the same previously established <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> bioassays for phosphine toxicity as in the earlier study, evaluated adults of nine different populations of red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and five populations of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) collected from different geographic locations in Oklahoma. One additional population for each species was a laboratory susceptible strain. <b>Discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> assays determined eight out of the nine T. castaneum populations, and all five populations of R. dominica, contained phosphine-resistant individuals, and highest resistance frequencies were 94 and 98 %, respectively.

40|$|Common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus) {{is a major}} weed of {{conservation}} tillage systems in Australia. The major problem associated with the weed is that it reduces stored soil moisture in fallow, impacting the subsequent crop. Glyphosate has been a reliable control option for the weed, but resistance to glyphosate has now been confirmed in populations growing in the northern cropping region of Australia. To determine how widespread this problem is in the northern cropping region, a survey commenced in 2014 and will conclude in 2016.

40|$|Laboratory {{test was}} carried out on larvae and adults of the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, to {{determine}} fipronil toxicity. Adult immersion test (AIT, N = 26), larval immersion test (LIT, N = 71) and larval packet test (LPT, N = 41) were standardized using susceptible strain (Mozo). Dose-response curves were compared with a fipronil resistant strain. Four variables were analyzed from AIT results: mortality, weight of eggs on day 7 and on day 14, index of fertility, and index of fecundity. For larval test, dose mortality curves were analyzed. In spite of the high LC(50) variability, all variables determined for AIT were appropriate to discriminate both strains. AIT and LIT had more sensitivity than LPT, with larger resistance factors. It was used two times LC(99. 9) as <b>discriminating</b> <b>doses</b> (DCs) following FAO suggestion. For mortality by AIT, LIT and LPT the DCs were estimated: 4. 98 ppm, 7. 64 ppm and 2365. 8 ppm, respectively, for Mozo strain.

Traditionally, determination of phosphine resistance in stored product beetles {{is based on a}} <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> bioassay that can take up to two weeks to evaluate. We developed a diagnostic cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence method, CAPS, to detect individuals with alleles for strong resistance to phosphine in populations of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, according to a single nucleotide mutation in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) gene. We initially isolated and sequenced the DLD genes from susceptible and strongly resistant populations of both species. The corresponding amino acid sequences were then deduced. A single amino acid mutation in DLD in populations of T. castaneum and R. dominica with strong resistance was identified as P 45 S in T. castaneum and P 49 S in R. dominica, both collected from northern Oklahoma, USA. PCR products containing these mutations were digested by the restriction enzymes MboI and BstNI, which revealed presence or absence, respectively of the resistant (R) allele and allowed inference of genotypes with that allele. Seven populations of T. castaneum from Kansas were subjected to <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> bioassays for the weak and strong resistance phenotypes. Application of CAPS to these seven populations confirmed the R allele was in high frequency in the strongly resistant populations, and was absent or at a lower frequency in populations with weak resistance, which suggests that these populations with a low frequency of the R allele have the potential for selection of the strong resistance phenotype. CAPS markers for strong phosphine resistance will help to detect and confirm resistant beetles and can facilitate resistance management actions against a given pest population...|$|E

We developed a multiplex PCR using allele-specific primers to amplify wild type or mutated genotypes of the three mutations simultaneously. This assay was used to screen tick samples originating from Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Australia whose phenotype to flumethrin and cypermethrin had been determined by the use of the Larval Tarsal test (LTT) or the Larval Packet Test (LPT). These mutations were found to have distinct geographical distributions and result in different resistance phenotypes. The L 64 I Domain II mutation conferring resistance to several SP compounds was found in all the Brazilian, Argentinean and Australian populations and in one South African population, with frequencies between 38 % and 100 % in flumethrin and cypermethrin resistant populations.

The extensive use of insecticides for the control of malaria and other vector species is being carried out for vector management. The insecticide resistance status of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) to DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and deltamethrin was studied in the Sonitpur district of Assam. Even today DDT is the most widely used insecticides for public health programs in India. Recent information on the level of resistance to DDT and deltamethrin in an Aedes mosquito population of North East India is scarce. Continued monitoring of insecticide resistance status and identification of the underlying mechanism of resistance in the Aedes mosquito population is of prime importance. Insecticide susceptibility assays were performed on wild-caught adult female Aedes albopictus mosquitoes to the <b>discriminating</b> <b>doses</b> of DDT (4 %) and deltamethrin (0. 05 %) recommended by the World health organization (WHO). In all study sites, mortality as a result of DDT varied from 40. 2 to 80. 2 % as compared to 94. 2 % in the susceptible laboratory strain (S-lab), indicating that Ae. albopictus is resistant to DDT in all study sites except Gohpur.

40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles funestus {{is a major}} malaria vector in {{southern}} Africa. Vector control relies {{on the use of}} insecticide chemicals to significantly reduce the number of malaria vectors by targeting that portion of the female population that takes blood meals and subsequently rests indoors. It has been suggested that the intake of a blood meal may assist female mosquitoes to tolerate higher doses of insecticide through vigour tolerance. It is hypothesized that during the process of blood digestion, detoxification mechanisms required for the neutralizing of harmful components in the blood meal may also confer an increased ability to tolerate insecticide intoxication through increased enzyme regulation. Methods Bottle bioassays using a range of concentrations of the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin were performed on pyrethroid susceptible and resistant laboratory strains of An. funestus in order to detect differences in insecticide susceptibility following a single blood meal. Based on these results, a discriminating dosage was identified (double the lowest dosage that resulted in 100 % mortality of the susceptible strain). Blood-fed and unfed females drawn from the resistant strain of An. funestus were then assayed against this <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose,</b> and the percentage mortality for each sample was scored and compared. Results In the insecticide dose response assays neither the fully susceptible nor the resistant strain of An. funestus showed any significant difference in insecticide susceptibility following a blood meal, regardless of the stage of blood meal digestion. A significant increase in the level of resistance was however detected in the resistant An. funestus strain following a single blood meal, based on exposure to a <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> of permethrin. Conclusion The fully susceptible An. funestus strain did not show any significant alteration in susceptibility to insecticide following a blood meal suggesting that vigour tolerance through increased body mass (and increased dilution of internalized insecticide) does not {{play a significant role in}} tolerance to insecticide intoxication. The increase in insecticide tolerance in the pyrethroid resistant strain of An. funestus following a blood meal suggests that insecticide detoxification mechanisms involved in insecticide resistance are stimulated by the presence of a blood meal prior to insecticide exposure, leading to enhanced expression of the resistance phenotype. This finding may be significant in terms of the methods used to control indoor resting populations of An. funestus if the mass killing effect of insecticide application proves increasingly inadequate against blood-feeding females already carrying the insecticide resistance phenotype. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the dose-response relationship of increasing doses of oxymetazoline compared with placebo in normal subjects, {{and to determine}} the sensitivities of rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry and symptoms in <b>discriminating</b> between differing <b>doses</b> of oxymetazoline in normal subjects. METHODS: The study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-response design. One hundred and twenty-five healthy volunteers with no nasal obstruction were randomized to administration of a single intra-nasal dose of oxymetazoline (6. 25 microg, 12. 5 microg, 25 microg or 50 microg) or placebo to each nasal cavity. Nasal airway resistance (NAR) was measured by active posterior rhinomanometry. Total minimum cross-sectional area (tMCA) and volume (tVOL) were measured by acoustic rhinometry. Symptoms of congestion (CON) were assessed on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The two highest doses of oxymetazoline produced {{a significant decrease in}} NAR compared with placebo (P = 0. 015) but not between placebo and 12. 5 microg or 6. 25 microg. There was a dose-response relationship for tVOL, which increased significantly after all doses compared with placebo (P < 0. 001) and showed differences between 6. 25 -microg and 25 -microg (P < 0. 014) and 12. 5 -microg and 50 -microg (P < 0. 05) doses. tMCA increased compared with placebo after all treatments (P = 0. 028), but {{there were no significant differences}} between any of the active doses. There were no significant changes in CON after any treatments compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: tVOL shows a clear dose-response relationship for the range of doses of oxymetazoline administered. tVOL provides a sensitive and discriminatory measure of small nasal changes after low doses of oxymetazoline.

Study {{funded by}} Spanish lNIA(RTA 2013 - 00064 -C 02 - 02). Anthelmintic {{resistance}} (AR) in ovine gastrointestinal nematodes (GlN) to benzimidazole (BZs) {{is associated with}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the isotype 1 of B-tubulin, at codon 200 principally, but also at codons 167 and 198. ln this study we compared the levels of AR of GIN field strains by the Egg Hatch Assay (EHA) {{and the percentage of}} BZ resistance alleles obtained after pyrosequencing. Throughout the years 2012 and 2013, variation in resistance was checked by EHA in two sheep flocks (A and B). Resistance was measured by the proportion of eggs hatched at <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 1 g/ml thiabendazole. DNA extraction was carríed out from a pool of larvae and eggs from faecal samples. Prior to pyrosequencing, the fragments including the SNPs 198 / 200 were amplified for Trichostrongylus spp, Ieladorsagra circumcincta and Haemonchus conbrtus, independently for each species; a fragment for the SNP 167 in T. circumcrncfa was also amplified. Flock A had a high level of hatching throughout the study, with a mean of 77. 74 o/o (57. 21 - 90. 64...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of resistance to}} phosphine in the rust-red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, from eastern Australia was investigated, {{as well as the}} potential fitness cost of this type of resistance. <b>Discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> tests on 115 population samples collected from farms from 2006 to 2010 showed that populations containing insects with the weakly resistant phenotype are common in eastern Australia (65. 2 of samples), although the frequency of resistant phenotypes within samples was typically low (median of 2. 3). The population cage approach was used to investigate the possibility that carrying the alleles for weak resistance incurs a fitness cost. Hybridized populations were initiated using a resistant strain and either of two different susceptible strains. There was no evidence of a fitness cost based on the frequency of susceptible phenotypes in hybridized populations that were reared for seven generations without exposure to phosphine. This suggests that resistant alleles will tend to persist in field populations that have undergone selection even if selection pressure is removed. The {{prevalence of}} resistance is a warning that this species has been subject to considerable selection pressure and that effective resistance management practices are needed to address this problem. The resistance prevalence data also provide a basis against which to measure management success...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{commonly}} used acaricides (amitraz, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, and flumethrin) on the eggs of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus collected from Ludhiana, Punjab, was evaluated by egg hatch assay (EHA). The regression graph of probit hatchability and per cent inhibition of hatching (IH%) of eggs was plotted against log values of concentration of various acaricides. All concentrations of flumethrin and amitraz caused complete inhibition of hatching, whereas a hatchability of 31. 0 ± 6. 1, 40. 0 ± 5. 2 and 19. 3 ± 1. 7 % was only recorded {{at the highest}} concentration of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate, respectively. An increase in the concentration of the acaricide showed {{a significant effect on}} the IH% of eggs for cypermethrin P< 0. 01 and deltamethrin P< 0. 05 but was nonsignificant for fenvalerate. The slope of the regression curve of IH% was utilized for the calculation of the dose of various acaricides causing inhibition of hatching for 95 % eggs (LC 95) and the <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> (DD). Results indicated that maximum DD was recorded for fenvalerate (2. 136 %), followed by cypermethrin (0. 214 %) and deltamethrin (0. 118 %). The results of the current study will be helpful in formulating effective control strategies against ticks...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: The alcohol discriminative {{stimulus}} {{has been}} extensively studied in animals and demonstrated to be pharmacologically complex. In contrast, however, the alcohol stimulus has been less frequently studied in humans. Objectives: The aim of the experiments reported here was to characterise pharmacologically an alcohol discriminative stimulus in social drinkers. Methods: Volunteers were first trained to <b>discriminate</b> a <b>dose</b> of 0. 2 g/kg alcohol from placebo, using an established method. We then investigated the generalisation response and subjective effects following a range of doses of the γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) A benzodiazepine-receptor agonist lorazepam (0, 0. 5, 1 and 2 mg, PO). Results: Low doses of lorazepam (0. 5 and 1 mg) did not cross-generalise with the alcohol stimulus and produced only minimal subjective effects. However, a dose of 2 mg lorazepam substituted (60. 8 %) for the stimulus (P< 0. 02) and increased subjective ratings of "lightheaded" (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: These {{results are consistent with}} the pre-clinical literature and indicate the cross-species generality of the GABAA component of the alcohol discriminative stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} the predictive accuracy of an empirically-derived score (weight loss, insulin resistance, and glycemic control: “WIG”) to predict patients {{who will be}} successful in reducing diabetes mellitus (DM) medication use with weight loss. Methods: Case records of 121 overweight and obese patients with DM at two outpatient weight management centers were analyzed. Results: Mean period of follow-up was 12. 5  ±  3. 5 months. To derive the “WIG” scoring algorithm, one point each was assigned to “W” (loss of 5 % of initial body weight within the first 3 months of attempting weight loss), “I” (triglyceride [TGL]/highdensity lipoprotein ratio > 3 [marker of insulin resistance] at baseline), and “G” (glycosylated hemoglobin [A 1 c%] > 8. 5 at baseline). WIG score showed moderate accuracy in <b>discriminating</b> anti-DM <b>dose</b> reductions at baseline, and after 3 months of weight loss efforts (likelihood ratios [LR] + > 1, LR− 0. 7), and demonstrated good reproducibility. Conclusions: WIG score shows promise {{as a tool to}} predict success with dose reductions of antidiabetes medications...|$|R
40|$|Terrorism using {{radiological}} dirty bombs or improvised nuclear devices {{is recognized}} as {{a major threat to}} both public health and national security. In the event of a radiological or nuclear disaster, rapid and accurate biodosimetry of thousands of potentially affected individuals will be essential for effective medical management to occur. Currently, health care providers lack an accurate, high-throughput biodosimetric assay which is suitable for the triage of large numbers of radiation injury victims. Here, we describe the development of a biodosimetric assay based on the analysis of irradiated mice, ex vivo-irradiated human peripheral blood (PB) and humans treated with total body irradiation (TBI). Interestingly, a gene expression profile developed via analysis of murine PB radiation response alone was inaccurate in predicting human radiation injury. In contrast, generation of a gene expression profile which incorporated data from ex vivo irradiated human PB and human TBI patients yielded an 18 -gene radiation classifier which was highly accurate at predicting human radiation status and discriminating medically relevant radiation dose levels in human samples. Although the patient population was relatively small, the accuracy of this classifier in <b>discriminating</b> radiation <b>dose</b> levels in human TBI patients was not substantially confounded by gender, diagnosis or prior exposure to chemotherapy. We have further incorporated gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{mosquito}} Aedes aegypti is {{the principal}} vector of dengue and yellow fever flaviviruses. Temephos is an organophosphate insecticide used globally to suppress Ae. aegypti larval populations but resistance has evolved in many locations. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) controlling temephos survival in Ae. aegypti larvae were mapped {{in a pair of}} F 3 advanced intercross lines arising from temephos resistant parents from Solidaridad, México and temephos susceptible parents from Iquitos, Peru. Two sets of 200 F 3 larvae were exposed to a <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> of temephos and then dead larvae were collected and preserved for DNA isolation every two hours up to 16 hours. Larvae surviving longer than 16 hours were considered resistant. For QTL mapping, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at 23 single copy genes and 26 microsatellite loci of known physical positions in the Ae. aegypti genome. In both reciprocal crosses, Multiple Interval Mapping identified eleven QTL associated with time until death. In the Solidaridad×Iquitos (SLD×Iq) cross twelve were associated with survival but in the reciprocal IqxSLD cross, only six QTL were survival associated. Polymorphisms at acetylcholine esterase (AchE) loci 1 and 2 were not associated with either resistance phenotype suggesting that target site insensitivity is not an organophosphate resistance mechanism in this region of México. Temephos resistance is under the control of many metabolic genes of small effect and dispersed throughout the Ae. aegypti genome...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acaricide failure {{has been}} on the rise in the western and central cattle {{corridor}} of Uganda. In this study, we identified the tick species associated with acaricide failure and determined their susceptibility to various acaricide molecules used for tick control in Uganda. Methods: In this cross sectional study, tick samples were collected and identified to species level from 54 purposively selected farms (from 17 districts) that mostly had a history of acaricide failure. Larval packet test was used to screen 31 tick populations from 30 farms for susceptibility at <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> (DD) and 2 × DD of five panels of commercial acaricide molecules belonging to the following classes; amidine, synthetic pyrethroid (SP), organophosphate (OP) and OP-SP co-formulations (COF). Resistance was assessed based on World Health Organization criteria for screening insecticide resistance. Results: Of the 1357 ticks identified, Rhipicephalus (Rhipicephalus) appendiculatus and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus were the major (95. 6 %) tick species in farms sampled. Resistance against SP was detected in 90. 0 % (27 / 30) of the tick populations tested. Worryingly, 60. 0 % (18 / 30) and 63. 0 % (19 / 30) of the above ticks were super resistant (0 % mortality) against 2 × DD cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. Resistance was also detected against COF (43. 3 %), OP chlorfenvinphos (13. 3 %) and amitraz (12. 9 %). In two years, 74. 1 % (20 / 27) of the farm...|$|E
40|$|Tribenuron-methyl is {{commonly}} used for post emergence control of broad leaf weeds in wheat fields. In order to survey suspicious resistant weeds in wheat fields to this herbicide thirty-eight fields of Kermanshah province were investigated during 2012 - 2013. Seeds of suspected resistance of wild mustard were gathered and tested in a randomized complete blocks design experiment with three replications. First, for early detection of herbicide resistance, the suspected population was screened using <b>discriminating</b> <b>dose</b> of tribenuron-methyl. Determining of the resistance degree was conducted by whole plant bioassay tests using dose-response curves. The resistance mechanisms were assayed by molecular methods, especially using the ALS gene cloning by PJET 1. 2 /blunt Vector. For susceptible populations, the concentration required for complete control was 10. 4 g ai ha- 1 tribenuron-methyl. Also, in screening tests 50 % of populations as resistant populations were identified. According to the Beckie and Tardif, {{it was found that}} 57. 8 % of these population did have a very high degree of resistance, 31. 5 % with high resistance and 10 / 5 % with low resistance degree. GR 50 of the resistant weeds was also increased as compared to sensitive weed, which indicates resistance in this province, Thus to control the resistant populations Z 15, this amount increased to 1309 g ai ha- 1. The results of DNA sequencing showed that mutation by replacing proline amino acid at position Ala 122 causes resistance based on target-site mutation...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} image-guided radiotherapy on the dose distributions in breast boost treatments. Materials and methods: Computed tomography images from a cohort of 60 patients treated within the IMPORT HIGH trial (CRUK/ 06 / 003) were used to create sequential and concomitant boost treatment plans (30 cases each). Two treatment plans were created for each case using tumour bed planning target volume (PTV) margins of 5 mm (achieved with image-guided radiotherapy) and 8 mm (required for bony anatomy verification). Dose data were collected for breast, lung and heart; differences with margin size were tested for statistical significance. Results: A median decrease of 29 cm (range 11 - 193 cm) of breast tissue receiving 95 % of the prescribed dose was observed where image-guided radiotherapy margins were used. Decreases in doses to lungs, contralateral breast and heart were modest, but statistically significant (P 91 %) of the prescribed dose in 12 cases; in addition, the required partial breast median dose was exceeded in nine concomitant boost cases by 0. 5 - 3. 7 Gy. Conclusions: The use of image guidance and, hence, a reduced tumour bed PTV margin, in breast boost radiotherapy resulted in a modest reduction in radiation dose to breast, lung and heart tissues. Reduced margins enabled by image guidance were necessary to <b>discriminate</b> between <b>dose</b> levels to multiple PTVs in the concomitant breast boost plans investigated...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Although well characterised in animals, {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about alcohol discriminative stimulus effects in humans. Objective: The study was carried out to investigate the correspondence of subjective effects and the discriminative response during the acquisition of a low dose alcohol discrimination in humans. Methods: Healthy volunteers completed an Alcohol Use Questionnaire and were then trained to <b>discriminate</b> a <b>dose</b> of 0. 2 g/kg alcohol from placebo using a money reinforced technique. Subjects sampled drinks during training, but also completed rating scales measuring Taste, Like/Dislike and Subjective Effects for each drink. Results: Thirty-two subjects learned the discrimination (discriminators; Ds). In these subjects, differences between placebo scores and alcohol scores for Lightheadedness, Relaxed, Arousal and Fatigue were greater following acquisition of the discrimination, compared with differences at the start of training. Differences in other measures remained consistent. Twenty-six of the volunteers failed to learn the discrimination (non-discriminators; NDs). These subjects reported drinking approximately twice as much alcohol during the preceding 6 months, as the Ds (4. 35 - 0. 53 g/kg per week versus 2. 08 - 0. 19 g/kg per week, respectively, P< 0. 001). There were no alcohol specific differences in ratings for Lightheadedness, Relaxed, Arousal or Fatigue between the Ds and the NDs. However, Dislike scores did differentiate between the Ds and the NDs in that the NDs had reduced ratings for the alcohol drink only compared with the Ds (P< 0. 02). Conclusions: These results support the suggestion from animal studies, that the alcohol stimulus is a compound, and characterise the subjective effects which contribute to a low dose cue in humans. In addition, the data suggest that previous drinking experience may selectively alter aversive responses to alcohol and that this, in addition to differences in general arousal levels, may have affected subjects' ability to learn the discrimination...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSocial insects {{typically}} discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates using colony-specific blends of cuticular hydrocarbons, {{which may}} {{be considered as a}} chemical label. Within a species, the cuticular profile shows approximately the same qualitative set of compounds, although these differ quantitatively among colonies. Thus, the relative proportions of particular hydrocarbons may be higher in individuals of one colony compared to those of another (conspecific) colony. Social insects must perceive these differences in ratios in order to efficiently recognize non-nestmates. However, {{little is known about the}} underlying perceptual mechanisms. Here we investigated whether ants can <b>discriminate</b> between different <b>doses</b> of individual linear or methyl-branched hydrocarbons. We used the ant Camponotus aethiops as our study organism and differential conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response as the experimental procedure, to test olfactory discrimination between two concentrations of the same compound (one rewarded and the other punished), using large (wide range, 1 : 100) and small differences (narrow range, 1 : 10) in hydrocarbon concentrations. Ants discriminated well between wide-range concentrations of the same compound, but showed asymmetric generalization between narrow-range concentrations. These results indicate that a certain differential in hydrocarbon concentration is essential for efficient discrimination...|$|R
