Torresola's sister had been wounded and his brother Elio was arrested.

Truman, {{in order to bring}} world attention to the need for independence in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during a news conference on 15 November 2001. When sculptor Douwe Blumberg saw that image, he felt impressed that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> and created what became the only public sculpture to commemorate special forces, America's Response Monument.|$|E

500|$|The {{author of}} The Sena Story, Vaibhav Purandare, said Raj resorted to this measure to stem his party's eroding credibility. He said, [...] "When Raj {{launched}} his party, he first {{started out with}} an inclusive approach. When he found {{that it is not}} working, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> drastic {{to get back into the}} limelight. On the other hand, the Sena was actually becoming inclusive. It even began attracting Muslims into its fold. It also began taking up the common man's issues like farmer suicides and power supply. This is Raj's attempt to take the Sena's mass base away to completely embarrass the Sena. And he has succeeded." [...] Both Ketkar and Purandare, however, agreed that Raj was trying to position himself as Bal Thackeray's potential successor.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was working too hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so unless I {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically I decided I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It was a wonderful, experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E

[...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs.

500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up {{to the point where we}} were standing erect".|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E
