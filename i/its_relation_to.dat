5|$|Marx {{has been}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} influential figures in human history and his work has been both lauded and criticised.

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and <b>its</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of <b>its</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Kierkegaard's life.|$|E

5|$|TBR1 was {{identified}} in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The gene, initially named TES-56, {{was found to}} be largely expressed in the telencephalic vesicles of the developing forebrain of mice. The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to <b>its</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E

5|$|While {{introduced}} in 2002 {{as a new}} title, the WWE often made allusions to other titles including those of WCW and the NWA, amalgamating {{the history of the}} championship with the history of the belt that represents it. As affirmed by WWE, the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship, but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship, just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Due to <b>its</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> both titles, its lineage is connected with the earliest recognized world heavyweight championship. In 2009, WWE released a DVD set called History of the World Heavyweight Championship that definitively linked the title to the WCW and NWA titles.|$|E
5|$|II. Andantino in F-sharp minor, A–B–A form. The A section {{presents}} a sparse, lamenting, poignant melody, full of sighing gestures (portrayed by descending seconds). This theme, despite its vastly different character, references the opening {{bars of the}} Allegro, an aforementioned source {{of much of the}} sonata's material – the Andantino's first measure shares with the fanfare a second-beat bass note 'echo' after the downbeat on A, creating an audible rhythmic affinity; additionally, the quiet close of the A theme features the fanfare's characteristic pattern of stepwise thirds in the middle voices enclosed between tonic octaves. The middle section is of an improvisatory, fantasia-like character, with extremely harsh modulations and sonorities, culminating in C-sharp minor with fortissimo chords. The chromaticism, triplet emphasis, and modulatory patterns of this section are all reminiscent of the developments nested within the Allegro's exposition. After the C-sharp minor climax (according to Fisk, a key of great importance in the cycle due to <b>its</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Der Wanderer), a recitative section with startling sforzando outbursts emphasizing an ascending minor second leads to a serene phrase in the major mode (C-sharp major), which in turn leads (as the dominant of F-sharp minor) back to the A section, here somewhat transformed, with new accompanimental figuration. The final bars of the movement feature rolled chords that prefigure the opening of the following Scherzo.|$|E
