25|$|Life {{science is}} a <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> with {{extensive}} {{research and development}} activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing diabetes care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish biotech company Novozymes, the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch based bioethanol, has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to cellulosic ethanol. Medicon Valley, spanning the Øresund Region between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe's largest life science clusters, containing {{a large number of}} life science companies and research institutions located within a very small geographical area.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{establishment}} of the National Water Company (NWC) in 2008 there was no separation between institutions in charge of policy and regulation on the one hand, and service provision on the other. Instead all <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> functions were the direct responsibility of a single Ministry, the Ministry of Water and Electricity. The quality and efficiency of service provision are hampered by the many weaknesses afflicting the public sector in Saudi Arabia in general. These include an inadequate civil servants recruitment policy, insufficient salaries, limited skills, no accountability for action taken (or not taken), a lack of strategic planning, and ad-hoc investment decisions.|$|E
25|$|From 2006 to present, the Chinese {{government}} has considered animation as a <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> {{for the birth}} of a new national identity and for the cultural development in China. The {{government has}} started to promote the development of cinema and TV series with the aim of reaching 1% of GDP {{in the next five years}} against an investment of around RMB250-350 million (€29-41 million). It supported the birth of about 6000 animation studios and 1300 universities which provide animation studies. In 2010, 220,000 minutes of animations were produced, making China the world's biggest producer of cartoons on TV.|$|E

We then continue with the identification of <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> according to centrality measures.

Finally, we report the relation between the properties and <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> of European economies to the structure of intra-EU trade.|$|R
40|$|Economic sectors {{which are}} closely related {{to the rest of the}} economy (<b>key</b> <b>sectors)</b> through {{backward}} and forward interindustry linkages may be exploited to induce greater rates of economic growth. Following the Hirschmanian Unbalanced Growth Hypothesis, an economy may grow at a greater rate, if investment resources are concentrated to the <b>key</b> <b>sectors,</b> than if the same resources are distributed differently. <b>Key</b> <b>sectors</b> may be identified by the better than average, interindustry linkage index, measured using the input-output analytic approach. The measured interindustry linkage index of the Malaysian economy shows that <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> are generally concentrated in sectors which undertake manufacturing activities. However, certain sectors in agriculture and services industries also exhibit strong interindustry linkages. As a strategy to hasten the economic growth of the Malaysian economy, these identified <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> may be considered for exploitation by concentrating investment resources to them...|$|R
30|$|The overall {{concern with}} the {{identification}} of <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> is their usefulness in economic development strategy. Since <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> have high backward and forward linkages {{with the rest of}} the economy, investment in these sectors is expected to enhance economic development prospects [6, 7, 14].|$|R
25|$|Major General Walter E. Lauer (20 June 1893 – 13 October 1966) was {{a senior}} United States Army officer who fought in both World War I and World War II. During World War II he {{commanded}} the 99th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Bulge. The green troops of the 99th, along with the battle-tested 2nd Infantry Division, held a <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> controlling access to Spa and Leige and large repositories of ammunition, fuel, and supplies. Despite being outnumbered by German forces at least five to one, during the Battle of Elsenborn Ridge they did not yield. It was the only sector of the American front lines during the German offensive where the Germans failed to advance. Lauer was a veteran of both World War I and II.|$|E

Medicon Valley [...] is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the Øresund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions {{with a focus on}} research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.|$|E
40|$|Since <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> {{have high}} {{backward}} and forward linkages with {{rest of the}} economy, investment in these sectors is expected to maximize the economic growth, which is extensively meaningful in undeveloped or developing countries with limited resources. Besides, it is considerably necessary and helpful to identify <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> for analyzing the long-term structural change and economic development strategic policy, both at national and regional level. However, identification of the <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> is somehow difficult to carry out in practice at regional level due {{to the absence of}} regional data at hand. In this study, we employ the traditional backward and forward linkages as indicators to identify the <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> for sub-national regions, where the input-output (IO) tables are unavailable, along with non-survey techniques. The regional IO tables are produced from adjusting national IO tables with several non-survey techniques. To capture the performance of non-survey techniques on recognizing <b>key</b> <b>sectors,</b> then, the estimated regional backward/forward linkages are computed, which are represented by the output multipliers, and compared with the survey based benchmarks through the rank correlation coefficients. A big value of correlation indicates a high capability of the non-survey techniques on the identification of regional <b>key</b> <b>sectors.</b> At last, empirical study is given with Korean 2005 national and regional IO tables...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine the}} use of multisectoral {{qualitative}} analysis (MSQA) for evaluating the potential of <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> in a regional case. They examine the desirability of policy focusing on the promotion of <b>key</b> <b>sectors.</b> It is suggested that the tools used to identify, and then to justify, <b>key</b> <b>sectors</b> are generally underdeveloped. The authors provide a review of selected methods to identify and classify <b>key</b> growth <b>sectors,</b> and their strengths and weaknesses. Given the weaknesses inherent in these approaches, it is particularly important for policymakers to consider methods which can test and extend key-sector evaluation. The authors suggest that MSQA provides an effective and policy-relevant means of forming conclusions on sector potentials, and report on a pilot exercise undertaken in the Welsh economy. ...|$|R

2500|$|From 24 August onwards, {{the battle}} was a fight between Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 and Park's 11 Group. The Luftwaffe {{concentrated}} all their strength on knocking out Fighter Command and made repeated attacks on the airfields. Of the 33 heavy attacks in the following two weeks, 24 were against airfields. The <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> stations were hit repeatedly: Biggin Hill and Hornchurch four times each; Debden and North Weald twice each. Croydon, Gravesend, Rochford, Hawkinge and Manston were also attacked in strength. Coastal Command's Eastchurch was bombed at least seven times because it {{was believed to be}} a Fighter Command aerodrome. [...] At times these raids caused some damage to the sector stations, threatening the integrity of the Dowding system.|$|E
2500|$|Philippe Pétain, over {{whose head}} Nivelle had been {{promoted}} to become commander-in-chief, wanted to launch a major attack against the Germans near Reims. The proposal is considered to have likely resulted in considerable difficulties for the Germans, but Nivelle refused because Petain's offensive would delay Nivelle's offensive for two weeks. [...] General Micheler, commander of the French Reserve Army Group, which was to exploit the expected breakthrough on the Aisne, had serious misgivings about the upcoming battle. In a letter to Nivelle on 22 March, Micheler argued that the French might not break through as quickly as Nivelle wanted, as the Germans had reserves available, and had strengthened their defenses along a <b>key</b> <b>sector</b> of the Aisne. The other commanders of the French army groups also had concerns, but Nivelle did not make any major adjustments to his plan.|$|E
