5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel {{to feel his}} penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
25|$|However {{there were}} Nestorians in China (Xian and Turfan), Manchuria and Mongolia {{already in the}} 6th century, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{possible}} that they also arrived earlier to the Coromandel coast.|$|E
25|$|A G Noorani {{argues that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{acceptable}} for a Kashmiri {{to contest the}} elections and recognise the Constitution while remaining committed to plebiscite and Independence {{and the reason for}} this is that the Constitution itself leaves the disposition of Kashmir open.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{normal for}} Hong Kong stocks of even {{well-known}} companies to trade at prices {{that correspond to}} less than HK$4 a share. A Hong Kong stock would {{not be considered a}} penny stock unless its price was less than about HK$0.50.|$|E
25|$|It is characterised by the {{introduction}} to the study of foreign languages, uses children from 8–10 years old and is based on comparison between languages, using Esperanto as a reference. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> adapted to children, {{it turns out to be}} extremely effective from the pedagogic point of view.|$|E
25|$|The goddess's {{reputation}} {{as not only}} a protector but a huntress becomes much clearer in fourth-century statuary. Though the two Piraeus Artemises are portrayed in long dresses, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> clear from her bow and quiver {{that she is a}} huntress, while other statues of Artemis depict her in a short or double-belted dress and indicate a more active Artemis.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considered}} a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to {{not participate in the}} fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the Coptic Orthodox Church. If one has responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled because of fasting, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> permissible not to fast.|$|E
25|$|Crystal Beach, in the Village of Crystal Beach, Ontario, at {{the eastern}} end of the lake, is one of many South-facing beaches on the Canadian side. As such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{situated}} for sun-lovers and bathers, facing the sun from sunrise to spectacular sunset. The beach is gently sloping with no sharp drop-offs or rip currents, and is usually cooled by southwest breezes, even on the hottest days.|$|E
25|$|Henri Bergson defined intuition as a simple, {{indivisible}} {{experience of}} sympathy through {{which one is}} moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it. The absolute that is grasped is always perfect {{in the sense that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> what it is, and infinite {{in the sense that it}} can be grasped as a whole through a simple, indivisible act of intuition, yet lends itself to boundless enumeration when analysed.|$|E

25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> good English to use {{the same}} word in two {{different}} senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as {{in the case of the}} Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.|$|E
25|$|The blade may {{not have}} {{imperfections}} in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the knife must be checked before each session. In the past the knife was checked {{through a variety of}} means. Today the common practice is for the shochet to run his fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if he can feel any imperfections. He then uses a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> sharp and smooth. After the slaughter, the shochet must check the knife again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during shechita. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly,</b> logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{their return}} trip to New York, The Sun {{newspaper}} quoted Judd about the rumor of the Hawaiian Islands being for sale: [...] "…there is no truth in it whatsoever. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> absurd." [...] Dismissing {{the issue of}} possible annexation, Judd pinpointed the source as coming from England: [...] "This {{was thought to be}} such a serious matter that the British government sent two men of war to Honolulu." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Bug Nebula", {{also called}} [...] "The Butterfly Nebula", {{is a more}} recent discovery. Known as NGC 6302 {{is one of the}} {{brightest}} and most popular stars in the universe – popular in that its features draw the attention of a lot of researchers. [...] It happens to be located in the Scorpius constellation. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> bipolar, and until recently, the central star was unobservable, clouded by gas, but estimated {{to be one of the}} hottest in the galaxy – 200,000 degrees Fahrenheit, perhaps 35 times hotter than our Sun.|$|E
500|$|Although assault {{involves}} {{a threat of}} an immediate battery, the perpetrator need not actually intend to carry out that battery. It is enough that he, intentionally or recklessly, caused the victim to apprehend such an occurrence. The term [...] "immediate" [...] has also been used in different ways. Following Ireland, {{it seems likely that}} even where the victim knew the defendant was some distance away, this may be sufficient. As Lord Steyn said there, [...] "what, if not the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about?". This would widen the crime of assault considerably. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> conceivable that the victim was fearful, but did not believe an attack was imminent. That she actually apprehended [...] "immediate violence", rather than merely [...] "immediately apprehended", is doubtful. In Constanza, it was sufficient for the prosecution to show that the victim feared an attack in the future, which may have been imminent. It also suggested that the anticipated harm could be psychological rather than physical.|$|E

500|$|Variations {{of these}} analogies {{are used for}} {{rotating}} mechanical systems, such as in electric motors. [...] In the impedance analogy, instead of force, torque is made analogous to voltage. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> possible that both versions of the analogy are needed in, say, a system that includes rotating and reciprocating parts, in which case a force-torque analogy is required within the mechanical domain and a force-torque-voltage analogy to the electrical domain. [...] Another variation is required for acoustical systems; here pressure and voltage are made analogous (impedance analogy). [...] In the impedance analogy, {{the ratio of the}} power conjugate variables is always a quantity analogous to electrical impedance. [...] For instance force/velocity is mechanical impedance. [...] The mobility analogy does not preserve this analogy between impedances across domains, but it does have another advantage over the impedance analogy. [...] In the mobility analogy the topology of networks is preserved, a mechanical network diagram has the same topology as its analogous electrical network diagram.|$|E
500|$|Cara Kelly of The Washington Post {{gave the}} show a mixed review; {{although}} it was [...] "revolutionary" [...] after Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, it was a [...] "pathetic attempt at a comeback". According to Lou Harry of the Indianapolis Business Journal, Madonna lacked focus and energy and the audience response was lukewarm. Harry called the show an [...] "awkward celebration", but praised its overall production. USA Todays Elyssa Gardner wrote, [...] "Madonna herself, stylish but hardly provocative in tailored tops and skirts that showed off her yoga-toned gams, delivered [...] and other flourishes with a winking sense of humor". David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called the show [...] "Madonna's zombie halftime", criticizing its song choices and overall concept: [...] " [...] acting as if she's almost singing. I say almost, because {{there is not a}} whit of artistic aspiration in the star performer or the production as far I can tell. But hey, that's our sad-sack, super-sized, gross American culture these days, isn't it. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> suited for empty Super Bowl half-time spectacle".|$|E
500|$|... ere we have John Wayne, {{who was a}} major {{artistic and}} {{psychological}} figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... {{a certain sense of}} honor [...] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E
