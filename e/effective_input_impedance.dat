40|$|Properly {{terminating}} differential amplifiers for {{single-ended input}} applications can be challenging. This application note simplifies {{the process by}} walking through the calculations from start to finish. The {{first step is to}} determine the input impedance of the amplifier. CALCULATING THE INPUT IMPEDANCE The <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of a circuit depends on whether the amplifier is being driven by a single-ended or differential signal source. For balanced differential input signals, as shown in Figure 1, the input impedance (R IN, dm) between the inputs (+DIN and −DIN) is simply RIN, dm = 2 × R...|$|E

40|$|Voltage biased, {{frequency}} multiplexed TES bolometers {{have become}} a widespread tool in mm-wave astrophysics. However, parasitic impedance and dynamic range issues can limit stability, performance, and multiplexing factors. Here, we present novel methods of overcoming these challenges, achieved through digital feedback, implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In the first method, known as Digital Active Nulling (DAN), the current sensor (e. g. SQUID) is nulled in a separate digital feedback loop for each bolometer frequency. This nulling removes the dynamic range limitation on the current sensor, increases its linearity, and reduces its <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance.</b> Additionally, DAN removes constraints on wiring lengths and maximum multiplexing frequency. DAN has been fully implemented and tested. Integration for current experiments, including the South Pole Telescope, will be discussed.

30|$|EFD {{serves the}} bias current control {{capability}} for the WPT system, {{which can be}} set within ±  300  nA in 256 steps (resolution: 2.34  nA) through the bias register (100 MΩ), from the bias feedback amplifier driven by the ±  99  V power supply (MV 99  V). In the initial operation from March 2017, ~  19 nA was constantly fed as the bias current to all probes. By the bootstrapping of this feedback loop through EFD’s bias amplifier with a gain of ~  0.99, the <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of WPT-Pre (DC) can exceed 1 GΩ. Such high impedance is sufficiently larger than the plasma resistance to ambient plasma and enables us to appropriately measure the space plasma potential. The bias current circuit is also used for two calibration signals: (1) The bias current sweep mode, in which the bias current is changed within ±  300  nA during 0.5  s, in order to evaluate the antenna resistance measurement through the evaluation of Langmuir curve as the relation between bias current and probe potential. (2) The voltage calibration mode, in which the bias circuit serves the fixed voltage to the WPT-Pre input through the calibration register (1 MΩ), within the dynamic range of ±  30  V in 256 steps under the disconnection of the loop-back route in the bias amplifier in EWO-EFD. In both cases, the amount of bias current (or calibration signals) can be set separately for the U 1 /V 1 and U 2 /V 2 pairs. (U 1 /V 1 cannot set different values and U 2 /V 2 is same. This restriction {{is caused by the}} restrictions of the design from that of MMO PWI/EWO-EFD; MMO PWI has only one WPT-S pair).|$|E
40|$|The {{muscle fibre}} {{electrical}} properties, miniature excitatory junctional current (m. e. j. c.) and miniature excitatory junctional potential (m. e. j. p.) were studied during growth of an identified crayfish muscle fibre from {{a diameter of}} 20 to 400 microns. The specific membrane resistance (Rm), and the specific internal resistance (Ri), of the muscle fibre were independent of fibre diameter (d) during growth. The current-voltage relation has a similar shape in large and small fibres, indicating that voltage dependence of Rm does not change during growth. The input resistance (R 0) was approximately proportional to d- 1. 5, as predicted theoretically. The specific membrane capacitance (Cm) and the membrane time constant (Tm) increased linearly with fibre diameter, apparently {{as a result of}} the contribution of the tubular capacitance to Cm. The decrease in R 0 and the increase in Tm should have resulted in a 90 -fold decrease in m. e. j. p. amplitude during growth of the fibre from a diameter of 20 to 240 microns. However, m. e. j. p. amplitude was found to decrease only 21 -fold. This discrepancy was shown to result from an increase in m. e. j. c. amplitude and duration during growth. There was 2. 9 -fold increase in m. e. j. c. amplitude and a 2. 7 -fold increase in m. e. j. c. duration over the range of muscle fibre growth studied. This increase in the m. e. j. c. apparently results from an increase in the magnitude and duration of the synaptic conductance change produced by a quantum of transmitter. Throughout the range of muscle fibre diameters studied, the muscle fibre <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> for the m. e. j. c. was 17 - 19 % of R 0.
