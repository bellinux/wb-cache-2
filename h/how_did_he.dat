LeMond responded: [...] "Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer and {{directed}} by Gene Stupnitsky. It originally aired April 9, 2009, {{the same day as}} the episode [...] "Dream Team"; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes. [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] was the fourth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] According to the Season 5 DVD episode commentary, B. J. Novak came up with the story idea involving Jim and the [...] "run-down" [...] and worked it into Spitzer's final script. The episode included a new title sequence with footage of the series characters in the new Michael Scott Paper Company office setting, rather than the Dunder Mifflin setting from the previous episodes. Rainn Wilson and Ed Helms practiced the guitar competition in Ed Helms' trailer during lunch the day of the filming; Helms, a proficient bluegrass banjo player, coached Wilson, who is proficient at guitar and drums. Wilson said he proposed doing a full studio cover of the song, with Creed Bratton providing backup guitar and vocals, and selling it on iTunes for charity. Helms said he was happy {{to have the opportunity to}} play banjo on screen, but did not feel the instrument made much sense for his character; Helms said, [...] "It's so fun and weird, but he's a Connecticut preppy guy. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> pick up a banjo? It's one of Andy's many mysteries, not all of which I even understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} to Georgescu during {{the final stage of}} the critic's career, Manea retold one of his confessions from the time: [...] "I suppose what you heard about me is that I am a Stalinist. I'm not a Stalinist, Mr. Norman, know that. I was with Leiba Trotsky." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Porfirio Díaz was enticed by {{the lure}} of power. His indigenismo only lasted until he took the presidential seat {{the second time around}} in 1884. What changed? What made Díaz go from the victor against a reelectionist {{government}} to the very embodiment of it? His early military career proved his loyalty to his people—the Mixtecs. Prior to his presidency, Díaz provided education and military training for the Indians, which indicated that he did not view them as an obstacle. During his four-year hiatus from the presidency (1880-1884), he was the governor of his native Oaxaca and there, too, he succeeded in implementing public services, with a focus on the Indians. Díaz’s rise to power is undoubtedly impressive and it is not surprising why many, then and now, still consider him the hero of Mexico—the one who brought Mexico out of its backwardness and into the world stage. But why did Díaz, or <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he,</b> become his own antithesis? ...|$|E
2500|$|Although, at {{the time}} when Călinescu's work was first published, Aderca was already marginalized, he made a point of {{replying}} to the allegations. Sebastian, who read a version of this rebuttal during one of his visits to Aderca's home, admired the effort: [...] " [...] very nice, very accurate—but <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> find the strength, the inclination, the curiosity to write it? A sign of youthful vitality. [...] Why do I not feel personally 'aimed at' in what is said, done, or written against me?" [...] Writing in 2009, literary historian Alexandru George took Călinescu's side against Aderca: the allegation of antisemitism was [...] "very unconvincing", and the rebuttal came just as Călinescu was being incriminated for philosemitism by the far-right Gândirea magazine. Others also note that the very mention of Aderca's name in Călinescu's work was valid proof of Călinescu dissidence. Aderca's own replies, leading up to the 1945 article Rondul de noapte, became topics of scandal, and, according to Călinescu's disciple Alexandru Piru, came as a [...] "curious", [...] "violent outburst".|$|E

2500|$|As a discipline, {{art history}} is {{distinguished}} from art criticism, which {{is concerned with}} establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or [...] "philosophy of art", which {{is concerned with the}} fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> come up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
