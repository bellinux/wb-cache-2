5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage <b>in</b> <b>Danger,</b> its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage <b>in</b> <b>Danger</b> and the World Heritage List.
