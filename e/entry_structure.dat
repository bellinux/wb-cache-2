50|$|The glass entry archway, 88-feet (27-m) tall, was {{originally}} designedto {{be the end}} of a glass atrium, but the atrium concept was considered too hot for Houston's summertime weather and a danger in hurricanes, and hence the atrium was omitted during construction. There had been debate about how to re-design the entry section as a non-atrium structure, but the decision was to leave the connecting archway, as designed, and simply enclose with glass. Hence, structurally, the archway could easily be extended, in the future, if some <b>entry</b> <b>structure</b> were to be considered for addition.|$|E

Sections at road and rail crossings had reinforcing steel. Siphon crossings of rivers were made as reinforced round concrete tubes. The interior dimensions of the aqueduct were selected so that no internal pressure {{was developed by the}} water flow; nineteen different interior sections were required. For inspection and maintenance, manholes were provided at approximately 1 mile intervals, which allow insertion of a small boat for inspections.

40|$|Shigella flexneri causes bacillary {{dysentery}} in humans by invading epithelial {{cells of the}} colon. Cell invasion occurs via bacterium-directed phagocytosis, a process requiring polymerization of actin {{at the site of}} bacterial entry. We show that invasion of HeLa cells by S. flexneri induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, a host cell protein previously identified as a cytoskeleton-associated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) substrate for the proto-oncoprotein pp 60 c-src. Immunolocalization experiments indicate that cortactin is recruited to submembranous actin filaments formed during bacterial entry. In particular, cortactin is highly enriched in membrane ruffles of the <b>entry</b> <b>structure,</b> which engulf entering bacteria, and also in the periphery of the phagosome early after bacterial internalization. The proto-oncoprotein pp 60 c-src appears to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, since overexpression of this PTK in HeLa cells specifically increases the level of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation induced during bacterial entry. Immunolocalization studies in pp 60 c-src-overexpressing HeLa cells indicate that pp 60 c-src is recruited to the <b>entry</b> <b>structure</b> and to the periphery of the phagosome, where pp 60 c-src appears to accumulate in association with the membrane. Our results suggest that epithelial cell invasion by S. flexneri involves recruitment and kinase activation of pp 60 c-src. Signalling by the proto-oncoprotein pp 60 c-src {{may play a role in}} cytoskeletal changes that facilitate S. flexneri uptake into epithelial cells, since transient overexpression of pp 60 c-src in HeLa cells can provoke membrane ruffling and appears also to stimulate bacterial uptake of a non-invasive S. flexneri strain...|$|E

The entry thus contains a mixture of explicit and implicit information interspersed with codes for type-setting and formatting. However, in a computational model of the entry, the lexical information must be extracted from the rest, interpreted and represented explicitly.

40|$|We examine market {{structure}} and optimal commodity taxation {{in a world}} in which firms produce differentiated products and can exert some degree of market power. Building on Kay and Keen (1983), we model two forms of product technologies, two forms of market <b>entry</b> <b>structures,</b> and two forms of pricing. This yields eight models providing a richer analysis of the role of taxes as regulatory tools than could be provided in Kay and Keen's analysis. In the presence of price discrimination, tax policy loses much of its effectiveness at serving as a substitute for direct regulation. Moreover, in cases where taxes can influence {{market structure}}, subsides rather than taxes may be required to achieve optimum market structure. Our results should remove the presumption that has developed over the past twenty years that the ad valorem tax rate should be positive to discourage excess entry in imperfectly competitive markets. ...|$|R

40|$|General-purpose bilingual {{dictionaries}} contain {{very little}} extra- -linguistic, civilizational, information. Consequently, {{they are quite}} inadequate aids for fully comprehending the civilizational content of a foreign-language text. Regular encyclopedias are also often surprisingly inadequate for the purpose, as illustrated by this paper on specific examples from American society. This argues for a special reference worik: a Dictionary of American Society and Civilization (DASC). Scope of dictionary is then discussed and a comparative-culture approach stressed. Lexicographic issues, such as entry selection and presentation, are dealt with in some detail. Intra-entry lexicographic techniques are given special prominence. A three-block <b>entry</b> <b>structure</b> is suggested as most suitable for a DASC, {{made up of a}} factual-information block, a cultural-context block, and a block of comparative- -culture comment.

40|$|I. Abstract This {{paper is}} based on the {{theoretical}} principes of the Polish ethnolinguistic works introduced {{in the first part of}} this paper. We pay special attention to the theory of anthropocentrism of a natural language. The main focus of this theory is the differentiation between "one's own" and "human" on one side and "someone else's" and "non-human"on the other in a cognitive comprehension of the world. We further apply the anthropocentric approach to outline the conceptualization of domestic animals in the Czech language. The second part of the text deals with the expression pes (‚dog') in Czech and its derivatives, their position within the lexical system, their semantics, connotations and the stereotypes associated with them. The conclusion presents a cognitive definition of the concept pes (‚dog') in Czech. The definition builds upon the <b>entry</b> <b>structure</b> of the Polish Dictionary of Folk Stereotypes and Symbols...|$|E

Energy and capital {{are assumed to be}} complementary in the production process. New machines are less energy con- suming and scrapping is endogenous.

In particular, under a free <b>entry</b> <b>structure</b> for the energy sector, invest- ment subsidies boost investment, while the opposite result emerges under natural monopoly if increasing returns in the energy sector are not strong enough.
