25|$|There are {{alternatives}} to a block heater that offer {{some of the}} same benefits. These include heaters attached to the engine's oil pan, usually with magnets. Dipstick heaters can be installed in place of the engine's oil dipstick. Heated blankets are available for the entire <b>engine</b> <b>area,</b> as well. A timer can be used with any of these heaters, so that it {{does not have to be}} left on all the time. This can help lower the electrical costs of using a block heater.|$|E
25|$|Directly {{behind the}} cockpit and {{underneath}} the main rotor was the rotorcraft's engine and its nylon bag-type fuel tank, which was housed within a welded tubular steel framework attached to the cockpit structure and to the tailboom. Power was directed to the tail rotor via a torque shaft contained within the tail cone, which featured gearing so that pilots could readily adjust the speed and direction of tail rotor movement. The engine was provided with cooling air via an intake on {{the centre of the}} starboard side of the rotorcraft; for improved ventilation, the cowling around the <b>engine</b> <b>area</b> could be entirely removed. The de Havilland Gipsy Major that was used to power the majority of Skeeters was credited with being a major contributor to the rotorcraft's relatively high fuel efficiency due to its use of fuel injectors (the high aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe itself was another beneficial factor).|$|E

2500|$|For the 1983 models {{not much}} was altered, {{but there was}} an {{increase}} in power output to [...] and [...] of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the <b>engine</b> <b>area</b> was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It featured an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the [...] "power" [...] driving mode or [...] "normal" [...] driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the <b>engine</b> <b>area</b> to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated ignition shielding covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|E

5000|$|In 1937, Canadian Car and Foundry had {{obtained}} {{rights to a}} training aircraft designed by Leland Stamford Wallace known as the [...] "Wallace Trainer." [...] The nearly-complete project was a conventional biplane with two open cockpits, powered by a Kinner B-5 engine. Featuring welded steel-tube fuselage, ailerons and tail with a wing structure utilizing spruce spars and ribs, the entire aircraft was fabric covered, except for aluminium panelled cockpit and <b>engine</b> <b>areas.</b> Canadian Car and Foundry renamed the project the Maple Leaf I.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{a simple}} steel tube {{structure}} in {{the nose of the}} fuselage was used to support the engine; detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the <b>engine's</b> <b>areas</b> for inspection or adjustment purposes. Installed underneath the fuselage, the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft; this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level. An atypical feature for the era was the use of tungum pipes throughout the cooling system.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2001 the Nordic Empress {{suffered}} extensive {{engine room}} fire damage while sailing 140 {{miles north of}} Bermuda. Subsequent investigation revealed {{the cause of the}} fire was failure of a loose bolt in a fuel line flange assembly that had been improperly repaired. The broken bolt caused the flange assembly to separate, allowing fuel to leak around the engine. Moments after a low fuel pressure alarm sounded in the engine room, the leaking fuel ignited against the hot engine surfaces, causing a large explosion that was visible on the engine room CCTV. The engines were stopped immediately and all fuel pumps switched off. Crew members attempting to enter the <b>engine</b> <b>area</b> to fight to fire with fire hoses were forced to turn back from the intense heat. 6 minutes into the fire, the engine room overhead fire sprinkler system was activated along with the ship's general emergency alarm. The sprinklers appeared to have extinguished the fire after 4 minutes, and crew once again attempted to re-enter the <b>engine</b> <b>area,</b> only to have the residual fuel in the <b>engine</b> <b>area</b> ignite a flash fire that was quickly extinguished with fire hoses. During the subsequent inspection of the engine room and surrounding areas, burning wires were discovered in an adjacent compartment. The space was evacuated before lowering watertight doors and releasing 885 kg of halon and restarting the overhead sprinkler system. 3 hours after the first fire broke out, the incident was logged as resolved. The ship was able to return to Bermuda under reduced power, and was subsequently taken out of service for 2 weeks for repairs. Total expenses and lost revenue related to the fire totaled over $8.8 million.|$|E

50|$|In 1951 he {{was hired}} {{to set up a}} new turbine {{division}} at Lycoming's otherwise unused plant in Stratford, Connecticut. Here he decided to focus on <b>engine</b> <b>areas</b> not currently served by the larger companies (General Electric and Pratt & Whitney), eventually settling on helicopter engines. His first design, the T53, would go on {{to be one of the}} most popular turboshaft engines in history, powering the Bell Aircraft UH-1 Huey and AH-1 Cobra helicopters, and the OV-1 Mohawk ground attack aircraft. He followed this success with the larger T55, later converting it into a small turbofan engine as well. In the 1960s he led development of a new design for tank use, which developed into the AGT-1500, used on the M1 Abrams.|$|R

50|$|A stronger, tougher tile {{which came}} into use in 1996. TUFI tiles came in high {{temperature}} black versions {{for use in}} the orbiter's underside, and lower temperature white versions for use on the upper body. While more impact resistant than other tiles, white versions conducted more heat which limited their use to the orbiter's upper body flap and main <b>engine</b> <b>area.</b> Black versions had sufficient heat insulation for the orbiter underside but had greater weight. These factors restricted their use to specific areas.|$|E
50|$|The factory {{attached}} the body's doors, windshield, hood, and trunk lid before shipping the kit to the buyer.
