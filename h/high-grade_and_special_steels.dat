40|$|Basic ferroalloys {{are some}} of the most {{important}} ingredients for producing carbon <b>and</b> <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> (using ferrochrome <b>and</b> other <b>special</b> ferroalloys). The market of basic ferroalloys is somehow independent of other raw materials markets, depending mostly of steel. There are sometimes speculative operations, but they do not have a significant impact on prices. Producers are concentrated in countries and regions where metals (manganese, silicium or silicon, chromium) deposits can be found: mostly Africa, China and Latin America. On the other side, consumption is concentrated in Europe and the USA, recently also within the BRIC countries. This situation generates conflicts, especially about prices and long term contracts. The spot market is quite volatile and dominated by traders. The atypical crisis which began at the end of 2007 had not a significant impact on basic ferroalloys prices until 2012. By contrast, 2013 was a very difficult year for ferroalloys, with small prices and a precarious economic situation worldwide...|$|R

The structural health monitoring system will be designed to monitor the performance and detect damage in a <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> moment resisting frame <b>and</b> <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> concentrically braced frame under lateral seismic loading. To aid in the design and implementation of the structural health monitoring system, pushover analyses were conducted to assess likely locations of damage. From the pushover analyses, a set of damage cases were created for each frame that were used in a theoretically confirm the Modal Strain Energy damage detection algorithm. The modal strain energy method is a vibration-based method of structural health monitoring that utilizes operational modal analysis and the time domain decomposition technique. For each damage case, computer modal analysis was used to obtain theoretical mode shape data of the structure. In each damage case, the modal strain energy method algorithm was appeared to correctly identify in the story level of the lateral force resisting frame that contained the damage.

40|$|While {{manufacturing}} different {{grades of}} steel in an alloy <b>and</b> <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> plant, it is practically impossible to allocate {{the cost of}} major operational materials such as refractories, electrodes and nipples, ingot moulds etc. to each grade of steel. Conventionally, cost allocation of operational materials is done based on the time taken for processing a particular grade of steel. A more accurate picture of the utilization levels of these operational materials by different grades of steel can be obtained if one factors in {{the differences in the}} rate of consumption, in view of the variations in temperature and intensity of chemical reactions. Earlier quadratic model with a non-linear objective function and linear constraints has been envisaged to estimate the consumption pattern for each grade manufactured, so that a realistic grade-wise cost can be arrived at. In this paper, use of Excel Solver has been demonstrated based on the quadratic model envisaged earlier. The same has been validated with results obtained using examples, which the managers {{will be able to use}} for obtaining the results immediately for scaled-up scenarios...|$|R

50|$|In certain alloy steels, {{martensite}} {{can also}} be formed by the working and hence deformation of the steel at temperature, while it is in its austenitic form, by quenching to below Ms and then working by plastic deformations to reductions of cross section area between 20% to 40% of the original. The process produces dislocation densities up to 1013/cm2. The great number of dislocations, combined with precipitates that originate and pin the dislocations in place, produces a very hard steel. This property is frequently used in toughened ceramics like yttria-stabilized zirconia <b>and</b> in <b>special</b> <b>steels</b> like TRIP steels. Thus, martensite can be thermally induced or stress induced.|$|R
