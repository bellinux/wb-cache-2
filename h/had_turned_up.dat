5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|After the Test, Loxton bowled first {{change in}} the first innings against Middlesex. He took 3/33 from 21 overs as the hosts were bowled out for 203. Loxton removed Leslie Compton, his younger brother and England Test batsman Denis, and Jim Sims {{in the space of}} five runs to reduce Middlesex from 5/182 to 8/188. He had a heavier {{workload}} than normal in the first innings, as leading paceman Lindwall <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> inebriated on the first morning and therefore lacked energy and penetration. Loxton then joined Morris at the crease, with Australia in difficulty at 3/53. They put on 172 in 115 minutes before Morris was out for 109, and Loxton followed him at 5/271 for the top-score of 123, having punished the bowlers in a hard-hitting display. Australia then collapsed to be all out for 317. Loxton took 1/15 in the second innings to help seal victory by ten wickets in Australia's only county match before the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 people that had made a dash for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> to protest against Griffin.|$|E

Agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the Midwest Bank Robbers investigation.

The infographics from RIA Novosti shows that the Sakharov Avenue can provide room for a maximum of 96,000 people at a density of 35 people per 10 sq m, or for 55,000 people at a smaller and more realistic density distribution.|$|E

25|$|The 2000–01 {{season was}} Redknapp's final year. They {{got off to}} a dismal start, {{hampered}} by further injuries (Sinclair notably, but also Ian Pearce continued absence), a number of failed loan transfers (Christian Bassila and Kaba Diawara) and unimpressive signings (Davor Šuker, reportedly on £50,000-a -week wages who only managed eight starts, Ragnvald Soma and the continued absence of Margas, who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> for half of the previous season). With the team in the doldrums, the board eventually accepted a bid for the team's prized asset – Rio Ferdinand – in an £18million move to Leeds United for both the British transfer record and a world record for a defender. The deal was later criticised – the fee was not paid upfront and sell-on bonus was not included, meaning the club missed out on his later £30million move to Manchester United and also a sizeable chunk of the initial transfer.|$|E
500|$|Limited to {{a further}} two starts and two {{substitute}} appearances, on 28 December the club confirmed that Roberts was {{under investigation for}} what it described as a [...] "serious breach of club discipline".

500|$|McGovern has {{traveled}} {{several times to}} Colombia to meet with human rights advocates, and has been very critical of Plan Colombia and US military aid to that country. On March 25, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an unsigned editorial suggesting that McGovern supported the Marxist FARC rebels in Colombia. According to the Journal, {{an investigation of the}} computer hard drive of the recently killed Raúl Reyes, second-in-command of the FARC, <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> material indicating [...] "an ardent effort" [...] on the part of McGovern [...] "to do business directly with the FARC." [...] The article said that McGovern had been [...] "working with an American go-between, who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia's elected and popular government." [...] In response to these charges, McGovern said that his concern was to help win the release of hostages held by the FARC, as requested by several families of Americans held by the FARC. He said that he had no sympathy for the rebels or for their hostage-taking.|$|E
500|$|James Radley, {{owner of}} Liverpool's {{landmark}} Adelphi Hotel, had laid on a banquet for 7.00pm to celebrate [...] "the success {{and promotion of}} steam power". He had prepared food for 230, and sold 60 advance tickets. By 9.00pm, {{with most of the}} passengers still on the train back from Manchester including Liverpool trade magnate William Brown who was to chair the meeting, only 20 people <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up.</b> Businessman and politician John Ashton Yates was drafted in to replace Brown, and the 20 diners began a subdued two-hour meal, frequently interrupted by riders bringing the latest news from Eccles. During the main course messages were brought that an operation had been performed successfully and that Huskisson was recovering; by dessert another messenger brought the message that no operation had been performed after all, and that Huskisson was worsening. By the time the meal concluded at around 11.00pm, no reliable news of Huskisson's condition had arrived. Following a toast to the King and to Huskisson's recovery, steamship pioneer Francis B. Ogden, at the time the American Consul in Liverpool, gave a speech about the planned Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and of forthcoming schemes to connect New Orleans with the Great Lakes by rail. Although they did not know it, by this time Huskisson was already dead.|$|E
500|$|Ward's {{trial began}} at the Old Bailey on 28 July. He was charged with living off the {{earnings}} of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 {{to have sex with}} other persons. [...] The thrust of the prosecution's case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time. In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones portrayed Ward as representing [...] "the very depths of lechery and depravity". The judge, Sir Archie Marshall, was equally hostile, drawing particular {{attention to the fact that}} none of Ward's supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him. Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon's conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon's witnesses <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon's trial.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{the results}} were announced, Odinga bitterly accused Kibaki of electoral fraud. Odinga's {{allegations}} scored with his supporters, and seemed meritorious since the results had defied pre-election polls and expectations and election day exit polls. Furthermore, Odinga, who had campaigned against the concentration of political {{power in the hands}} of Kikuyu politicians, had won the votes of most of the other Kenyan tribes and regions, with Kibaki's victory being attained only with the near exclusive support of the populous Kikuyu, Meru and Embu communities-who <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> to vote for Kibaki in large numbers after feeling, in reaction to the Odinga campaign, and with the covert encouragement of the Kibaki campaign, increasingly besieged and threatened by the pro-Odinga tribes. Moreover, ODM had won the most parliamentary and local authority seats by a wide margin. A joint statement by the British Foreign Office and Department for International Development cited [...] "real concerns" [...] over irregularities, while international observers refused to declare the election free and fair. The European Union chief observer, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, cited one constituency where his monitors saw official results for Kibaki that were 25,000 votes lower than the figure subsequently announced by the Electoral Commission, leading him to doubt the accuracy of the announced results.|$|E
