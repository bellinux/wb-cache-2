5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. Some can <b>go</b> <b>without</b> air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} <b>go</b> <b>without</b> royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to <b>go</b> <b>without</b> water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E

5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to <b>go</b> <b>without</b> him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club {{away from being}} relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial constraints {{on the part of}} the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to <b>go</b> <b>without</b> his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing.|$|E
5|$|Placzek became {{head of the}} {{theoretical}} physics division. Kowarski was designated {{to be the head}} of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not <b>go</b> <b>without</b> Kowarski, but Sir Edward Appleton, the permanent secretary of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for James Chadwick. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist Jules Guéron, who had been working for Free France at Cambridge, and Bruno Pontecorvo, an Italian scientist who had worked with Enrico Fermi in Italy before the war.|$|E

50|$|After {{watching}} the {{movie of the}} same name starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, the pair decided to <b>go</b> 50 hours <b>without</b> the use of one of their 5 senses. For the weekend of 6 & 7 February 2010, Andy <b>went</b> <b>without</b> his sight and Hamish <b>went</b> <b>without</b> his hearing. This was achieved through the use of eye patches and dark glasses for Andy and specially moulded earplugs for Hamish.|$|R
5|$|She {{then had}} the idea to weave some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to <b>go</b> <b>without</b> the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E
5|$|TGS head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{assigned}} to solve a public relations problem caused by the show's stars, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), during their hosting duties of the St. Patrick's Day parade, in which Jenna passed out and Tracy cursed during the live television broadcast. To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to <b>go</b> <b>without</b> direction—until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff {{have gotten out of}} hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and <b>go</b> <b>without</b> her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should <b>go</b> <b>without</b> Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{universal}} health care or health insurance coverage. Without health insurance, patients {{are more likely to}} postpone medical care, <b>go</b> <b>without</b> needed medical care, <b>go</b> <b>without</b> prescription medicines, and be denied access to care. Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites. This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the NHS.|$|E
