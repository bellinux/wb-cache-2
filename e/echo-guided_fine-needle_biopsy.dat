40|$|In {{the period}} 1985 - 1988, 62 focal liver lesions in 58 cirrhotic {{patients}} were studied by ultrasonography; 12 of these focal lesions were documented to be regenerating lesions by <b>echo-guided</b> <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> During an average follow-up period of 10. 2 months (range 3 - 22 months), hepatocellular carcinoma was subsequently found in 10 {{of the cases}} of regenerating nodules, whereas the initial diagnosis of regenerating nodule was confirmed in the remaining two cases. Based upon this finding, {{it is suggested that}} every focal mass visualized by ultrasonography in a cirrhotic liver should either be considered to be a neoplastic lesion or at least a preneoplastic lesion if the possibility of either a metastatic or benign lesion (eg, hemangiomas, focal fatty liver change areas) can be excluded. Therefore either fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of all ultrasonographically revealed mass lesions within a cirrhotic liver is advised, such that early appropriate treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma can be instituted...|$|E

40|$|Background. {{the use of}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) -guided biopsies facilitate the diagnosis and management in several medical settings. in this study, the authors analyzed how effective cutting and <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are in pediatric oncology. Methods: Medical records of 75 patients were analyzed in retrospect allowing the study of 101 biopsy results. {{the results of these}} procedures were compared with clinical follow-up or surgical biopsy results and evaluated for how they affected the patient's treatment. Results: CT-guided biopsies altered the treatment in 57 of 75 patients. No major complication occurred. Cutting and <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are comparable in obtaining adequate material, but cutting needle obtains a superior rate of specific diagnosis. Conclusions: CT-guided biopsies are safe procedures that can alter the management of pediatric oncology patients.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration liver <b>biopsy</b> in the documentation of hepatic iron overload has been assessed in iron-loaded rats. Fineneedle aspiration and standard liver biopsy specimens {{were obtained from}} three groups of animals supplemented with oral and parenteral iron for 2 to 6 mo. The mean dry weights of standard and <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens were 7. 41 ± 0. 77 (± S. E. M.) and 0. 57 ± 0. 54 mg, respectively. Hepatic iron in <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> specimens correlated significantly with hepatic iron in standard liver biopsy specimens as measured by biochemical determination, computerized image analysis and histological grading (r > 0. 9, p < 0. 001). In conclusion, we have shown that <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> of the liver can obtain sufficient tissue for biochemical measurement of the hepatic iron concentration in an animal model of iron overload.

40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} rare, but many thyroidectomies {{continue}} to be performed simply to exclude a diagnosis of malignancy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the potential financial savings associated with the use of proton magnetic resonance analysis of follicular neoplasms. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on tissue obtained at the time of surgery from 98 consecutive solitary or dominant thyroid nodules. <b>Fine-needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> were also performed on operative specimens, and the tissues assessed by proton magnetic resonance; these spectra were then compared with those obtained from tissue specimens. An estimate of potential savings was obtained by comparing the magnetic resonance data with the indications for surgery and pathology on all patients having thyroidectomy over a 10 -year period. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was able to distinguish between normal thyroid tissue and invasive thyroid cancer with 100 % specificity. Benign follicular adenomas fall into two groups: 44 % having a spectral pattern comparable with normal thyroid, and the remaining 56 % demonstrating an altered spectral pattern more comparable to the malignant magnetic resonance profile. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy on <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens produced spectra similar to those from tissues from the same patient. From a <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimen, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can identify a group of benign follicular adenomas with spectral profiles akin to those of normal thyroid cells, thus avoiding the need for unnecessary surgical excision.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to review two {{techniques}} that can be used to verify focal lesions in the breasts: <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> and core-needle biopsy. Material and methods: Fifty-five articles (original papers and reviews), half of them published within the past 5 years, were included in the analysis. The authors also took their own experience into account. Results: Pre-operative assessment of focal lesions in the breasts is crucial in the planning of further therapeutic management. The role of <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> has been reduced lately due to its low sensitivity and specificity as well as a high rate of non-diagnostic, suspicious and false negative results. This method does not enable one to differentiate between in situ and invasive disease. Currently, <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is recommended for cystic lesions, suspected of being recurrences in the chest wall, and lymph node metastases. Core-needle biopsy is the basic diagnostic method of breast lesions. According to the recommendations of the Polish Ultrasound Society and American College of Radiology, BIRADS 4 and 5 lesions should be evaluated histopathologically. Core-needle biopsy makes it possible to establish a final diagnosis more frequently than <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> both in the case of benign and malignant lesions. It delivers more information about the nature of a tumor (mutation of HER- 2, estrogen and progesterone receptors and Ki- 67 index). Its limitations include: underestimation of invasion and failure to recognize the components of ductal carcinoma in situ in papillary and atypical lesions. Single <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> is inexpensive, but when considering the cost of further diagnosis due to non-diagnostic, suspicious and atypical results, this method generates high additional costs. Conclusions: Microscopic verification of focal breast lesions is crucial for further therapeutic decisions.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of flow cytometry, as an alternative for immunohistochemistry, for the detection of viral antigens in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Hepatocytes were obtained from regular- and <b>fine-needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> from HBV positive (n= 17) and negative (n= 7) patients and quantified by flow cytometry for intracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). Number of HBsAg positive hepatocytes ranged from 0 to 83 %. A significant correlation was found between the percentage of infected hepatocytes and the intracellular expression level of HBsAg (R= 0. 841, p < 0. 001). The specificity and sensitivity of flow cytometry was similar to immunohistochemistry. Of the patients on anti-viral treatment with undetectable serum HBV DNA (< 400 copies/ml), two had high HBsAg expression in the liver.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} fine and cutting needles in computed tomography guided-biopsy of lung lesions suspicious for malignancy and to determine which technique is the best option for a specific diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the data from 362 (71. 6 %) patients who underwent <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> and from 97 (19. 7 %) patients who underwent cutting-needle biopsy between January 2006 and December 2011. The data concerning demographic and lesion characteristics, procedures, biopsy sample adequacy, specific diagnoses, and complications were collected. The success and complication rates of both biopsy techniques were calculated. RESULTS: Cutting-needle biopsy yielded significantly higher percentages of adequate biopsy samples and specific diagnoses than did <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> (p< 0. 05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of cutting-needle biopsy were 93. 8 %, 97. 3 %, and 95. 2 %, respectively; those of <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> were 82. 6 %, 81. 3 %, and 81. 8 %, respectively (all p< 0. 05). The incidence of pneumothorax was higher for <b>fine-needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy,</b> and that of hematoma was higher for cutting-needle biopsy (both p< 0. 05).
