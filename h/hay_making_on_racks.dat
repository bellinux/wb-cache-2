40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effects of cultivation and <b>hay</b> <b>making</b> factors <b>on</b> chemical composition, protein fractionation, and digestibility in rice straw, as well as to identify the chemical fractions that contribute to the variation in its nutritional value for ruminants. Statistical procedures were performed in a model that included rice crop cycle, sowing season, baling season, soil classification, fertilizer application, and productivity (kg/ha) as fixed effects and the hay bale as random effect. Chemical composition, protein fractionation, and digestibility data were subjected to multivariate analyses including factor, cluster, and discriminant. Considering the cultivation and haymaking factors, development cycle, baling season, and grain production explained the most variation in the rice straw nutritional value. Straws derived from early maturing cultivars showed the lowest levels of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen, and C nitrogen fraction in comparison with straw originating from mid cycle cultivars. Rice straw from more productive cultivars had lower levels of lignin and C fraction as well as higher levels of crude protein and B 3 fraction compared with straws from less productive cultivars. However, the main variation in the nutritional value between the samples of rice straw was related to the baling season. The bailing seasons were grouped in two clusters. Straws with better nutritional value were those with lower levels of cell wall fractions, from more productive crops, with early development cycle and baled until March. Rice crop cycle, baling season, and grain production effects explain the variation in the nutritional value of rice straws. Straws with better nutritional value have lower levels of fractions related to secondary cell wall and lignification...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} Rumex obtusifolius, {{even with the}} use of herbicides, is {{difficult}} in permanent grasslands where R. obtusifolius reduces both productivity and nutritive value of herbage. It is important to find alternative approaches to managing R. obtusifolius. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare the impact of different cutting frequencies, which simulated grazing (three cuts), silage making (two cuts) and <b>hay</b> <b>making</b> (one cut) <b>on</b> shoot and root measurements of the vigour of R. obtusifolius. In both experiments the same cutting frequencies were imposed but in Experiment 1 the treatments were imposed for 2 years and in Experiment 2 for 1 year. Compared to the silage-making and hay-making treatments, there was a reduction in the vigour of the aerial parts of R. obtusifolius on the grazing treatment, associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} leaves (Experiment 1), in the size of the largest leaf (Experiment 1) and in the herbage mass of dry matter (Experiments 1 and 2). Roots had higher concentrations of total soluble sugar and lower concentrations of starch in the grazing treatment than in the other treatments. These results showed that a reduction in the vigour of R. obtusifolius in permanent grasslands is possible only if the plants are submitted to a high frequency of defoliation under cutting or grazing.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine personal PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 1 exposure levels of tractor and combine harvester operators in rotary tilling, disc-harrowing, soil packing, planting, fertilizing, harvesting, <b>hay</b> <b>making,</b> and bale making, and to determine health status of the operators. The gravimetric method was used to determine particulate matters (PM) concentrations. PM 10 concentrations were higher than the threshold limit value (15000 µg m- 3) determined by Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) in rotary tilling (25770 µg m- 3), wheat harvesting (29300 µg m- 3), and <b>hay</b> <b>making</b> (24640 µg m- 3). Similarly, PM 2. 5 concentrations were also greater than the threshold limit (5000 µg m- 3) in these operations (respectively with 5888, 10560, 8470 µg m- 3). PM 1 concentration was considerably high, especially in wheat harvest and <b>hay</b> <b>making</b> (respectively with 3130 and 6026 µg m- 3), and was even greater than the PM 2. 5 threshold limit during <b>hay</b> <b>making.</b> It is probable for such high PM concentrations of fine particles to increase the respiratory system nuisances. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured to be lower than the thresholds in all other field applications. A respiratory questionnaire survey was administered to 40 operators for determination of upper and lowers respiratory disturbances and smoking habits.
