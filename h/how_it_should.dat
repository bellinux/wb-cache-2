5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, {{that the act of}} self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E

Later on, he authored more works relating to education, including the Work and Progress Record Book (Arnold) and The Schools of England (Ed. J. Burrow). He was also {{a contributor to the}} Argosy and other London periodicals, including the English Illustrated Magazine, Longmans and the Boy's Own Paper.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendants}} did {{not appeal}} to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the time for filing such an appeal lapsed on March 22, 1976. After Judge Gignoux's decision became final, the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot gained federal recognition in 1976, thus becoming eligible for $5 million/year in housing, education, health care, and other social services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further, the Interior Department's Solicitors Office began looking into whether and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> proceed in United States v. Maine.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of R.palmatus {{have made it}} difficult for taxonomists to agree on <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be classified, resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive synonymy. First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926. The familial placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously to the families Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae. More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped determine that Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.|$|E
5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be administered. The scheme {{may be used to}} appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E

5|$|Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a {{nationwide}} investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield {{carried out the}} fieldwork in Yorkshire. The {{relationship between the two}} bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council. In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary, and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, reformed the Manchester branch, and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales. The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and Marion Phillips was appointed to succeed her.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When {{the urgency of the}} situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E

25|$|Intramuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue {{has been used}} in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as hypertonic saline is that IMES can be turned on and off.

The method is easier to carry out than the injection method as it does not require special training in <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be used.
