25|$|In the {{laboratory}} setting, {{several members of}} the genus cause severe disease in mice and hamsters. Systemic spread of the virus occurs, with pathological effects present in multiple organs and systems, including the brain, liver, lymphatic system, and sometimes the lungs and small intestine. Lymphocytes are a major target cell for DHOV. DHOV infection in mice resembles experimental influenza infection in mice and ferrets as well as fatal <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> infection of humans, and has been proposed as a model for this disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} infections {{of humans}} by H5N1 coincided with an epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) of <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> in Hong Kong's poultry population in 1997. This panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially {{over a wide}} area) outbreak was stopped by {{the killing of the}} entire domestic poultry population within the territory. However, the disease has continued to spread; outbreaks were reported in Asia again in 2003. On December 21, 2009 the WHO announced a total of 447 cases which resulted in the deaths of 263.|$|E

25|$|After Fouchier {{offered an}} article {{describing}} this {{work to the}} leading academic journal Science, the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) recommended against publication of the full details of the study, and the one submitted to Nature by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin describing related work. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers. However, then the Dutch government declared {{that this type of}} manuscripts required Fouchier to apply for an export permit in the light of EU directive 428/2009 on dual use goods. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied (under formal protest) with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal Science devoted to H5N1. The papers by Fouchier and Kawaoka conclude that it is entirely possible that a natural chain of mutations could lead to an H5N1 virus acquiring the capability of airborne transmission between mammals, and that a <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> pandemic would not be impossible.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 October 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services {{awarded a}} $62.5million {{contract}} to Chiron Corporation to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine {{designed to protect}} against the <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> virus strain. [...] This followed a previous awarded $100million contract to sanofi pasteur, the vaccines business of the sanofi-aventis Group, for avian flu vaccine.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (zanamivir), {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of zanamivir, celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|... "Contemporary human H3N2 {{influenza}} viruses are now endemic in pigs {{in southern}} China and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this intermediate host.""H5N1 virus is now endemic in poultry in Asia (Table 2-1) and has gained an entrenched ecological niche {{from which to}} present a long-term pandemic threat to humans. At present, these viruses are poorly transmitted from poultry to humans, {{and there is no}} conclusive evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, continued, extensive exposure of the human population to H5N1 viruses increases the likelihood that the viruses will acquire the necessary characteristics for efficient human-to-human transmission through genetic mutation or reassortment with a prevailing human influenza A virus. Furthermore, contemporary human H3N2 influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China (Peiris et al., 2001) and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this 'intermediate host.' Therefore, it is imperative that outbreaks of H5N1 disease in poultry in Asia are rapidly and sustainably controlled. The seasonality of the disease in poultry, together with the control measures already implemented, are likely to reduce temporarily the frequency of <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> outbreaks and the probability of human infection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many viruses {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to resist interferon activity. [...] They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting {{the functions of}} proteins that are induced by IFN. [...] Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [...] (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. [...] Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via [...] STAT1, STAT2, [...] or IRF9 [...] (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). [...] Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. [...] Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism reovirus adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. [...] Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV [...] Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. [...] The <b>H5N1</b> <b>influenza</b> virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear.|$|E
