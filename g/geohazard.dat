40|$|Abstract: <b>Geohazards</b> {{caused by}} rising {{groundwater}} {{can have a}} considerable effect on the built environment, especially where this is underlain by former coal mines, such as those found in County Durham, UK. Reactivation of faults and the expulsion of gas are two specific <b>geohazards</b> that are known to occur and be potentially dangerous and threatening to human health. However, little substantive research has been undertaken into these problems to date. This paper will present research undertaken recently to understand the various potential <b>geohazards</b> that can be activated directly by rising groundwater associated with cessation of pumping from deep mine systems. The <b>geohazards</b> considered include landslides, ground subsidence, seismicity, gas emission, impacts on structures, salinisation and health hazards, and these will be examined {{in the context of}} the Durham Coalfield. Numerical modelling has allowed a detailed examination of the effect of rising groundwater on a variety of <b>geohazards,</b> and the results from this study will be presented in this paper.

50|$|A <b>geohazard</b> is a {{geological}} {{state that}} may lead to widespread damage or risk. Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface landslide) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., tsunamis).|$|E

50|$|The {{epicenter}} of the earthquake was too far offshore {{for it to be}} well covered by onshore seismographs and the event's characteristics are therefore poorly constrained. The focal mechanism indicated reverse faulting. The focal depth of between 14 - 31 km show that it occurred within the seismogenic zone, rather than on any of the many shallow growth faults in the area. The earthquake led to a reassessment of the <b>geohazard</b> for hydrocarbon exploration and production facilities in the Gulf.|$|E

50|$|Naturally on Earth gas {{hydrates}} can {{be found}} on the seabed, in ocean sediments, in deep lake sediments (e.g. Lake Baikal), as well as in the permafrost regions. The amount of methane potentially trapped in natural methane hydrate deposits may be significant (1015 to 1017 cubic metres), which makes them of major interest as a potential energy resource. Catastrophic release of methane from the decomposition of such deposits may lead to a global climate change, because CH4 is more of an efficient greenhouse gas than CO2 (see Atmospheric methane). The fast decomposition of such deposits is considered a <b>geohazard,</b> due to its potential to trigger landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis. However, natural gas hydrates do not contain only methane but also other hydrocarbon gases, as well as H2S and CO2. Air hydrates are frequently observed in polar ice samples.|$|E
50|$|Geohazards are {{associated}} with geological activity, geotechnical features and environmental conditions. Shallow geohazards are those occurring at less than 400 m below the seafloor. Information on the potential risks associated with these phenomena is acquired through studies of the geomorphology, geological setting and tectonic framework {{in the area of}} interest, as well as with geophysical and geotechnical surveys of the seafloor. Examples of potential threats include tsunamis, landslides, active faults, mud diapirs {{and the nature of the}} soil layering (presence of karst, gas hydrates, carbonates). In cold regions, gouging ice features are a threat to subsea installations, such as pipelines. The risks associated with a particular type of <b>geohazard</b> is a function of how exposed the structure is to the event, how severe this event is and how often it occurs (for episodic events). Any threat has to be monitored, and mitigated for or removed.|$|E

The production research well project was developed in the Mallik region after methane hydrate was recovered there by a research project in 1998, led by the Geological Survey of Canada and the former Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JNOC), with participation by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the United States Department of Energy (DOE) as well as other industry partners. The project included working efforts of more than 200 scientists and engineers worldwide. Up to today numerous papers have been published to document the results and additional datasets, and provide information on in-situ physical and geophysical properties of gas hydrates, gas hydrate production testing, and the relevance of gas hydrates to energy, climate and <b>geohazard</b> research. Its main outcome was the characterization of gas hydrates found in the Northwest Territories and planning of additional field and laboratory studies. The aim was to determine the future potential for methane as an important factor of the future world energy consumption, additional energy policy and to assess the production and properties of the gas hydrate and its stability. The program was further developed to find out if the increased use of burning methane could contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale, impacting future climate change if released into the environment. Furthermore, the scientific study aimed to develop new safety techniques guarding against any hazardous conditions created by gas hydrate drilling and pipeline construction and give insights into drilling and production technology with regard to a new industrial development.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{exposure}} to natural hazards {{in combination with}} limited preparedness and risk reduction leads to a rapidly growing number of major disasters and loss of property and human lives. The concept of the risk management cycle with the four phases of mitigation and preparedness, early warning, response, and recovery captures the steps necessary {{to reduce the number}} and scale of disasters. In many regions, <b>geohazards</b> dominate the spectrum of natural hazards. Understanding the associated processes and gaining a comprehensive knowledge of the location and characteristics of these hazards is pivotal for informed risk management. Over the past few years, initial steps have been taken by members of the former Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership (IGOS-P) <b>Geohazards</b> Theme to make progress towards a <b>Geohazards</b> Community of Practice (GHCP) for the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). A recommendation of the 3 rd International Workshop on <b>Geohazards</b> held in 2007 led to the establishment of the Supersite Initiative, which has the goal to ensure for a small number of supersites access to comprehensive data for research related to <b>geohazards.</b> This initiative has established a web page where relevant data are available for a number of globally distributed sites. The GHCP has developed a draft roadmap, which lies the ground for utilizing the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) in support of all phases of the risk management cycle.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{increasing}} use of full-coverage sonic mapping of the seafloor has made us {{more aware of the}} large and different number of seafloor processes and events bearing significant <b>geohazard</b> potential. This awareness combines with the increasing use of the seafloor for infrastructure and with the high density of population and settlement on the coast. Seafloor mapping {{is the first step in}} making a census of the geohazard-bearing features present in a given offshore area. It often provides the only tool for a comprehensive, although non-specific, seafloor <b>geohazard</b> assessment over large areas that are scarcely groundtruthed by acoustic prospection and seafloor sampling. However, the characterization of <b>geohazard</b> features on a morphological basis alone is limited, and more detailed investigations are needed to define the character and state of activity of potentially hazardous features. Such investigations include the use of deep-tow or autonomous platforms designed to acquire high-resolution data at depth as well as in situ measurements, both being very expensive activities not applicable over large areas. Thus seafloor mapping is often not only the first and the main but also the only tool for a comprehensive seafloor <b>geohazard</b> assessment. This special issue represents an example of the diversity of approaches to seafloor <b>geohazard</b> assessment and summarizes the present state of this discipline. Both the diverse technologies applied and the specific aims of offshore <b>geohazard</b> assessment brought different communities to deal with the study of seafloor processes and events from remarkably distinct viewpoints. We identified three end members in offshore <b>geohazard</b> assessment: (1) <b>geohazard</b> assessment "sensu stricto", (2) "engineering" <b>geohazard</b> assessment, (3) "non-specific" <b>geohazard</b> assessment. These are being conducted by industry, academia and public agencies in charge of civil protection and land-use planning and management. Understanding the needs and <b>geohazard</b> perception of the different groups is a necessary step for a profitable collaboration in such an interesting and rapidly developing field of marine geology. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.
