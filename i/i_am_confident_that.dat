500|$|Pakistani {{reactions}} to the US apology were different. [...] "We appreciate Secretary Clinton's statement, and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region," [...] Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement. In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. [...] "Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. What were the demands?" [...] said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. And Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: [...] "They did not apologize. They said ‘sorry.’" [...] Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. [...] "The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, {{and we will not}} sit silently over this," [...] retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. [...] "We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies." [...] Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes. Transporters who resume supplies will be [...] "considered a friend of the U.S." [...] and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. [...] "The losses, {{despite the fact that they}} have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring" [...] the correspondent said. According to his analysis it would cause a problem if [...] "the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas" [...] connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.|$|E

2500|$|... Makin's most {{important}} piece of writing, was published in 1673, {{and is in the}} vein of other 17th-century tracts on education. The motivation behind Makin's didactic and polemical essay {{lies in the fact that}} Makin argues for [...] "learning as an aid to the moral life, to women's usefulness and moral agency" [...] (Myers 1985:177). An Essay is grounded in religious thought, for Makin points out that an education lends to the polishing of one's soul so [...] "that you may glorify God." [...] (Makin 1673). [...] Such an education would, according to Makin, cultivate a woman's soul so that women may be better able [...] "to know God, Jesus Christ, themselves, and the things of nature, arts and tongues" [...] (Makin 1673). Makin takes the stance that education will not only benefit the soul of woman, leading her to greater communion with God, but female learning will benefit the nation. She states that [...] "Were women thus educated now, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> advantage would be very great: the women would have honor and pleasure, their relations profit, and the whole nation advantage” (Makin 1673).|$|E

[...] "After thoroughly studying the case, {{it became clear to}} me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today," [...] Holder said. [...] "As the president has said, those unwise and unwarranted restrictions (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security.
