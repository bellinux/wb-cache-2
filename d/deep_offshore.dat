25|$|The yellowspotted trevally, yellowspotted kingfish, goldspotted trevally, or tarrum, Carangoides fulvoguttatus, is a {{widespread}} species of large inshore marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The yellowspotted trevally inhabits the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Australia in the east. The species is known to grow to a maximum length of at least 1.2 m, and is distinguished by gill raker and fin morphology, as well as the distinctive golden spots which give the fish its name. The yellowspotted trevally generally prefers inshore rocky and coral reefs, but is occasionally found over <b>deep</b> <b>offshore</b> sand banks to a depth of 100 m. It is a predatory fish, taking fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, and shows diet partitioning with other trevallies in studies conducted in Australian waters. Reproduction is poorly studied, although observational evidence suggests spawning occurs in aggregations, probably during summer in South Africa. It is generally of minor importance to commercial fisheries throughout its range, but is considered an excellent sportfish by anglers and spearfishermen, and a good table fish.|$|E
25|$|The bludger, Carangoides gymnostethus (also {{known as}} the bludger {{trevally}}, nakedbreast trevally and Bleeker’s jackfish), is a widespread species of large marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The bludger inhabits the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-west Pacific Ocean, distributed from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and New Caledonia in the east. It is a large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 90cm, and is very similar to the yellowspotted trevally, Carangoides fulvoguttatus, but can be separated by the complete absence of breast scales {{and a number of other}} anatomical features. The species inhabits moderately <b>deep</b> <b>offshore</b> coral and rocky reefs, where it preys on small crustaceans and fish. The reproductive biology of the species is poorly known, but it appears to move to more tropical waters to spawn. The bludger is of intermediate importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken by hook and line and various netting methods. It is of some value to anglers also, considered a good gamefish, but generally regarded as poor eating due to its soft oily flesh, which is used as bait by many anglers. The name ‘bludger’ is said to either refer to the blunt head of the species, or the destination of the fish when caught by professional fishermen who treat the fish as discard.|$|E

500|$|The prickly shark {{is a slow}} swimmer and {{has been}} {{observed}} hovering just above the sea floor. A tracking study in Monterey Canyon found that this species exhibits strong diel migration patterns. The sharks were inactive during the day, resting in discrete refuge areas located near the sea floor in <b>deep,</b> <b>offshore</b> waters. They became active at dusk, swimming towards the coast {{to the head of}} the canyon and rising into the water column; this upward movement is likely related to feeding on schooling fishes.

500|$|The sand devil or Atlantic {{angel shark}} (Squatina dumeril) is {{a species of}} angelshark, family Squatinidae, native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.

This bottom-dwelling shark is found in shallow inshore waters in summer and fall, and <b>deep</b> <b>offshore</b> waters in winter and spring. The sand devil's flattened body and enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins give it a ray-like appearance. There is a band of enlarged thorns running along the middle of its back. It is gray or brown in color, with scattered small dark spots. This species reaches [...] in length.|$|E

2500|$|Figaro is a genus of catshark, {{and part}} of the family Scyliorhinidae. Until 2008, Figaro was {{generally}} considered to be a subgenus of Galeus (sawtail catsharks). The two known species are found off Australia, inhabiting <b>deep,</b> <b>offshore</b> waters on or near the bottom. Figaro contains small, slender, firm-bodied sharks that bear distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny dermal denticles along the dorsal and ventral edges of their short caudal fins. The caudal peduncle is relatively long, such as that the anal and caudal fins are some distance apart. In adult males, the inner margins of the pelvic fins are fused together to form a subtle [...] "apron" [...] over the claspers. F. boardmani is a predator of fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods, and is oviparous; less is known about the F. striatus. Both are harmless and are of no economic importance.|$|E

50|$|Presence of seal may be {{an issue}} in some areas due to erosional channels.

50|$|Popular water {{activities}} at Kealoha include swimming, snorkeling, surfing, pole fishing and spearfishing.
