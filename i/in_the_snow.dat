5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain.

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, {{in which he}} helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Snow</b> Maiden, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators.

5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> and filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or {{a pair of scissors}} {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow.</b> At a regular Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is unavailable. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, {{and the rest of the}} friend group shuns him. His flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.|$|E

Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> being lowered down the walls {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E

5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
