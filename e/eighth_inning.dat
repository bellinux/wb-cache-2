5|$|On September 22, Young had {{a no-hitter}} through 8⅓ innings {{of the game}} against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This {{would have been the}} first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the <b>eighth</b> <b>inning</b> and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.|$|E

Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the <b>eighth</b> <b>inning,</b> however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky's Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead.
