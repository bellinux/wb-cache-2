50|$|The coaster, {{along with}} other {{historic}} rides at Playland like the Derby Racer (1927), is a contributing component to the site's National Historic Landmark status. A marker {{on the wall of}} the loading station lists the ride as one of the original attractions at Playland. The ride is still being manually braked, a feat few coasters can claim today. The ride ran using the original <b>flanged</b> <b>wheel</b> trains until the early 1980s, when the lack of rare parts forced management to switch them out with Morgan Manufacturing trains. These trains are also in use on the two Giant Dipper roller coasters in California, (San Diego and Santa Cruz respectively) the only other roller coasters designed by Church still in operation.|$|E
50|$|Dixon {{built it}} on the {{principle}} familiar to him from Tyneside, with timber cross-sleepers and timber rails, and wagons with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> were pulled by horses.|$|R
5000|$|Aveling and Porter built a few geared {{locomotives}} which were, essentially, traction engines with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels.</b> The early ones used {{sprocket chain}} drive but later versions had spur gears.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{design with}} the flange {{on the outside}} designed to be additionally used with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> was unsuccessfully trialled on the Monmouthshire Canal Company's line shortly before reconstruction as a modern railway.|$|R
50|$|Because a stiff wheel {{rolling on}} a rigid rail {{requires}} far less energy per ton-mile moved than road transport (with a highly compliant wheel on an uneven surface), railroads are highly {{suitable for the}} movement of dense, bulk goods such as coal and other minerals. This was an incentive to experiment with many configurations and shapes of wheels and rails. In the late 1760s, the Coalbrookdale Company began to fix plates of cast iron to the upper surface of the wooden rails. These (and earlier railways) had flanged wheels as on modern railways, but another system was introduced, in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal plates - these became known as plateways. John Curr, a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail, though the exact date of this is disputed. The plate rail was taken up by Benjamin Outram for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his Butterley ironworks. Meanwhile, William Jessop, a civil engineer, had used a form of edge rail successfully for an extension to the Charnwood Forest Canal at Nanpantan, Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. Jessop became {{a partner in the}} Butterley Company in 1790. The <b>flanged</b> <b>wheel</b> eventually proved its superiority due to its performance on curves, and the composite iron/wood rail was replaced by an all-metal rail, with its vastly superior stiffness, durability, and safety.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} effects that wear originates on the wheel-rail system is represented by the significant changes introduced in contact area features and contact pressure distribution. In fact, in most cases, even regular operation gradually modifies the profile of the contacting elements so as to transform the original Hertzian counterformal conditions into a conformal contact characterized by lower average pressures and relevant alterations in {{the size and shape of}} the contact patch. On the basis of the aforementioned considerations, this study presents the results of a series of experimental tests carried out with an ultrasonic non-invasive technique, with the final purpose of assessing to what extent wear induces modifications in contact parameters. To this end, in a regular <b>flanged</b> <b>wheel,</b> increasing degrees of wear were artificially produced at the centre of the tread. The interface of the wheel-rail systems thus obtained was investigated with high-frequency ultrasonic waves and the observed coefficient of reflection (which is known to be related to contact conditions) was graphically processed to build contact maps from which to extract information about the size and shape of the contact area and pressure distribution. The results allowed the monitoring of the transition from counterformal to conformal contact, and helped to establish an empirical relationship between the amount of wear and both the contact area value and average pressure. Moreover, contact pressure distribution (obtained with a dedicate calibration procedure) showed that conformal contacts lose the original 'one-peak' pressure trend and exhibit a multi-peak configuration. Thus, the ultrasonic method confirmed its capabilities to faithfully monitor contact conditions even in the case of randomly altered geometries of the contacting elements and, in the specific case, may represent an effective tool in validating the wear simulation models...|$|E
50|$|Church {{developed}} a rolling stock with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> for negotiating steep curves. Prior and Church coaster trains typically consisted of ten or eleven single-bench cars with open-air fronts, each bench securing {{up to three}} riders with a leather strap lap restraint.|$|R
50|$|A {{railroad}} crane has <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> {{for use on}} railroads. The simplest form is a crane {{mounted on}} a flatcar. More capable devices are purpose-built. Different types of crane are used for maintenance work, recovery operations and freight loading in goods yards and scrap handling facilities.|$|R
5000|$|... "Railway" [...] means {{a system}} of {{transport}} employing parallel rails which provide support and guidance for vehicles carried on <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels,</b> and form a track which either is of a gauge of at least 350 millimetres or crosses a carriageway (whether or not on the same level).|$|R
25|$|A {{year later}} George Stephenson, another of Wylam's employees, {{improved}} on that design with Blücher, {{which was the}} first locomotive to use <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> to keep the locomotive on the track, and had cylinder rods directly connected to the wheels in the manner of Catch me who can.|$|R
50|$|Two-rail {{configurations}} {{of this type}} avoid the need for switches and crossings, since the cars have the <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> on opposite sides and will automatically follow different tracks, and in general, significantly reduce costs (especially when the funicular runs in a tunnel, such as the Funicular de Bulnes, in Asturias).|$|R
50|$|Comet has two Junior PTC trains of four {{cars and}} {{utilizes}} <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels.</b> Each car has two seats holding two riders for {{a maximum of}} 16 riders per train. Although the park owns two trains, for several years only one was placed into daily operation as park management was not comfortable running two trains with manually operated skid brakes.|$|R
50|$|Aveling & Porter built {{several small}} {{shunting}} / tram locos {{based on their}} traction engines. They were basically traction engines with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> and no steering. Their advantages were that they were cheap to manufacture (and to design in the first place) {{and they could be}} operated with minimal training by someone who was familiar with traction engines.|$|R
50|$|The Juggernaut is {{a diesel}} railway lorry {{made out of}} bits, bobs and <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels,</b> which appears {{towards the end of}} the series.

2500|$|A former Hants and Dorset {{standard}} LH (NEL847M of 1973) {{was fitted}} with additional <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> in 1980 {{to allow it}} to operate on railway lines. It was owned by the North East London Polytechnic of Dagenham and some work was done by Lucas Aerospace. It was tested on the West Somerset Railway between [...] and [...] in August 1980.|$|R
50|$|Adhesion {{problems}} and steep gradients of 1 in 30 and 1 in 27 {{led to an}} experimental conversion of short stretches to a wooden tramway, and it was decided in March 1855 to convert the entire line to a standard- gauge railway. Ophir was returned to Swindon to be rebuilt with <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels,</b> returning in November 1855, and the railway completed {{by the summer of}} 1856.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, many speeders were {{replaced}} with trucks (usually pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles) using <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> {{that could be}} lowered for on-rail (called road-rail vehicles or hi-rails for highway-railroad). Speeders are collected by hobbyists, who refurbish them for excursions organized by the North American Railcar Operators Association in the U.S. and Canada and the Australian Society of Section Car Operators, Inc. in Australia.|$|R
50|$|An {{inspection}} locomotive was {{a special}} type of steam locomotive designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property. They were fitted with passenger car-like bodywork and seating. Many railroads {{in the nineteenth century}} owned one, but their use dwindled in the twentieth century. They were replaced with converted passenger-car inspection cars, or HiRail trucks, automobiles fitted with steel <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before {{the era of}} the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the 1830s, many collieries used wooden waggonways to {{move the}} mineral. By the eighteenth century these had {{achieved}} a degree of sophistication with proper guidance systems, and <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> on the waggons had become widespread, although not universal. These waggonways were developed principally on Tyneside, and in Shropshire, and the technology was disseminated at first from those places.|$|R
50|$|Christopher Blackett, {{proprietor}} of the Wylam colliery near Newcastle, heard of the success in Wales and wrote to Trevithick asking for locomotive designs. These were sent to John Whitfield at Gateshead, Trevithick's agent, who in 1804 built what was probably the first locomotive to have <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels.</b> Blackett was using wooden rails for his tramway and, once again, Trevithick's machine was to prove too heavy for its track.|$|R
5000|$|A flange is an {{external}} or internal ridge, or rim (lip), for strength, as the flange of an iron beam {{such as an}} I-beam or a T-beam; or for attachment to another object, as the flange {{on the end of}} a pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the lens mount of a camera; or for a flange of a rail car or tram <b>wheel.</b> Thus <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> are wheels with a flange on one side to keep the wheels from running off the rails. The term [...] "flange" [...] is also used for a kind of tool used to form flanges. Pipes with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.|$|R
2500|$|Outram's rails were {{superseded}} by William Jessop's cast iron edge rails where <b>flanged</b> <b>wheels</b> {{ran on the}} top edge of simple bar-shaped rails without the guiding ledges of Outram's flanged plate rails. The rails had been first employed in 1789 at Nanpantan at the Loughborough Charnwood Forest Canal. Such rails could be manufactured in [...] lengths. Jessop, a former pupil of John Smeaton, became a partner with Outram in 1790 in the latter's Butterley ironworks.|$|R
