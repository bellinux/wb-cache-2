500|$|Hawley {{noted that}} many US {{television}} series are filmed in Vancouver, and it [...] "offers an amazing array of looks and feels and, obviously, a great crew base and everything." [...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the <b>ice</b> <b>room</b> inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like thick sheets of ice.

This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley".

5000|$|The boat {{enters the}} <b>ice</b> <b>room</b> where {{temperatures}} of around -20 °C and artificial snow are faced, {{in the style}} of Fimbulwinter. Perspex figures, simulating skeleton warrior-style and tiger ice sculptures watch you pass by. The boat proceeds around this room and into darkness again where there is a sharp drop of some 60 feet and 70 degree incline [...] If you look forward, you are able to see two small lights. These lights indicate the entrance of the first drop. Around halfway down the drop there is a blanket of mist and lighting effects which lead the rider to believe that the ride is about to level off before it eventually plunges into water below. Right before the drop, riders can sometimes see a spiked log come into view before the bottom of the drop is visible, however it is difficult at times to see this clearly. If riders are also quick enough on the drop, they will see a large longship wrecked on their right hand side and the 2nd drop to their left.|$|E

5000|$|Jyoti {{has found}} out that her friend who is just like a sister to her, Rashmi's baby's father, {{is none other than}} Kabir's younger brother Vikrant. Jyoti makes a plan to get them married. After many {{complications}} she succeeds, but Vikrant does not accept Rashmi or the baby; he treats them very badly. Chachisa has gone to a professional to get Jyoti killed. When the killer comes for Jyoti, Jyoti misunderstands that he is here to kill Kabir. The killer shoots, Jyoti jumps in front of Kabir, and the bullet hits her. Jyoti ends up in ICU and is very critical. Kabir stays with her the whole night. Jyoti kept on hearing cries from the ward next door. She then goes to see who it was. It was a girl called Roshni, Jyoti's real baby. Jyoti took the baby and rocked her in her arms. The baby eventually stopped crying. Jyoti left the ward when the baby fell asleep. The next day Jyoti was ready to leave the hospital and go home. Jyoti forgot to take her watch so she goes back to the hospital to pick it up. Jyoti also discovers that the baby is not in its ward. She asks the doctor where she is. The doctor says she got really ill so they had {{to take her to the}} <b>ice</b> <b>room.</b> Jyoti then takes the baby home to look after because Pankaj is busy. When Jyoti gives back Roshni she forgot to give Roshni's bag back too. She then turns it round and sees that the baby's name is Roshni Vashisht: her baby. She goes to Pankaj's house and asks for Roshni back. Pankaj rufuses and asks [...] "Who do you want more Roshni or Kabir?" ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a BIM model for a stratified historic structure characterized by a complex geometry: Filarete’s Ospedale Maggiore ice house, {{one of the few remaining}} historic ice houses in Milan (Fig. 1). Filarete, a well-known Renaissance architect and theorist, planned the hospital in the 15 th century, but the ice house was built two centuries later with a double-storey irregular octagonal brick structure, half under and half above ground, that enclosed another circular structure called the <b>ice</b> <b>room.</b> The purpose of the double-walled structure was to store ice in the middle and store and preserve perishable food and medicine at the outer side of the <b>ice</b> <b>room.</b> During World War II, major portions of the hospital and the above-ground section of the ice house was bombed and heavily damaged. Later, in 1962, the hospital was restored and rehabilitated into a university, with the plan to conceal the ice house’s remaining structure in the courtyard, which ultimately was excavated and incorporated into a new library for the university. A team of engineers, architects, and students from Politecnico di Milano and Carleton University conducted two heritage recording surveys in 2015 and 2016 to fully document the existing condition of the ice house, resulting in an inclusive laser scanner and photogrammetric point cloud dataset. The point cloud data was consolidated and imported into two leading parametric modelling software, Autodesk Revit© and Graphisoft ArchiCAD©, with the goal to develop two BIMs in parallel in order to study and compare the software BIM workflow, parametric capabilities, attributes to capture the complex geometry with high accuracy, and the duration for parametric modelling. The comparison study of the two software revealed their workflow limitations, leading to integration of the BIM generative process with other pure modelling software such as Rhinoceros©. The integrative BIM process led to the production of a comprehensive BIM model that documented related historic data and the existing physical state of the ice house, to be used as a baseline for preventive maintenance, monitoring, and future conservation projects...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} of the magnetic reversal of permalloy artificial spin ice arrays. The main research foci include the influence of domain wall propagation on the magnetic reversal of honeycomb artificial spin ice, the low temperature behaviour of honeycomb artificial spin ice and the classification of inverse permalloy opals as three dimensional artificial spin <b>ice.</b> <b>Room</b> temperature imaging of the magnetisation configuration of the nanobars through the magnetic reversal, via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, photoemission electron microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, showed non random domain wall propagation through the frustrated vertices of the honeycomb artificial spin ice arrays. OOMMF simulations suggest that the origin of such non-randomness lies in the domain wall chirality. Boundary conditions necessary for domain wall injection into artificial spin ice arrays were investigated. A reduction of the edge nanobars width of 2 / 3 was needed to prevent random domain wall nucleation from the array edges. Electrical transport measurements showed evidence {{of a change in}} the magnetic reversal, driven by domain wall propagation, of honeycomb permalloy artificial spin ice below 15 K. The transition temperature was found to be proportional to the square of the saturation magnetisation of the ferromagnetic material used. The change in the magnetic reversal was associated with the non-random vertex domain wall positioning below the transition temperature due to the influence of vertex dipole interactions. Room temperature Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images and temperature dependent electrical transport measurements of three dimensional permalloy inverse opals showed the potential of magnetic inverse opals to act as three dimensional artificial spin ice systems.
