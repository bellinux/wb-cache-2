40|$|Eight {{years of}} records for 1495 2 -year old beef heifer calvings from two Kansas ranches were {{analyzed}} {{to determine the}} cause and effect• of calving difficulty on subsequent reproductive performance and weaning weights of progeny. The study involved two herds of Simmental cattle (spring and <b>fall</b> <b>calving)</b> and one herd of <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> Angus cattle. Heifers were classified as either requiring or not requiring assistance with their first calf. Herds were analyzed separately. Percentages of heifers requiring assistance for the Angus, spring calving Simmental and <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> Simmental herds were 36 %, 57 % and 38 %, respectively. In all herds, calves from 2 -year-old heifers requiring assistance were 5. 5 to 10. 3 lbs heavier at birth and had a 4. 5 to 10 % higher mortality rate than calves from unassisted heifers. Overall conception during a subsequent 63 day breeding season after their first calf was 9 % lower for assisted than unassisted heifers. Angus heifers requiring assistance were 8 days younger at their first parturition. Spring calving Simmental heifers requiring assistance delivered 15 % fewer calves within the first 21 days of the subsequent calving season. Calves from <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> Simmental heifers requiring assistance weaned (unadjusted) 18 lb heavier. Nineteen percent more heifers requiring assistance with their first calf also had required assistance during their own birth.

Weaning weights (WW) from 40, 915 Angus calves raised on 69 ranches located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, born in the Spring and Fall from 1974 to 1997, were used. The data set contained 12, 706 birth weight and 22, 448 yearling weight (YW) records. The analyses were made using two models: the first, including all the interaction terms, was set up to verify the effect of two by two interactions involving calving season and the effects of S, AoD and AC, and the second with those effects nested within calving season, to compare pre- and post-weaning performance of Spring and <b>Fall</b> <b>calves.</b> The interactions of calving season with S (P< 0. 0001), AoD (P< 0. 0001) and AC (P< 0. 05) were significant.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} providing a liquid, high-protein supplement during the fall grazing period on beef cow and calf performance. Mature, pregnant, spring-calving cows (n= 122) grazing native range were assigned to supplementation treatments. All calves were weaned on October 15. Control cows received no fall supplementation and then were handfed a dry supplement (40 % crude protein; as fed basis) from December 17 until calving. Supplemented cows were either allowed access to a liquid protein supplement (40 % crude protein; as-fed basis) approximately 2 months before weaning until <b>calving</b> (<b>fall</b> supplementation from August 14 to December 17) or from weaning until <b>calving</b> (<b>fall</b> supplementation from October 15 to December 17). Supplement intake of the control cows from December 17 until calving was adjusted to match the estimated supplement intake of the liquid-fed groups and was prorated and fed 3 days/week. Supplementation was terminated upon calving, at which time all cows were treated similarly. Provision of liquid supplement during the fall increased cow body weight and body condition in the post-weaning period. However, cows not supplemented during the fall phase were able to overcome their lesser previous nutrition when they were suitably supplemented during the winter phase.

Fall born calves which were single suckled and weaned at approximately 200 days of age served as controls. An evaluation of the effects of twin fostering on maternal-filial behavior and of the effects of cross suckling on calf growth in early life was also conducted. Delayed weaning was evaluated as a model for the demonstration of the effects of metabolizable protein intake on calf growth.

The efficiency (# landed / # struck) of the hunt was 82 %, {{which is about the}} average during 1999 - 2008 (mean = 78 %, SD = 8 %). Spring hunts are logistically more difficult than autumn hunts because of cold weather conditions and the dynamic physical challenges associated with hunting whales in sea ice. Typically, hunt efficiency during spring is lower than autumn. In 2009, however, the efficiency of the spring hunt (85 %) was somewhat similar to the autumn efficiency (80 %). This is likely due to the extremely difficult environmental conditions during spring 2009, which resulted in relatively few strikes at Barrow, Wainwright and Point Hope. The few strikes that were used were mostly successful. Of the landed whales, 18 were females, 12 were males, and sex was not determined for one animal.

In year 2, cows were administered bST every 2 weeks. In each year, 40 cows (20 primiparous in year 1 and 12 primiparous in year 2) were grazed. Of the 40 cows in year 1, 27 (14 primiparous) grazed the grass paddocks and 13 (6 primiparous) grazed the mixed paddocks. In year 2, all 40 cows grazed grass paddocks as one group. Intensive rotational grazing was practiced by using electric fences to allocate grazing areas. Fresh paddocks were provided every 24 hr. Results and Discussion Milk yield declined upon turning cows out to pasture (Fig. 1). The decline was less in year 1 with the grass-legume pasture than for the all grass pasture. The decline in milk production upon turning cows out to pasture in year 2 was even more evident (Fig. 2). This may reflect the higher milk production level when cows were placed on pasture, {{probably due to the}} use of bST, as well as the absence of legume species in the pasture. Total lactation yields for a 308 day lactation were: (year 1) 19, 520 lb for cows on all grass, and 20, 120 lb for the mixed grass-legume pasture; (year 2) 22, 120 lb for all cows given bST and on all grass pasture.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of calving season and cow wintering systems on cow and calf performance and economics from conception to slaughter, the effect of supplementing steers dried distillers grains while grazing cool season dominated meadow, and a meta-analysis was conducted {{to determine the effect}} supplementing dried distillers grains to cattle in forage based growing systems. In the first experiment, cows were bred to calve in spring, summer or fall. Calves from each system were managed as calf-feds or yearlings and followed through finishing. Altering calving season impacted cow BW and BCS but did not affect re-breeding performance or the percent of cows to calve. However, <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> cows produced fewer weaned calves compared to spring and summer calving cows. In addition, there was a significant effect of calving season on calf finishing performance and economics. Wintering system did not affect performance or profitability of cow systems. The second study evaluated dried distillers grain supplementation to steers grazing cool season meadow. Results from this study suggest that lower levels of DDGS supplementation (0. 6 % BW) do not effect summer ADG or ending BW. However, when supplementation was increased (1. 2 % BW) ADG and ending BW were increased. In addition, supplementing dried distillers grains to calves grazing cool season meadow did not affect subsequent feedlot performance but BW at harvest was greater for steers supplemented dried distillers grains. The third study, evaluated dried distillers grains supplementation to cattle in forage based growing systems across multiple studies. Results from this study indicate that cattle supplemented dried distillers grains have greater gains during summer grazing. In addition, increasing the level of dried distillers grains supplementation results in a quadratic increase in ADG and ending BW. Supplementing dried distillers grains resulted in increased overall intake but decreased forage intake with increasing level of dried distillers grains. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of puerperal metritis prevalence in high yielding Holstein cows on productive (305 days, actual milk yields), reproductive (days to first estrus, days open and services per conception) variables and culling rates. Throughout the study, 2885 dairy records were collected from high yielding private Holstein dairy farm (average milk yield was up to 9000 kg) for 3 successive lactation seasons. Dairy cows were classified according to their uterine affection into two groups, healthy and those with puerperal metritis. Dairy cows which affected with puerperal metritis were diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of lactation. Metritic cows were diagnosed and treated at the discretion of the herd veterinarian. Affected dairy cows were grouped into four groups according to time of the puerperal metritis attack during the first 21 Days In Milk (DIM) as ( 15 DIM, respectively). Moreover, the dairy females were grouped into 3 groups according to frequency of puerperal metritis of once, twice and triple, respectively. Dairy cows were also grouped according to their calving season (winter, spring, summer and <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> seasons). Productive, reproductive variables and culling due to puerperal metritis were detected from the on-farm record system (DairyComp 305). Results of this study revealed that, puerperal metritis had bad effects on high yielding cows productive and reproductive variables, that decreased the 305 milk yield, increased days to first estrus, days open and number of services per conception. Moreover, the occurrence of puerperal metritis increased during the warm months of spring and summer seasons. Also, the occurrence of such disease was increased during the first 10 days of postpartum as (89. 98 %) of the affected cases occurred within this period.

40|$|Performance testing {{data from}} a {{registered}} herd of Hereford cattle in Northern Utah for the years 1974 through 1980 were analyzed in this study. The cattle consisted of a spring calving herd, approximately 440 cows, and a <b>fall</b> <b>calving</b> herd, approximately 120 cows. Five weaning traits (weaning weight, weight per day of age, 205 -day weaning weight, 205 -dat adjusted weaning weight, weaning index) and four yearling traits (yearling weight, average daily gain, 365 -day adjusted yearling weight, yearling index) were computed on the offspring from both herds, for the years mentioned, to test {{the influence of a}} performance testing program on the productivity in the test herd. Weaning weight increased from 346. 0 lbs. in 1974 to 404. 0 lbs. in 1977, an increase of 58 lbs [...] A decline was experienced in the succeeding years 404. 0 lbs. in 1977 to 380. 2 lbs. in 1980, a decline of 23. 8 lbs [...] Yearling weight increased from 649. 0 lbs. in 1975 to 717. 7 lbs. in 1977, an increase of 68. 7 lbs. A decline of 29. 4 lbs. was observed in 1978 and an increase of 11. 2 lbs. from 1978 to 1980. Other influences on weaning traits and yearling traits such as age of dam, age at weaning, season of birth and heritabilities were also observed. Age of dam influence was compared to additive adjustment factors recommended by the Beef Improvement Federation and found to be comparable to age nine. Adjustment factors for dams from nine through eleven years of age was recommended to be 12. 0, 20. 0, and 30. 0 pounds respectively for both males and females. Adjustment for 12 -year old dams was 40. 0 and 42. 0 pounds for males and females respectively and for 13 -year old dams a 44. 0 and 54. 0 pound adjustment for males and females respectively. Age at weaning was found to be most applicable when limited from 160 to 250 days as presently recommended by the Beef Improvement Federation, with 205 -day weight as the optimum weight. Season of birth significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 1) favored the spring calving season. Warmer weather and availability of better feed seemed to be the major influencing factors. Heritabilities for weaning weight, 205 -day weaning weight, 2015 -day adjusted weaning weight and weaning index were computed to be 0. 142, 0. 142, 0. 136 and 0. 113 respectively. Heritabilities for yearling weight, average daily gain, 365 -day adjusted yearling weight and yearling index were 0. 246, 0. 120, 0. 252 and 0. 244 respectively. These heritabilities are lower than most reported in the literature. Longer calving season, two calving herds and above average range of ages at which weaning and yearling traits were taken could have influenced these heritabilities downward...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{production}}, hay {{production and}} feeding, and the yields {{and composition of}} forage from summer and winter grass-legume pastures and winter corn crop residue fields from a year-round grazing system were {{compared with those of}} a conventional system. The year-round grazing system utilized 1. 67 acres of smooth bromegrass-orchardgrass-birdsfoot trefoil pasture per cow in the summer, and 1. 25 acres of stockpiled tall fescue-red clover pasture per cow, 1. 25 acres of stockpiled smooth bromegrass-red clover pasture per cow, and 1. 25 acres of corn crop residues per cow during winter for spring- and fall-calving cows and stockers. First-cutting hay was harvested from the tall fescue-red clover and smooth bromegrass-red clover pastures to meet supplemental needs of cows and calves during winter. In the conventional system (called the minimal land system), spring-calving cows grazed smooth bromegrass-orchardgrass-birdsfoot trefoil pastures at 3. 33 acres/cow during summer with first cutting hay removed from one-half of these acres. This hay was fed to these cows in a drylot during winter. All summer grazing was done by rotational stocking for both systems, and winter grazing of the corn crop residues and stockpiled forages for pregnant spring-calving cows and lactating fall-calving cows in the year-round system was managed by strip-stocking. Hay was fed to springcalving cows in both systems to maintain a mean body condition score of 5 on a 9 -point scale, but was fed to fall-calving cows to maintain a mean body condition score of greater than 3. Over winter, fall-calving cows lost more body weight and condition than spring calving cows, but there were no differences in body weight or condition score change between spring-calving cows in either system. Fall- and spring-calving cows in the yearround grazing system required 934 and 1, 395 lb. hay dry matter/cow for maintenance during the winter whereas spring-calving cows in drylot required 4, 776 lb. hay dry matter/cow. Rebreeding rates were not affected by management system. Average daily gains of spring-born calves did not differ between systems, but were greater than <b>fall</b> <b>calves.</b> Because of differences in land areas for the two systems, weight production of calves per acre of cows in the minimal land system was greater than those of the year-round grazing system, but when the additional weight gains of the stocker cattle were considered, production of total growing animals did not differ between the two systems...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{traditional}} {{practice on}} beef cow-calf ranches {{in the high}} desert region of Eastern Oregon has been to breed the cows to calve in the Spring months. Interest has been growing recently {{in the practice of}} Fall-calving; that is, breeding cows to calve in the months of October and November. The Squaw Butte Experiment Station at Burns, Oregon, began a Fall-calving program with part of their range beef herd several years ago. They found that climatic conditions are generally more favorable for <b>calving</b> in the <b>Fall,</b> resulting in higher weaned-calf percentages. Calves from both Spring and Fall-calving herds were weaned in late Summer, with <b>Fall</b> <b>calves</b> averaging around 500 pounds compared with 330 pounds for the Spring calves. There was little doubt about the biological feasibility of the Fall-calving practice in that area, but its economic feasibility was somewhat in question. The purpose of this research was to analyze the economic aspects of Fall-calving and determine what are the most important factors in deciding its economic feasibility. A linear programming model was developed for comparing Fall and Spring-calving systems under different conditions. The model was designed to maximize net returns to labor, management and fixed resources in the beef enterprise. This model took account of range forage utilization patterns. Solutions from the model indicated that Spring-calving systems may have slightly higher net returns than Fall-calving because of two main differences: (1) the lighter Spring-born calves bring a higher average price per cwt., and (2) the Fall-calving herd requires about 1500 pounds more Winter hay than cows in the Spring-calving herd. An algebraic relationship was found between calf price differentials and the price of meadow hay, which would equate the net return values for Spring and Fall-calving systems. With an expected differential of 2. 95, between the average prices of calves sold from the Spring and Fall-calving herds, it was found that a price as low as 14. 12 per ton of meadow hay would be needed to equate the net returns of a Fall-calving system with those of a Spring-calving system (with calf sales on September 1). Labor costs {{were not included in the}} model, but the ranch operator's labor situation may well be the most important element in his decision to go with Fall rather than Spring calving. The main difference is in the times of the year that labor is needed. The Fall-calving system needs more labor in the Fall, and the Spring-calving system needs even more in the Spring...|$|R

40|$|Performance and {{economics}} of calf feeding and feeding long-yearlings was compared from University of Nebraska research conducted from 1996 to 2004. All calves {{in these studies}} were spring born and purchased the subsequent <b>fall.</b> The heaviest <b>calves</b> (292 ± 5 kg) were placed into the feedlot and fed an average of 168 d (calf-feds), whereas the lighter calves (239 ± 5 kg) were placed into a long-yearling system consisting of corn residue grazing followed by summer grazing before entering the feedlot for finishing. Long-yearlings were fed in the feedlot {{for an average of}} 90 d. At the beginning of the finishing period, long-yearlings were 143 kg heavier than calf-feds (P 3 ̆c 0. 01).

Seven treatments were imposed: 1) fall-born calves put directly into the feedlot on May 7, 1996; 2) fall-born calves put on pasture and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30, 3) <b>fall</b> born <b>calves</b> put on pasture on May 7 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on July 30; 4) fall-born calves put on pasture on May 7 and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; 5) fall-born calves put on pasture on May 7 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; 6) spring-born calves put on pasture on October 1 and receiving an ionophore and moved to the feedlot on October 22; and 7) spring-born calves put on pasture on October 1 and not receiving an ionophore and moved to feedlot on October 22. Performance data showed that cattle on pasture receiving an ionophore had higher gains than those not receiving an ionophore on pasture. This trend was reversed in the feedlot period.

40|$|A year-round grazing {{system for}} spring- and fall-calving cows was {{developed}} to compare animal production and performance, hay production and feeding, winter forage composition changes, and summer pasture yield and nutrient composition to that from a conventional, or minimal land system. Systems compared forage from smooth bromegrass-orchardgrass-birdsfoot trefoil pastures for both systems {{in the summer and}} corn crop residues and stockpiled grass-legume pastures for the year-round system to drylot hay feeding during winter for the minimal land system. The year-round grazing system utilized 1. 67 acres of smooth bromegrassorchardgrass- birdsfoot trefoil (SB-O-T) pasture per cow in the summer, compared with 3. 33 acres of (SB-O-T) pasture per cow in the control (minimal land) system. In addition to SB-O-T pastures, the year-round grazing system utilized 2. 5 acres of tall fescue-red clover (TFRC) and 2. 5 acres of smooth bromegrass-red clover (SBRC) per cow for grazing in both mid-summer and winter for fall- and spring-calving cows, respectively. First-cutting hay was harvested from the TF-RC and SB-RC pastures, and regrowth was grazed for approximately 45 days in the summer. These pastures were then fertilized with 40 lbs N/acre and stockpiled for winter grazing. Also utilized during the winter for spring-calving cows in the year-round grazing system were corn crop residue (CCR) pastures at an allowance of 2. 5 acres per cow. In the minimal land system, hay was harvested from three-fourths of the area in SB-O-T pastures and stored for feeding in a drylot through the winter. Summer grazing was managed with rotational stocking for both systems, and winter grazing of stockpiled forages and corn crop residues by year-round system cows was managed by strip-stocking. Hay was fed to maintain a body condition score of 5 on a 9 point scale for spring-calving cows in both systems. Hay was supplemented as needed to maintain a body condition score of 3 for fall-calving cows nursing calves through the winter. Although initial condition scores for cows in both systems were different at the initiation of grazing for both winter and summer, {{there were no significant differences}} (P 3 ̆e. 05) in overall condition score changes throughout both grazing seasons. In year 1, fall-calving cows in the year-round grazing system lost more (P 3 ̆c. 05) body weight during winter than spring-calving cows in either system. In year 2, there were no differences seen in weight changes over winter for any group of cows. Average daily gains of <b>fall</b> <b>calves</b> in the yearround system were 1. 9 lbs/day compared with weight gains of 2. 5 lbs/day for spring calves from both systems. Yearly growing animal production from pastures for both years did not differ between systems when weight gains of stockers that grazed summer pastures in the year-round grazing system were added to weight gains of suckling calves. Carcass characteristics for all calves finished in the feedlot for both systems were similar. There were no significant differences in hay production between systems for year 1; however, amounts of hay needed to maintain cows were 923, 1373, 4732 lbs dry matter/cow for year-round fall-calving, year-round spring-calving, and minimal land spring-calving cows, respectively. In year 2, hay production per acre in the minimal land system was greater (P 3 ̆c. 05) than for the year-round system, but the amounts of hay required per cow were 0, 0, and 4720 lbs dry matter/cow for yearround fall-calving, year-round spring-calving, and minimal land spring-calving cows, respectively...|$|R
