5000|$|Material {{is put on}} a sinter {{machine in}} two layers. The bottom layer may vary in {{thickness}} from 30 to 75 mm. A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, {{also referred to as}} the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of 350 to 660 mm. The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine [...] The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the <b>ignition</b> <b>furnace</b> into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked {{from the bottom of the}} bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( [...] 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of gypsum plasterboard assemblies is typically evaluated {{in accordance with}} standardised test methods such as BS 476, AS 1530 or ASTM E 119. Standard time-temperature curves give good comparison between tested materials. However, they are generally less severe than a typical short duration compartment fire, {{they do not have}} a decay phase, and may be conservative for long duration fires. It is not common knowledge that test time-temperature relationships, such as ISO 834, have not significantly changed since they were originally formulated in the early 1930 s. Full-scale compartment testing based on typical residential scenarios conducted as part of this study, revealed that temperatures within a compartment can far exceed those of standard time-temperature curves within several minutes of <b>ignition.</b> Pilot-scale <b>furnace</b> testing to non-standard time-temperature curves has revealed that the {{performance of}} light framed gypsum plasterboard assemblies is highly dependent on the severity of the fire exposure.

A. SCOPE This test method provides a procedure to determine the binder content of bituminous paving mixtures by removing the binder at approximately 570 °C by <b>ignition</b> in a <b>furnace.</b> The results of this test method may be affected by the type of aggregate in the mixture because different aggregates lose mass on ignition to varying degrees.

40|$|The {{choice of}} process {{parameters}} {{is critical in}} optimizing the mechanical properties of sandwich structures produced using the vacuum bagging technique. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze how the viscosity of the resin/curing agent system and the vacuum level influence the morphology and the mechanical behavior of sandwich beams with composite faces (epoxy resin and glass fiber fabric named COMBI 900) and a PVC foam core. Four different sandwich structures were produced by varying the viscosity of the epoxy resin/curing agent at constant maximum vacuum pressure. Three further structures were manufactured by varying the strength of the vacuum with the resin viscosity maintained constant at the minimum level. Three point bending tests were carried out on all seven sandwiches. The analysis shows that although both parameters affect the mechanical characteristics of the structure, the viscosity of the resin system is clearly the more influential of the two. The morphological structure of the sandwiches was analyzed both by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and by muffle <b>furnace</b> <b>ignition</b> to calculate the percentage of fibers, matrices, and voids present in the different sample...|$|R

Full-scale compartment testing based on typical residential scenarios conducted as part of this study, revealed that temperatures within a compartment can far exceed those of standard time-temperature curves within several minutes of <b>ignition.</b> Pilot-scale <b>furnace</b> testing to non-standard time-temperature curves has revealed that the {{performance of}} light framed gypsum plasterboard assemblies is highly dependent on the severity of the fire exposure. A system that has achieved a fire resistance rating of 60 minutes failed within 30 minutes to a fire exposure that would represent a moderate compartment fire. Current fire engineering designs often use sophisticated evacuation models to calculate minimum escape times required for safe evacuation of occupants. These evacuation times typically fall in the range from 15 - 60 minutes. The suitability of protecting escape routes using barriers rated against a standard fire test is questioned. SAPIR, a powerful finite element program, has been employed to predict the thermal behaviour of various gypsum plasterboard assemblies exposed to a range of nonstandard fires. Results from the computer modelling are compared with several full and pilot scale furnace tests. It was found that the model calibrated to results from standard ISO 834 furnace testing provided reasonable predictions of temperatures within assemblies exposed to a moderate fire. Temperature predictions of assemblies exposed to severe fires were poor...|$|R
40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{models were}} developed and compared {{for the analysis}} of uranium combustion and <b>ignition</b> in a <b>furnace.</b> Both a semi-analytical solution and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical solution were obtained. Prediction of uranium oxidation rates is important for fuel storage applications, fuel processing, and the development of spent fuel metal waste forms. The semi-analytical model was based on heat transfer correlations, a semi-analytical model of flow over a flat surface, and simple radiative heat transfer from the material surface. The CFD model numerically determined the flowfield over the object of interest, calculated the heat and mass transfer to the material of interest, and calculated the radiative heat exchange of the material with the furnace. The semi-analytical model is much less detailed than the CFD model, but yields reasonable results and assists in understanding the physical process. Short computation times allowed the analyst to study numerous scenarios. The CFD model had significantly longer run times, was found to have some physical limitations that were not easily modified, but was better able to yield details of the heat and mass transfer and flow field once code limitations were overcome...|$|R
40|$|To realize large {{percentage}} biomass co-firing with coal in existing coal-fired boilers, the combustion behaviour of biomass {{is expected to}} be similar or comparable to that of coal. When co-firing with coal, biomass is not necessarily to be ground as fine as the dedicated coal particles due to its higher reactivity. With aim of achieving promising performance of co-firing with dedicated coal particles, the determination of suitable particle size of biomass becomes important. The paper investigates experimentally the ignition behaviour of three biomass materials in a down-fire reactor associated with thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). TGA results showed that the devolatilization process is accelerated by the presence of oxygen, but failed to identify the impacts of particle size on the ignition behaviour of biomass. However, the ignition testing results based in the down-fire reactor clearly showed that ignition delay time of a large biomass particle is longer than that of smaller one. In addition, being injected into the furnace, the softwood particles take a longer residence time to be ignited than the straw particles at same sizes, which agrees well with their reactivity analysis in TGA. Moreover, the ignition test results suggested that the ignition mechanism of biomass could be alternated from homogeneous to the heterogeneous <b>ignition</b> when the <b>furnace</b> temperature is increasing; at high enough <b>furnace</b> temperatures, the <b>ignition</b> predictably occurs at the particle surface without requiring the start of devolatilization. The results quantitatively demonstrate the effects of particle size on the ignition delay time of biomass, which, together with the transport phenomena and surrounding atmosphere, can contribute to control the biomass combustion profile and co-firing performance...|$|R
40|$|Processing (upgrading) to dry {{and uniform}} fuels (briquettes, pellets, and powder) extend {{the use of}} biomass wastes as an energy source. Upgrading {{decreases}} transportation costs, increases storage capacity, and improves combustion properties. The intention of the present work {{was to investigate the}} effect of chemical characteristics and physical characteristics on processing, handling characteristics, combustion, and ash melting, using upgraded biofuels. The raw materials used was spring-harvested reed canary-grass (RCG) and wood residues (stemwood without bark). RCG with different ash contents was upgraded to briquettes and combustion experiments were done in a 180 kW boiler. RCG was found to be a suitable raw material for briquetting and variation in ash content did not affect the briquette quality. Combustion experiments showed that RCG can be burned with good result and the variation in ash content did not effect flue gas emissions. The ash formed during combustion showed a tendency to melt. Estimation of melting behaviour was done by ASTM fusion test, a bench scale fluidised-bed combustion test (5 kW), and by extracting melting behaviours from the ternary diagram SiO 2 -CaO-K 2 O. For RCG with low ash content (3 - 4 %), the tendency to melt was higher compared to RCG with high ash content (5 - 10 %). Wood powder cut in various impact mills and knife mills was characterised using sieve analysis, laser diffraction, image analysis, and a funnel method for measuring the tendency to bridge. The wood powder fuels were then combusted in a 150 kW powder burner to study emissions as a function of particle properties. Sieving and image analysis showed that impact mills produced wood powder with more fine particles than wood powder produced by knife mills. Image analysis showed that particle shapes differed between the two types of mills. The bridging tendency was higher for powder produced by impact mills than by knife mills. Combustion experiments showed that particle characteristics affected fuel feeding, <b>ignition,</b> unburned pollutants, <b>furnace</b> temperature, and content of unburned matter in ash. An increased content of smaller particles had a negative effect on fuel feeding and NO emissions were slightly increased while it had a positive effect on ignition, unburned pollutants (decreased) and content unburned matter (decreased) ...|$|R
40|$|Combustible dusts {{explosion}} risk {{depends on a}} huge number of dust characteristics which allows the analyst to assess its behavior at different conditions. To characterize dust behavior {{a huge number of}} parameters can be measured according to several technical standards. In general, each standard describes how to measure a single parameter, which characterize a specific dust behavior. Nowadays there's no standard conceived to simply determine if the dust can cause an explosion. As available standard tests are often costly in terms of time and money for both laboratory analysts and customers, moreover the latter are sometimes in the condition to submit to expensive tests dust samples that could not explode. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a simplified and straightforward test that can assess whether a dust is explosible or not. The test is called Speditive Esplosibility Test (SET). It is composed of 4 different tests, each of them representing a different ignition mechanism derived from standards procedures. These are: -High voltage continuous arc ignition and glowing wire ignition in Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); -Dust cloud <b>ignition</b> in G-G <b>furnace</b> and dust layer ignition on hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). In this context the 4 experimental procedures were slightly modified respect to standards procedures: the test conditions have to be "as worst as possible" in terms of energy transferred to the sample. This approach assure that also dusts that have relative weak tendency to ignite is considered and classified. The test classifies dusts in 3 categories: explosible at ambient temperature (in case of ignition in Hartmann tube tests), explosible at high temperature (in case of ignition in GG or hot plate tests), not explosible (in case of no ignition). Fundamentally, the test procedure is configured as a statistical investigation in which a defined number of tests is made. Screening test has been performed for several types of dusts and results compared with kst tests in 20 l Siwek Sphere for some of the samples. Results sees to confirm the hypothesis of the Screening Test and its reliability to assess explosibility of combustible dust...|$|R
