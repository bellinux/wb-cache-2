5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities sidewalks remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|Robin Hood Gate {{takes its}} name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called the Robin Hood {{roundabout}} on the A3. Widened in 1907, it has been closed to motorised vehicles since a 2003 traffic reduction trial. Alterations commenced in March 2013 to make the gates more suitable <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> use and return some of the hard surface to parkland.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E
25|$|Estimated in 1991 to cost $2.88 million, {{the bridge}} was {{designed}} as a flyover from Roe Street, accommodating two bus lanes, and a shared use path <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and cycle movements. To construct the bridge, a significant amount of land then occupied by a Perth City Council car park, and a number of buildings, would have to be compulsorily acquired.|$|E

25|$|The only carrier {{to exist}} in Bermuda folded in 1948 and was {{converted}} to a rail trail in 1984. Some of the former right of way has been converted for automobile traffic, but 18 miles are reserved <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> use and bicycles on paved portions. The rail bed spans {{the length of the}} island, and connected Hamilton to St. George's and several villages, though several bridges are derelict, causing the trail to be fragmented.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit International Riverfront {{includes}} a 5½-mile (8.8km) promenade called the River Walk {{which is to}} extend from the Ambassador Bridge to Belle Isle. The path is located directly on the river, sometimes bridging it. The path is 62 feet (18¾ m) wide in most places, with separate lanes <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and wheeled (such as bicycles or inline skate) traffic. Pavilions, fishing piers and benches are located at intervals along the path.|$|E
25|$|The Erez Crossing is a {{pedestrian}} and cargo crossing into Israel, located in northern Gaza. The crossing is currently restricted to Arab residents {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Palestinian Authority and to Egyptian nationals or international aid officials only, and is closed to tourists.

25|$|Tested at 9.7 {{seconds to}} 100km/h for the manual model, {{it is more}} than half a second slower than its predecessor. This is likely on account of its weight, a hefty 1300kg, which is curiously more than the Civic unlike before wherein it was usually lighter. The {{automatic}} also has widely spaced ratios {{due to the lack of}} a fifth gear, giving sluggish acceleration, definitely not maximizing the engine potential. The Toyota Corolla received a 4 star ANCAP safety rating for occupant safety and a 3 star rating <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> safety.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{congestion}} pricing is a proposed traffic congestion user fee for vehicles traveling {{into the most}} congested {{areas of the city}} of San Francisco at certain periods of peak demand. The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction projects. The proposed {{congestion pricing}} charge is part of a mobility and pricing study being carried out by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) to reduce congestion at and near central locations and to reduce its associated environmental impacts, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The funds raised through the charge will be used for public transit improvement projects, and <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and bike infrastructure and enhancements.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{development}} within Knowlton has been {{tied to the}} presence of U.S. Route 46 and, since the early 1970s, Interstate 80. Many Knowlton residents use Route 80 to commute to their jobs either further east in New Jersey or further west in Pennsylvania. Route 94 crosses through the township. Two bridges cross the Delaware River, connecting the township to Pennsylvania; the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge, opened in 1953, connects Route 94 to Pennsylvania Route 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania. The two places are also connected by the Portland–Columbia Pedestrian Bridge, which dates back to a structure constructed in 1869 and was dedicated <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> use when the vehicular toll bridge was completed in 1953.|$|E

25|$|The {{work also}} {{involved}} a complete {{overhaul of the}} GO concourses, deepening them to create two storeys of space. The lower storey will provide retail space and room <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> traffic flow, and the upper storey will be dedicated to passenger traffic onto the platforms. This will expand not only the current GO concourse in {{the east of the}} building, but also open up the western end; GO Transit's presence in the building will nearly quadruple. Additional aesthetic points include glass roofs over the moat space around the north sides of the building, and a tall atrium over the central portions of the platforms. A new southern entrance, adjacent to the Air Canada Centre, opened in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Avenue Bridge {{crossing}} the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, on foot, designated bike lanes, or via free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate decks: the lower deck for vehicles {{and the newly}} constructed light rail, and the upper deck <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and bicycle traffic. An unheated enclosed walkway runs {{the length of the}} bridge and shelters students from the weather. Walking and riding bicycles are the most common modes of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for jaywalking as well as riding bicycles on restricted sidewalk areas in areas surrounding the University resulting in fines as high as $250. This is often done {{at the beginning of a}} school year or after pedestrians interfere with traffic.|$|E
25|$|Private {{vehicles}} and taxis are the predominant {{means of transport}} in Palm Beach. Bicycles are a popular transport on the island, although most areas have no bicycle trails, so safe and comfortable travel is not always assured. The Lake Trail, exclusively <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and bike traffic, extends from Royal Palm Way (State Road 704) in the south up to {{the north end of}} the island. The trail follows the edge of the Lake Worth Lagoon (part of the intercoastal waterway) except for a section between the Flagler Museum and the Biltmore Condominiums, where the trail follows the streets. Another break occurs to pass around the Sailfish Yacht Club in {{the north end of the}} island. The Lake Trail is filled daily with bikers, rollerbladers, runners, and dog-walkers.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 2003, George Russell Weller {{drove his}} Buick at speeds {{of up to}} 70 miles per hour through the busy {{downtown}} Farmers Market, which was held on a city street that was closed to vehicular traffic by temporary signage at each end. The 86-year-old driver killed 10 that day and injured 63, stopping only due the Buick's engine and transmission being clogged with body parts. The city vigorously fought against accepting its responsibility in causing the death and injuries of market patrons through {{the lack of any}} barricade. In the wake of numerous civil lawsuits filed against the City of Santa Monica and the company organizing the Farmer's Market, a new policy was adopted requiring portable concrete barricades to reliably block vehicle access <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> street events.|$|E
25|$|Numerous paved multi-use trails wind {{their way}} {{through much of the}} city, {{including}} along the Ottawa River, Rideau River, and Rideau Canal. These pathways are used for transportation, tourism, and recreation. Because many streets either have wide curb lanes or bicycle lanes, cycling is a popular mode of transportation throughout the year. As of 31 December 2015, 900km of cycling facilities are found in Ottawa, including 435km of multi use pathways, 8km of cycle tracks, 200km of on-road bicycle lanes, and 257km of paved shoulders. 204km of new cycling facilities were added between 2011 and 2014. A downtown street that is restricted to pedestrians only, Sparks Street was turned into a pedestrian mall in 1966. On Sundays (since 1960) and selected holidays and events additional avenues and streets are reserved <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> and/or bicycle uses only. In May 2011, The NCC introduced the Capital Bixi bicycle-sharing system.|$|E
25|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{announced}} in May 2009 {{that it has}} awarded the Cruze a full five stars in their independent crash safety test, with 35.04 {{out of a possible}} 37 points. The following July, the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) awarded the Cruze a maximum five stars in their independent crash safety test. The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored a maximum of 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP released its rating in November, with the Chevrolet Cruze again receiving the full five-star grading. While the Cruze scored 96percent for adult protection, and 84percent for child occupant protection, Euro NCAP's figure <b>for</b> <b>pedestrian</b> protection is quoted at significantly lower 34percent. In December 2009, the South Korean-specification Cruze—the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere—received the top rating of five stars from the Korean New Car Assessment Program (KNCAP). According to KNCAP, the Lacetti Premiere received the five-star rating in the frontal, offset frontal, side, and whiplash tests.|$|E
