25|$|The Volvo ECC (Environmental Concept Car) was {{exhibited}} at the 1992 Paris Motor Show. The vehicles range on batteries alone was 90 miles (140km), and when combined with a <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> of fuel for the turbine, about 415 miles (668km).|$|E
25|$|Using a torch, {{the crew}} {{were able to}} review their {{surroundings}} and also called their mother ship to update them. The <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> of oxygen Mallison had added had a capacity to last approximately 72 hours of oxygen, but eight hours had already been used, leaving just 66 hours left.|$|E
25|$|The first {{inclusive}} tour charter at Vigra {{was carried out}} by Stjernereiser in June 1977, contracting a Sud Aviation Caravelle from Transeuropa to Palma de Mallorca. The short runway meant that the aircraft could not take a <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> of fuel and therefore stopped in Stavanger to refuel. Vigra saw a limited amount of charter, largely since all flight had to have an intermediate landing.|$|E
50|$|As rebuilt, the Marine Crusader had {{a beam of}} 33 ft. A new {{epoxy coating}} {{was applied to the}} hull. She had {{quarters}} for an operating crew of eight. She had a gym in the forecastle, a useful accoutrement on long, ocean tow missions. With <b>full</b> <b>tanks</b> the Marine Crusader carried 225,000 gallons of fuel.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers are {{encouraged}} to start the drive from Te Anau with <b>full</b> <b>tanks</b> of fuel, as there are very limited options to refuel thereafter. [...] All of this does not discourage up to 50 coaches and hundreds of private cars daily from making the 608 km round trip from Queenstown (slightly less from Invercargill). Almost 60% travelled via coach.|$|R

25|$|The United States of America had not tested an {{anti-satellite weapon}} since 1985. In February 2008 the US {{launched}} its own strike {{to destroy a}} non-functioning US satellite, which demonstrated the capability to strike in space, though {{at a much lower}} altitude than the Chinese test. The US claims that the strike was not a military test but a necessary mission to remove the threat posed by the decaying orbit of a faulty spy satellite with a <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> of hydrazine fuel.|$|E
25|$|The Romans used {{hydraulic}} mining methods {{on a large}} scale to prospect for the veins of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing. They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large reservoirs and tanks. When a <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> was opened, the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by fire-setting to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting thermal shock cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines.|$|E
25|$|The 13th Mechanized Corps {{was formed}} in March 1941 in Bielsk Podlaski {{as part of the}} 10th Army in the Western Special Military District. Major General Pyotr Akhlyustin {{commanded}} the corps, Major General Vasily Ivanov was its deputy commander for combat troops, and Colonel Ivan Grizunov was its chief of staff. The division's 25th Tank Division was formed from the 44th Light Tank Brigade at Gomel and was later relocated to Łapy. The division had most of the corps' tanks. The 31st Tank Division was formed from the 1st Tank Brigade (Second Formation) at Gmina Boćki. By 30 May, the division had only one <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> regiment, the 62nd, with few armored vehicles. The 208th Motorized Division was formed at Hajnówka from the 14th Motorized Machine Gun-Artillery Brigade. With its positions {{in the center of the}} Białystok salient, the corps was to support the 5th Rifle Corps. By 22 June, when the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, the corps had 294 light tanks, including 263 T-26s and 15 BT tanks. A small number of T-34 and KV-1 tanks were transferred to the corps from the 6th Mechanized Corps for training purposes. The corps was at 49 percent of its strength.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{sharing the}} Jaguar D-Type with Desmond Titterington during the 1955 RAC Tourist Trophy at Dundrod, Hawthorn passed Fangio twice, {{and set the}} lap record for the RAC Tourist Trophy on the Dundrod Circuit, only to lose {{in the final stages}} when, running on <b>full</b> <b>tanks,</b> he was passed by Moss when the D Type's engine failed on the last lap.|$|R
50|$|In this Leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member {{had to pick}} a color badge in the gas station's office and then search along a line of parked tuk-tuks for 4 that had the same color marker on their windshields. They then had to lead the tuk-tuks back to the gas station to fill up their tanks to 3 L. Once all 4 tuk-tuks had <b>full</b> <b>tanks,</b> they were given their next clue.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic fluids play an {{important}} role in space transportation. Liquid oxygen and hydrogen are vital fuel components for liquid rocket engines. It is also difficult to accurately measure the liquid level in the cryogenic tanks containing the liquids. The current methods use thermocouple rakes, floats, or sonic meters to measure tank level. Thermocouples have problems examining the boundary between the boiling liquid and the gas inside the tanks. They are also slow to respond to temperature changes. Sonic meters need to be mounted inside the tank, but still above the liquid level. This causes problems for <b>full</b> <b>tanks,</b> or tanks that are being rotated to lie on their side...|$|R

500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940, the Mechanized Cavalry Regiment mobilized and fought as part of the Cavalry Division and later of the 8th Infantry Division. On 15 December, a Tank Company was formed within the regiment out of 35 L3/35 tankettes captured from the Italians in the Battle of Elaia–Kalamas. At the same time, a Tank School was set up in December in Athens, aiming to prepare Greek crews for the use of 40 Light Tank Mk IIIB [...] "Dutchman" [...] tanks promised as aid by the British; in the event, only ten of these were delivered to Greece, but the British sent also 100 Universal Carriers and 185 Austin 8 HP cars equipped with machine-guns. With this equipment at hand, the Greek GHQ issued an order (ΑΠ 7014) on 15 January 1941 for the establishment of the 19th Mechanized Division at Athens, under Major General Nikolaos Lioumbas. The division was to be structured around the Tank School, with a complement of 77 Universal Carriers and 100 Austins. The entire Mechanized Cavalry Regiment was to be incorporated in it, and further personnel was provided from the Cavalry Division (40 officers and 1,000 other ranks). Despite several applications by infantry officers, none were selected to serve in the new division, which was exclusively staffed by cavalry personnel ( [...] men). The initial order provided {{for the establishment of a}} <b>full</b> <b>tank</b> regiment and two mechanized infantry regiments, but due to the aforementioned lack of tanks this never came to pass.|$|E
50|$|Superficially, the UR-700 {{was of the}} {{well-known}} design of Soviet launchers with a central core stack and lateral strap-on boosters. But one distinguishing feature was that the engines of the first stage were cross-fed with fuel and oxidizer from the tanks of the strap-on boosters during the initial flight phase. This meant that when the boosters were spent and jettisoned, the central stack still flew with <b>full</b> <b>tanks,</b> thus reducing dead weight and increasing a possible payload.|$|R
50|$|The {{rocket pack}} could be swapped in around 20 minutes by {{removing}} six bolts. Fuelling the rocket oxidiser was potentially somewhat hazardous {{and so it}} was carried out away from other aircraft, by groundcrew in protective clothing and with a fire crew standing by in order to flush away any spillage. Acid refuelling was carried out above a steel drip tray, with the acid flow and tank vent return through closed pipework with a sightglass to observe <b>full</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
