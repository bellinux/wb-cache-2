2500|$|A riot shotgun is {{a shotgun}} <b>designed</b> <b>or</b> <b>modified</b> {{for use as}} a {{primarily}} defensive weapon, by the use of a short barrel and a larger magazine capacity than shotguns marketed for hunting. [...] The riot shotgun is used by military personnel for guard duty and was at one time used for riot control, and is commonly used as a door breaching and patrol weapon by law enforcement personnel, as well as a home defense weapon by private citizens. Guns of this type are often labeled as breaching shotguns, tactical shotguns or special-purpose shotguns to denote the larger scope of their use; however these are largely marketing terms.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} days of motor bus {{operation}} by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in the 1900s (decade) until the 1960s, London went its own way, designing its own vehicles specially for London use rather than using the bus manufacturers' standard products used elsewhere. The Associated Equipment Company (AEC) was created as a subsidiary of the LGOC in 1912 to build buses and other equipment for its parent company, and continued in the ownership of LGOC and its successors until 1962. Many of London's local service buses over this period were built by AEC, although other manufacturers also built buses to London <b>designs,</b> <b>or</b> <b>modified</b> their own <b>designs</b> for use in London.|$|R
