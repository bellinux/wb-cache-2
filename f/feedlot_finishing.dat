Lactate concentration in the blood was measured by spectrophotometry on days 1 (Lac 01), 14 (Lac 14), 27 (Lac 27) and 69 (Lac 69) of the feedlot period and immediately after slaughter (Lac 96). Fresh meat samples were collected from the Longissimus thoracis muscle for determination of luminosity (L *), red (a *) and yellow (b *) intensity, shear force and pH of unaged meat and aged for seven days. Lactate concentrations were analyzed by the PROC MIXED of the SAS program, considering in the model the effects of pen and day of blood samples collection. Simple correlations between the studied variables were estimated using the procedure CORR of the program SAS. The lactate was stable during the confinement period, with mean values equal to 4. 83 ± 0. 30 mMol/L; 5. 68 ± 0. 29 mMol/L; 5. 03 ± 0. 29 mMol/L and 4. 15 ± 0. 31 mMol/L for Lac 01, Lac 14, Lac 21 and Lac 69, respectively.

40|$|Carcasses in the Japanese beef {{market are}} rewarded for {{increased}} yield and superior meat quality traits such as marbling, fat colour, meat colour and firmness {{and texture of}} meat. Due to the relatively high cost of feedlotting New Zealand compared with North America and Australia, genetic improvement may provide a low-cost alternative for improving beef quality destined for the Japanese market. The objectives {{of this study were}} to characterise meat quality traits for a sample of New Zealand pasture-finished beef cattle and determine the potential rate of genetic gain for these traits through selection. Records on 24 146 Angus and 5 632 Hereford carcasses processed at Manawatu Beef Packers between March 1993 and August 1994 which had been evaluated for beef marbling standard (BMS), beef fat standard (BFS) and beef colour standard (BCS) were used to derive overall meat quality score. Overall meat quality score in the Japanese grading system is determined by the lowest grade from: semi-objective assessment for BMS, BFS and BCS; and subjective assessment for meat brightness, firmness and texture, fat lustre and quality. Subjective measures of meat and fat quality are not routinely recorded at this plant and therefore overall meat quality score could only account for the three recorded items. The majority of Angus and Hereford carcasses (84. 0 and 82. 9 %) had an overall meat quality score of 1 (inferior) and no carcasses had score 5 (excellent). Improvement of one grade in BMS (or BFS) for Angus carcasses decreased the proportion of score 1 carcasses to 12. 8 % (or 74. 7 %) and improved overall meat quality score from an average of 1. 17 to 1. 96 (or 1. 29). A change of one grade in BMS (or BFS) for Hereford carcasses decreased the proportion of score 1 carcasses to 16. 1 % (or 66. 8 %) and changed overall meat quality score from an average of 1. 18 to 1. 90 (or 1. 35). Selection based on a well-designed progeny test would take 5 (or 9) years to improve BMS (or BFS) by one grade. Biological factors introduce a lag of at least six years from the start of test matings until there can be widespread harvest of beef cattle with improved meat quality. Selection for BMS can improve overall meat quality score more effectively and more rapidly than selection for other meat quality traits. Some Angus sires used in New Zealand are sourced from North America where sire expected progeny differences (EPD) for carcass traits are based on performance of <b>feedlot</b> <b>finished</b> progeny. Sires may rank differently based on progeny records from feedlot-finished cattle (North America) and pasture-finished progeny performance in New Zealand. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine importance of genotype by environment interaction effects when sires from a New Zealand Angus progeny test programme were evaluated based on pasture-finished and feedlot-finished progeny records. Fourteen Angus sires were evaluated for live weight, carcass and meat quality traits based on records from pasture and <b>feedlot</b> <b>finished</b> steer progeny. Estimated breeding values (EBV's) of sires were obtained using a Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) procedure. Correlations between sire EBV's estimated from pasture and feedlot-finished progeny records ranged from - 0. 16 (for meat colour) to 0. 50 (for subcutaneous fat depth). There were no significant (P< 0. 05) sire by environment interaction effects, which may have due to differences in site and method of measurement of traits and different slaughter facilities. Rank correlations between sire EBV's ranged from - 0. 13 (for fat colour) to 0. 49 (for subcutaneous fat depth).

40|$|In Brazil, the {{national}} inventories on methane emission {{are carried out}} using the Tier 2 approach published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although, IPCC recommends {{the use of a}} more specific Tier 3 approach, this is hampered by a lack of consolidated data for development, evaluation and application of such a Tier 3 approach. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the effect of improving diet quality by feeding supplements on methane emission, calculated by both a Tier 2 and an extant Tier 3 approach, in different production systems of beef cattle in Brazil: (1) high quality diet and feedlot feeding from weaning to slaughter- FSFF - <b>Feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> (14 mth); (2) energy and protein supplementation - ESPF - Pasture finishing (20 mth); (3) protein supplementation during dry and wet season - PSFF - <b>Feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> (24 mth); (4) protein supplementation dry at first and second dry seasons combined with ad libitum mineral salt supplementation and protein supplementation wet at first and second wet season, respectively- PSPF - Pasture finishing (30 mth); (5) urea supplementation with mineral salt during the dry season and ad libitum salt during the wet season - USFF - <b>Feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> (36 mth); (6) urea salt during the dry season and ad libitum mineral salt during the wet season - USPF - Pasture finishing (44 mth). Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches estimated a profound effect of supplementation on methane emission. Tier 2 estimates ranged from 168 (USPF) to 35 kg per animal (FSFF) while Tier 3 estimates ranged from 145 (USPF) to 32 (FSFF) kg per animal.

40|$|The {{response}} of cattle to alterations in social groupings {{can lead to}} physiological changes that affect meat quality. Feedlot practices frequently lead to a proportion of cattle in a pen being drafted for slaughter with the balance retained for a further period until they meet market specifications. An ability to regroup such retained cattle for short periods without consequences for meat quality would facilitate efficient use of feedlot pen space. The current experiment examined the impact on physiological variables and meat quality of regrouped British breed steers 4, 2 or 1 week before dispatch for slaughter. There was little effect of regrouping cattle on physiological variables associated with stress responses. Physical assessment of meat quality indicated that regrouping steers 1 week before slaughter led to higher compression and a tendency for higher peak force values in animals from one genotype than in their respective controls (1. 89 v. 1. 71 ± 0. 05 kg, P = 0. 017); however, these assessments were not matched by changes in sensory perception of meat quality.

A completely randomized design with three treatments and variable number of repetitions. The roughage:concentrate ratio from feedlot was 60 : 40. The lipid content of Longissimus dorsi muscle was influenced by the feeding system, the winter pasture showed higher lipid content in comparison to tropical pasture, while the lipid content of feedlot was intermediary. The tropical pasture showed intramuscular fat more saturated in relation to winter pasture, mainly due to the higher participation of C 15 : 0, C 17 : 0 and C 20 : 0 acids. The feedlot and winter pasture animals showed meat with higher content of monounsaturated fatty acids in relation to tropical pasture, but there was no effect of the diet on the total polyunsaturated fatty acids. The winter pasture provided meat with higher conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and of omega- 3 acids in relation to feedlot, while the tropical pasture did not differ from the other two treatments. Pasture finishing provided omega 6 /omega 3 ratio more benefic in relation to <b>feedlot</b> <b>finishing.</b> The winter pasture finishing provided meat with intramuscular fat more benefic in comparison to <b>feedlot</b> <b>finishing,</b> mainly due to higher CLA content, higher omega- 3 acids and lower omega- 6 /omega 3 ratio. Tropical pasture finishing resulted in meat with intermediate nutritional value between winter pasture and feedlot. ...|$|E
40|$|By-products {{from the}} dry-milling ethanol {{process can be}} used in cattle diets to replace corn. There is a {{significant}} interaction between corn processing methods as CCDS concentration increases in the diet. Improvements are observed for SFC in final BW, ADG, and G:F over DRC. An experiment was conducted to determine if greater concentrations of CCDS could be fed in SFC based diets and maintain or improve performance. Performance and carcass characteristics were evaluated with increasing concentrations of CCDS at 0, 9, 18, 27, or 36 % in place of SFC in <b>feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> diets. As CCDS concentration increased, DMI decreased quadratically. Gain increased quadratically with optimum inclusion calculated at 18. 2 % CCDS. A quadratic improvement was observed for G:F with optimum inclusion calculation at 24. 5 % CCDS. These results suggest feeding corn condensed distillers solubles can be used to replace SFC in <b>feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> diets while improving ADG and G:F. Monensin has been fed for over 35 years to improve G:F and prevent/control coccidiosis in feedlot cattle. Two experiments were conducted to determine if a difference exists between monensin rates of 360 or 480 mg/steer daily during the adaptation period. A significant interaction between treatment and experiment was observed for interim BW, ADG, and G:F during the adaptation period. During the adaptation period, cattle fed 360 mg/steer daily had greater ADG, increased interim BW, and improved G:F compared to steers fed 480 mg daily in Exp. 2. Carcass characteristics were not affected by monensin rate. This study suggests feeding 360 versus 480 mg/steer daily of monensin during the adaption period has little impact on overall performance of the cattle. Experiment 2 data indicate that 360 mg/steer daily of monensin may be more advantageous with the steers being more efficient during the adaptation period. However, they do not maintain that efficiency through the entire finishing period. Advisors: Matt K. Luebbe and Galen E. Erickso...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} risk and returns to cattle feeding in Alberta from the {{application}} of alternative marketing and pricing strategies. <b>Feedlot</b> <b>finishing</b> of 650 pound calves and 800 pound yearlings is modeled over the years from 1980 to 1993. The {{results of the study}} are based on the domestic and US marketing of live cattle using traditional cash marketing, futures contracts, put options, and forward production contracting systems. Use of the Western Domestic Feed Barley contract is also simulated. The results showed that barley price changes produced relatively small return changes compared to feeder and fat cattle price changes. An important source of return risk was found to be basis risk. Production contracting strategies which eliminated basis risk were found to provide the best returns in a market based risk-return comparison. The use of put options did not add value to cattle feeding investments. Demand and Price Analysis, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{feeding and}} management practices and possible feeding rations for summer grazing programs or for calves that are weaned and backgrounded before entering a <b>feedlot</b> for <b>finishing.</b> Reasons for Backgrounding Calves Backgrounding programs allow calves {{to grow and}} develop bone and muscle without becoming fleshy. Reasons for backgrounding weaned calves include: Calves can be retained rather than sold at weaning when prices are typically low. Developing replacement heifers. Allows producers to use inexpensive home-grown feeds, crop residues, and/or pasture to put weight on calves economically. Can add weight on small to medium framed calves or lightweight calves born late in the calving season before selling. Put minimal weight on calves during the winter before they graze on pasture the following spring and summer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions for rib eye area (REA), backfat thickness (BFT), and hot carcass weight (HCW) in Nellore beef cattle from Brazilian commercial herds using different prediction models. MethodsPhenotypic data from 1756 Nellore steers from ten commercial herds in Brazil were used. Animals were offspring of 294 sires and 1546 dams, reared on pasture, <b>feedlot</b> <b>finished,</b> and slaughtered at approximately 2  years of age. All animals were genotyped using a 777 k Illumina Bovine HD SNP chip. Accuracy of genomic predictions of breeding values was evaluated by using a 5 -fold cross-validation scheme and considering three models: Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), Bayes C (BC) and Bayesian Lasso (BL), and two types of response variables: traditional estimated breeding value (EBV), and phenotype adjusted for fixed effects (Y*). ResultsThe prediction accuracies achieved with the BRR model were equal to 0. 25 (BFT), 0. 33 (HCW) and 0. 36 (REA) when EBV was used as response variable, and 0. 21 (BFT), 0. 37 (HCW) and 0. 46 (REA) when using Y*. Results obtained with the BC and BL models were similar. Accuracies increased for traits with a higher heritability, and using Y* instead of EBV as response variable resulted in higher accuracy when heritability was higher. ConclusionsOur results indicate that the accuracy of genomic prediction of carcass traits in Nellore cattle is moderate to high. Prediction of genomic breeding values from adjusted phenotypes Y* was more accurate than from EBV, especially for highly heritable traits. The three models considered (BRR, BC and BL) led to similar predictive abilities and, thus, either one could be used to implement genomic prediction for carcass traits in Nellore cattle...|$|R

The {{number of animals}} by genetic group was, respectively, 15, 12, 8, 12, 14 and 9. Thirty-five males were castrated (C) at seven months and 35 were kept intact (1). The animals were <b>feedlot</b> <b>finished</b> from 20 to 24 months. The longissimus dorsi muscle {{was used for the}} meat evaluation. No significant interaction was observed between genetic composition and sexual condition, for the variables studied. The I males displayed meat with darker color (3. 05 vs. 3. 78 points) with less amount of marbling (4. 26 vs. 5. 75 points) and less amount of ether extract (1. 73 vs. 2. 88 %). However they presented larger (66. 03 vs. 60. 50 cm(2)) longissimus dorsi area and meat with better palatability, juiciness and tenderness. Ch animals had larger longissimus dorsi than the Ne. In the G I group, the 1 / 2 Ch meat showed larger amount of marbling and ether extract and less cooking losses than the 1 / 2 Ne meat. Between G 2 animals, the 3 / 4 Ne showed meat with larger thawing losses and larger amount of ether extract. In G 1 animals meat, the heterosis level reached 18. 54 % for longissimus dorsiarea, 28. 10 % for ether extract and 64. 01 % for amount of marbling. In G 2, the heterosis was - 17. 30 % for lean texture and 10. 40 % for longissimus dorsi area...|$|R
