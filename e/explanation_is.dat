5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that cats use grass as {{a source}} of folic acid.

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> {{that females}} might prefer {{brighter}} males, so sexual selection {{could result in}} aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E
5000|$|According to Dennett, {{the debate}} between Stalinesque and Orwellian <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> unresolvable [...] - [...] no amount of {{scientific}} information could ever answer the question. Dennett therefore argues (in accord with the philosophical doctrine of verificationism) that, since {{the differences between the}} two <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> unresolvable, the point of disagreement is logically meaningless so both <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> mistaken.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness.

40|$|Reconstructing <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> {{crucial for}} the {{progress}} of science. We focused on the transition of interest in a key fact that contradicts the preceding explanation and has {{a central role in}} its reconstruction. We used a short story as an experimental material in which the participants first constructed a naïve explanation and reconstructed it. First, when the naïve <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> rejected, a new <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> required, after interest in the key fact was inhibited. Second, hypothesized premises not inconsistent with the naïve <b>explanation</b> <b>were</b> sought to protect the naïve explanation. Third, interest in the key fact was recovered through the process of the explanation reconstruction. Last, we facilitated the explanation reconstruction by having the participants focus on the key fact...|$|R

5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E

5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology.

The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} two {{key aspects of}} young children's ability to explain human behaviour in a mentalistic way. First, we explored desires that are of a level of difficulty comparable with that of false beliefs. For this purpose, the so-called 'alternative desires' were created. Second, we examined how children's psychological <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> related to their understanding of perception and intention. A perception-understanding task, an intention-understanding task and a psychological-explanation task were administered to 80 three-year-olds. Results offer support for the thesis {{that the level of}} difficulty of belief and desire <b>explanations</b> <b>is</b> comparable. Moreover, children's psychological <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> related to their understanding of perception and intention. The results lend support to the idea that mentalistic <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> an explicit manifestation of children's level of theory of mind. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|To {{properly}} understand behavior, we must obtain both ultimate and proximate explanations. Put briefly, ultimate <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned with}} why a behavior exists, and proximate <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned with how}} it works. These two types of <b>explanation</b> <b>are</b> complementary and the distinction is critical to evolutionary <b>explanation.</b> We <b>are</b> concerned that they have become conflated {{in some areas of}} the evolutionary literature on human behavior. This article brings attention to these issues. We focus on three specific areas: he evolution of cooperation, transmitted culture, and epigenetics. We do this to avoid confusion and wasted effort-dangers that are particularly acute in interdisciplinary research. Throughout this article, we suggest ways in which misunderstanding may be avoided in the future. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
5|$|One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> the {{exposure}} of whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature.

The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E

5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey.

5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> the earldom hypothesis.
