50|$|Direct {{numerical}} control (DNC), {{also known as}} <b>distributed</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (also DNC), is a common manufacturing term for networking CNC machine tools. On some CNC machine controllers, the available memory {{is too small to}} contain the machining program (for example machining complex surfaces), so in this case the program is stored in a separate computer and sent directly to the machine, one block at a time. If the computer is connected to a number of machines it can distribute programs to different machines as required. Usually, the manufacturer of the control provides suitable DNC software. However, if this provision is not possible, some software companies provide DNC applications that fulfill the purpose. DNC networking or DNC communication is always required when CAM programs are to run on some CNC machine control.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our {{case study of}} designing an FIP-based <b>distributed</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system, focusing on practically validating the end-to-enddesign methodology that we have developed in [10, 11]. The design methodology was used to automatically derive task attributes such as periods, deadlines, and phases, from the high-level design of the numerical control system. Since the design methodology was developed under a number of simplifying and generalizing assumptions, we had to customize it during the case study, taking into account practical {{issues such as the}} clock synchronization and the network scheduling of FIP. In doing so, we also developed a new and improved deadline decomposition algorithm to increase the chances of producing schedulable timing constraints. We have fully implemented the <b>distributed</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system on top of the ARX real-time operating system that we have built, and performed extensive experiments by generating a controlled series of dozens of numerical controllers. These experiments clearly show that the proposed deadline decomposition algorithm outperforms existing ones, and that the end-to-end design method can be effectively applied to the design of highly predictable industrial real-time systems, if it is properly customized for the given hardware and software platform. ...|$|E

40|$|Since its inception, numerically {{controlled}} (NC) machining {{methods have been}} used throughout the aerospace industry to mill, drill, and turn complex shapes by sequentially stepping through motion programs. However, the recent demand for more precision, faster feeds, exotic sensors, and branching execution have existing computer numerical control (CNC) and <b>distributed</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> (DNC) systems running at maximum controller capacity. Typical disadvantages of current CNC's include fixed memory capacities, limited communication ports, {{and the use of}} multiple control languages. The need to tailor CNC's to meet specific applications, whether it be expanded memory, additional communications, or integrated vision, often requires replacing the original controller supplied with the commercial machine tool with a more powerful and capable system. This paper briefly describes the process and equipment requirements for new controllers and their evolutionary implementation in an aerospace environment. The process of controller retrofit with currently available machines is examined, along with several case studies and their computational and architectural implications...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with identifying the problems and constraints faced by small batch manufacturing companies during the implementation of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). The main aim of this work is to recommend generic solutions to these problems with particular regard to those constraints arising {{because of the need}} for ClM systems integration involving both new and existing systems and procedures. The work has involved the application of modern computer technologies, including suitable hardware and software tools, in an industrial environment. Since the research has been undertaken with particular emphasis on the industrial implementor's viewpoint, it is supported by the results of a two phased implementation of computer based control systems within the machine shop of a manufacturing company. This involved the specific implementation of a <b>Distributed</b> <b>Numerical</b> <b>Control</b> system on a single machine in a group technology cell of machines followed by the evolution of this system into Cell and Machine Management Systems to provide a comprehensive decision support and information distribution facility for the foremen and uperators within the cell. The work also required the integration of these systems with existing Factory level manufacturing control and CADCAM functions. Alternative approaches have been investigated which may have been applicable under differing conditions and the implications that this specific work has for CIM systems integration in small batch manufacturing companies evaluated with regard not only to the users within an industrial company but also the systems suppliers external to the company. The work has resulted in certain generic contributions to knowledge by complementing ClM systems integration research with regard to problems encountered; cost implications; the use of appropriate methodologies including the role of emerging international standard methods, tools and technologies and also the importance of 'human integration' when implementing CIM systems in a real industrial situation...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines and also from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machine activities and interpret/represent process information within computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R
