5000|$|During the 1950s, the American Institute of Architects in Florida was a {{powerful}} and prestigious organization. They would not allow AIA members to be employed by a contractor who offered design/build services, which made architect recruitment more difficult.

Describing the tagline as [...] "significant", Preston Haskell stated:“This {{was the first time}} the company was identified as an integrated, in-house design-build firm practicing all three disciplines. It coincided with enactment by the Florida Legislature of legislation allowing the practice of architecture by a corporation.” [...] Throughout his entire career, Haskell used and promoted the integrated <b>Design-Build</b> <b>method</b> of construction, but faced widespread opposition to what was classified as a non-traditional method.

40|$|CIVINSThough many of {{the legal}} issues that may be {{encountered}} using the <b>design-build</b> <b>method</b> of project delivery are the same or similar to legal issues encountered using other methods of project delivery, there are several issues unique to design-build which can significantly affect {{the success of the}} project and the parties involved in the design-build project. Differences in issues such as liability, insurance coverage, bonding, public procurement requirements and statutes, licensing, and changes in responsibilities and expectations of the contracting parties can lead to unexpected problems, conflict, and litigation.

This paper builds on earlier work and investigates the barriers that impede {{the use of the}} <b>design-build</b> procurement <b>method</b> in the construction industry. After a comprehensive literature survey, an empirical study was conducted in the Hong Kong construction industry by means of a questionnaire survey. The top- 3 barriers to the implementation of D&B were 'D&B contractors carry a high degree of risks and liability', 'The Contractor tendering for the D&B project will suffer greatly if the contract is not awarded to him', and 'D&B contractors do not have in-house architects and engineers'. Both intra-group and inter-group comparisons were conducted to determine the level of agreement of the D&B participants on the rating exercise. Results show that there is significant agreement among the respondents in each of the client, contractor and consultant groups, and also among all D&B participants on the rating of the problems of running D&B projects. This research provides an understanding of the barriers to the adoption to the D&B development in the Asia, despite its widespread use {{in other parts of the}} world.

Findings – The theoretical basis of this research lies in the brazilian legislation for contracting works and studies conducted by various authors in which address the advantages of design-build procurement method (a single contract for design and construction) regarding the design-bid-build method used in Brazil, which hires design and construction separately. Practical implications – The research identified advantages, disadvantages and risks associated to the adoption of the <b>design-build</b> <b>method,</b> enabling the development of coping strategies if it is deployed.

40|$|Design-Build (DB) {{system has}} been widely adopted {{overseas}} {{but it has not}} received the same popularity yet in the People’s Republic of China. The selection of design-build variant is {{regarded as one of the}} critical obstacles to the application of this alternative. This paper investigates categories of design-build variants in the construction market of China. The develop-and-construction, enhanced design-build, traditional-design-build and engineering procurement-construction (EPC) are the four current designbuild variants adopted by clients. Each of them is developed to meet a varying set of circumstances and has its own advantages and disadvantages. The develop-and-construction is mostly used in large, complex projects in housing industry and it will guarantee client’s great control over the project while still leave some design room for the contractor. The traditional-design-build and enhanced-design-build systems are mostly applied in projects that are comparatively simple, small-scale, and the DB contractors will have greater control of the projects. The EPC is the extension of pure <b>design-build</b> <b>method</b> and is widely adopted in the petrochemical, metallurgical and electronic fields because of the high-technique requirements and the necessity for one entity to control the design, construction, procurement and commissioning etc. Four corresponding design-build projects are also presented in this paper in order to better illustrate the operational process and provide the insight for understanding the design-build variants in Mainland China...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the delegation of contracting capacity in a moral hazard environment with sequential production {{in a project}} which involves a principal and two agents. The {{agent in charge of}} the …nal production can obtain soft information about the other agent's effort choice by investing in monitoring. I investigate the circumstances under which it is optimal for the principal to use a centralized organization in which she designs the contracts with both agents or to use a decentralized organization in which she contracts only one agent, and delegates the power to contract the other agent. It is shown that in this setting a decentralized organization can be superior to a centralized organization. This is because the principal is better off under monitoring and the incentives for an agent to invest in monitoring can be higher in a decentralized organization. The circumstances under which this is true are related to the monitoring costs and the importance of each agent for production. The results explain the recent application of the <b>design-build</b> <b>method</b> in public procurement. Journal of Economic Literature Classi…cation Numbers: D 23, D 82, L 14, L 22.

40|$|Process {{innovation}} {{related to}} integrated project delivery {{is an important}} topic in the building industry. Studies on process innovation {{through the use of}} integrated contracts usually focus on contractors, and particularly on the possibility of forward integration into the building process. Three years ago, the first author investigated the process innovation capabilities of architectural firms by using the concept of system integration. This led to the idea that architects could take on the leading role in design-build contracts. Based on the results of that study, the conclusion was drawn that architects certainly have opportunities to act as a system integrator in the building process. By broadening their activities, architects can reclaim their central position, in which design and managerial skills can be combined. As a result of this promising view, a major client (a Dutch school board with a number of schools under its jurisdiction) and an architectural firm decided to develop a new concept. Together with the authors they developed the organisational and juridical aspects of the concept into a designer-led <b>design-build</b> <b>method</b> and implemented it in practice: the design and realisation of school buildings. Two projects were intensively monitored. It turned out that the concept has a lot of advantages for both the client and the architectural firm.
