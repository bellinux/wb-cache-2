[...] "They {{turned him}} loose on the trail when they'd done with him, and that's all there is to it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is what they've done with Tillicum. One thing's certain. If he doesn't turn up, your father's going to be mighty mad." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a [...] "C-", stating [...] "... tonight's classically themed outing didn't fare very well, {{starting}} {{with the story of}} one of the Bouvier sisters as Queen Elizabeth—an episode segment that clocked in at just over four minutes, far too short a time to do anything lasting... or funny. The longest stretch came near the end, {{in the form of an}} extended riff on MacBeth involving Homer killing a ton of people. But aside from the occasional random line or two, it was pretty much a boring retelling of the tale, with Simpsons characters subbing in for Shakespearean ones. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is: How much pleasure is there to milk from seeing familiar yellow people reenact parts of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead? Given the show's shaky streak lately, not nearly enough." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 6.2/10, ultimately saying [...] "Four stories instead of three, but there was really one worth watching." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with David Shrigley, Monk says: [...] "Is it or is it not or can it or can it not be? This {{is something that has}} been dealt with within the art world for some time and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> unanswerable <b>question</b> keeps us all going..." ...|$|R
6000|$|Whitwell {{smiled with}} {{pleasure}} in the loosely philosophic suggestion. [...] "You mean that he's {{the same kind of}} a man that he was a boy? Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's so. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is, what kind of a boy was he? I've been mullin' over that consid'able since Cynthy and him fixed it up together. Of course, I know it's their business, and all that; but I presume I've got a right to spee'late about it?" ...|$|R
50|$|So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{best thing}} <b>I</b> can do, {{is just to}} cut and run.|$|R
60|$|Or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{grass is}} itself a child, the {{produced}} babe of the vegetation.|$|R
60|$|But {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>the</b> {{identity of}} the mighty creature as Elephas africanus, or, as the ancients commonly described it, African elephant.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> by <b>the</b> dear angel smile, [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> by <b>the</b> love-rolling e'e; [...] But why {{urge the}} tender confession, [...] 'Gainst Fortune's fell, cruel decree?--Jessy. [...] Here's a health, &c.|$|R
6000|$|... "He came well recommended, that's why," [...] {{answered}} Songbird. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> captain {{has found}} out that the recommendation was false." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy grinned. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{way that}} dam will grow will astonish {{you when you}} come back again. Where're you going to?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{people in}} the next rooms must have thought there was {{something}} of a rumpus in our room when I caught him.|$|R
6000|$|Tomlinson nodded. [...] "That's the {{straight}} thing, Major," [...] he said. [...] "Keep him right there. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> insect's {{at the bottom}} of everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he knows}} what to do, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>The</b> moment he starts in to make those houses decent, the {{articles}} stop. It's up to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If those Germans try any {{of their}} monkey tricks on us, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> United States will give them hell," [...] said another voice near by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Up on Adeline, near Tenth--fine {{neighborhood}} an' fine two-storied house. He {{must pay}} thirty {{dollars a month}} rent. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> railroad paid him pretty well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> cadets of Colby Hall can yell, too," [...] responded Fred. And he was right, for {{a moment}} later there boomed out this refrain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confusion to you! In {{another hour}} I'd have been {{rustling}} for the Great Republic. Still, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> game's up. Don't be a mule, Fletcher; I'm going quietly." ...|$|R
60|$|AMERICAN. I {{think you}} are very likely right, colonel. It might be a pity to unbind that baby. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> lady should be {{consulted}} in this matter.|$|R
6000|$|He got off, {{and as the}} {{conductor}} started up the car, he called forward through it to the driver, [...] "Wanted to try for conductor, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> seventy-five dollars capital settled that little point for him." ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR MR. ROGERS,--Yours of Dec. 21 has arrived, {{containing}} the circular to stockholders and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> Co. will really quit--there doesn't {{seem to be}} any other wise course.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{work for}} the Souvenir and Art Novelty Company on Twenty-eighth Street. If {{you want to call}} them up <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> manager'll give me a pretty good recommend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{think about}} it, when I held you up I felt {{something}} give. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> buckle was pulling out. Well, {{we ought to}} see the brown leather." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> tumble {{must have}} hurt some," [...] {{announced}} Randy. [...] "Look at those footprints further on, will you? One of the fellows {{did a lot}} of limping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it was my fault," [...] he said. [...] "The beast {{stumbled}} and almost jerked me over. Then <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> bridle either broke or pulled out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] said John, deeply interested, [...] "is getting exciting. Don't give in, Pugsy. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{trouble is}} that your too perfect Italian accent is making the kid homesick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't know as she is; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{same kind}} of handlin' will fetch her 'round all right in the long run. Can't you eat some peanuts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so fast." [...] The Kid smiled curiously. [...] "We ain't {{under way}} yet. When I go I'm going down river, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> chances are you'll go along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A raccoon, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> {{or a big}} woodchuck. Won't his fur make a fine cap? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> other fellows will wish they'd {{come with}} us," [...] said Tommy, prancing to and fro, without the least {{idea what to do}} with the creature.|$|R
3000|$|... …So, there’s that {{self-isolation}} {{and then}} it gets {{to a point where}} <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> collective might just …not even invite anymore, because they know this person may not come along.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't they crosspatches?" [...] said Poppy to her doll. [...] "Never mind, dear: {{you shall}} hang out, if <b>I</b> can't. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> old man won't order you in, any way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} one I've got," [...] he said to Kinnaird. [...] "Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> thing will dry, and I've had a sail that has made me feel young again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's a clew, {{even if it}} is {{a slight}} one," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "Dick, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{best thing you can do}} is to call up police headquarters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' please, master," [...] put in Jacques, [...] "when do {{you mean}} to let us off from this place? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> bourgeois won't be over pleased if we waste time here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they ought}} to be evenly balanced," [...] said the boy, [...] "and I had no time to be careful. From the way you're acting, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> dose was badly mixed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a fine thing," [...] {{declared}} Aunt Em, admiringly. [...] "If we'd {{had it in}} Kansas <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> man {{who held}} a mortgage on the farm wouldn't have turned us out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> {{best we can}} do is to {{look out}} for our little end," [...] smiled the boy. [...] "As for the rest, the {{authorities}} at Washington must settle that." ...|$|R
