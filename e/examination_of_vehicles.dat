40|$|June 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 12) Rear-end collisions predominantly {{occur in}} the daytime under clear, unobstructed viewing conditions and usually involve a lead vehicle that is stopped {{at the time of}} collision. These facts suggest that driver inattention plays a significant causal role in rear-end collisions, and mitigation efforts have therefore focused largely on development of warning technologies to alert drivers of an impending crash. However, we note that this pattern of crash data should not lead to the conclusion that drivers have special difficulty avoiding rear-end collisions in broad daylight. Nor should it be concluded that other “environmental” factors do not influence driving behavior to increase rear-end crash risk. Crash frequency is determined both by the inherent risk in the driving task and by the frequency of driver exposure to conditions in which a crash is possible. When exposure level is equated across conditions which differ in ambient light level, we find that rear-end collisions appear to be {{more than twice as likely}} in darkness as in daylight, and are more influenced by light level than are either side-impact collisions or front-end collisions.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe {{automotive}} industry is repeatedly tasked with improving vehicles structural strength, optimizing active and passive safety features, reducing occupant injury potential, and hitting lean manufacturing goals. The {{challenge is to}} find solutions to reduce production and research costs, and to maximize the vehicle's capability in protecting its occupants {{in the event of}} an accident. The influence of impact loading on the dynamic responses <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> structures and occupants require special consideration in the field <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> crashworthiness. The main goal of this study is to address the fundamental aspect on the impact injury biomechanics <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> occupants and safety performance <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> structures, and the development of various new technologies aimed at enhancing the passive safety <b>of</b> road <b>vehicles</b> in side-impact accidents. Four case studies related to the dissipation of crash energy, impact injury biomechanics, injury prediction model and pre-crash sensing algorithm form the basis of this thesis. The application examples include the investigation of pre-deploying airbags as a potential solution in reducing occupants' injuries at higher speed side-impact crashes; <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle</b> structural responses with the inclusion of high-energy absorbing cellular materials within the door panels in side-impact accidents; development of injury prediction model to out-of-position occupants from frontal- and side- airbags using Design-of-Experiment methodologies; and the estimation of the relative driver fatality risks <b>of</b> two colliding <b>vehicles</b> using some quantitative measurements.

40|$|Lane {{changing}} manoeuvres have {{a substantial}} impact on microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics due to the interference effect they have on surrounding vehicles. The interference effects of heavy vehicles’ lane changing manoeuvres on surrounding traffic {{are likely to be}} greater than when passenger cars execute lane changing manoeuvre. While heavy vehicles account for a minority of traffic stream, heavy vehicles have a pronounced effect on traffic flow and produce a disproportionate effect particularly during heavy traffic conditions. Heavy vehicles impose physical and psychological effects on surrounding traffic which are the results of physical and operational characteristics <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicles.</b> The number <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicles</b> on urban freeways has increased {{over the past three decades}} and this trend is likely to continue over the next decade. Despite the increasing number <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicles</b> on freeways, previous studies have predominantly focused on the behaviour of passenger car drivers. In the previous lane changing models, heavy vehicles are accommodated in current lane changing models by calibrating the parameters of a general lane changing model for heavy vehicles rather than by incorporating a lane changing model developed specifically for the heavy vehicle drivers. However, heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers may have fundamentally different lane changing behaviour. In this study, the trajectory dataset is based on the video images of two freeway sections. In general, extracting the trajectory dataset from video images makes it impossible to capture some physical (e. g. weight) and operational (e. g. power) characteristics <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The length <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> is one <b>of</b> their physical characteristics that can be extracted from video images. Therefore, vehicle length is used to identify heavy vehicles in this research. The vehicles with the length of equal to or greater than 6 meters are classified as heavy vehicles. This classification is consistent with the definition <b>of</b> the heavy <b>vehicles</b> in the trajectory dataset used for this study. In this research, the lane changing behaviour of a driver has been characterized as a sequence of three stages including motivation to change lanes, selection of the target lane and the execution of the lane change. This research has provided new insight into the role that traffic parameters associated with the surrounding vehicles plays in the lane changing behaviour <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> and passenger car drivers. From detailed <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> trajectory data, differences were identified in the lane changing <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> and passenger car drivers in terms of the three stages of lane changing behaviour. To understand the influencing factors on heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing, it is required to analyse the surrounding traffic characteristics at the time that the heavy vehicle drives change lanes as well as when they do not wish to execute lane changing manoeuvre. From detailed <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding traffic characteristics, the explanatory variables in heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing decision were identified. A reliable model has been developed in this thesis to estimate the lane changing behaviour <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers. Drivers’ lane changing behaviour has been characterised as a sequence of two stages: the decision to change lanes and the execution of the lane change. Hence, separate models were considered for those two stages <b>of</b> the heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers’ lane changing behaviour. Fuzzy logic was used to develop a model of the lane changing decision <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers. The lane changing decision has been defined as the motivation for selecting either the right adjacent lane (slower lane) or the left adjacent lane (faster lane). Therefore, two separate models were developed for the lane changing decision <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers: Lane Changing to Slower Lane (LCSL) and Lane Changing to Faster Lane (LCFL). The explanatory variables in motivating heavy vehicle drivers to move into the slower lane include: the front space gap, the rear space gap, the lag space gap in the right lane and the average speed <b>of</b> the surrounding <b>vehicles</b> in the current lane. The explanatory variables in motivating heavy vehicle drivers to move into the faster lane include: the front relative speed, the lag relative speed in the left lane and the average speeds <b>of</b> the surrounding <b>vehicles</b> in the current lane and the left lane. A triangular membership function was used for all fuzzy sets in the lane changing decision model. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to examine the accuracy of the models in estimating the lane changing manoeuvres <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers. The obtained results showed that the LCFL model has higher percentage of accurately estimating the heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing decision. This may be due to the fact that heavy vehicle drivers mainly move into the faster lane to gain speed advantages which could be modelled by the microscopic traffic characteristics <b>of</b> surrounding <b>vehicles</b> in the current and the left lanes. However, the heavy vehicle drivers may have other motivations for moving into the slower lane than only the differences in microscopic traffic characteristics in the current and the right lanes. The speed and acceleration/deceleration profiles <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicles</b> were analysed in detail from the start to the end of lane changing manoeuvres. The results showed that heavy vehicle drivers maintain an almost constant speed during lane changing execution. They do not accelerate or decelerate to adjust their speed according to the speeds <b>of</b> the surrounding <b>vehicles</b> in the target lane. Subsequently, a simple constant speed model could be assumed for the heavy vehicles during the lane changing execution. Finally, the performance <b>of</b> the heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers’ lane changing model was examined macroscopically and microscopically using VISSIM (German abbreviation for ‘traffic simulation in cities’) microscopic traffic simulation model. The heavy vehicle lane changing model in VISSIM was substituted with a combination of the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane changing decision model and a constant speed lane changing execution model. The traffic measurements obtained from the fuzzy logic model were compared to those obtained from a calibrated VISSIM lane changing model and the actual field observations. The results show that using the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane changing model provided more accurate estimates of the macroscopic traffic measurements. The number <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicle</b> lane changing manoeuvres estimated by the fuzzy logic model was found to be more accurate than the estimates from default lane changing model in VISSIM. The microscopic analysis of the lane changing manoeuvres shows that using the fuzzy logic model more accurately replicated the microscopic lane changing behaviour <b>of</b> the heavy <b>vehicle</b> drivers. In particular, the fuzzy logic model accurately replicates the observed speed profile <b>of</b> heavy <b>vehicles</b> and the observed space gap and speed profiles <b>of</b> the surrounding <b>vehicles</b> during lane changing manoeuvres. The superior performance of the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle drivers’ lane changing model highlights the importance of developing an exclusive lane changing model for heavy vehicle drivers. Employing a purpose built heavy vehicle lane changing model has been shown to increase the accuracy of the microscopic traffic simulation model...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle choice {{decisions}} are Important to consider {{because they have}} implications on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Much {{research has been done}} in the past regarding the types <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> that people own and how much they use each vehicle on annual basis. However, these are all long-term vehicle choice decision, and very little research has been done to explore short-term decisions. Short-term decisions provide information about how much vehicles in the household are being used at a day-level. In addition to the capturing the role of socio-demographics and economic factors on the short-term vehicle choices, the fine scale temporal analysis allows for exploring the relationship between vehicle choices and daily activity-travel engagement decisions which shape the selection and use <b>of</b> different <b>vehicles</b> in the household fleet. In the context <b>of</b> the short-term <b>vehicle</b> choices, there are two important choices to consider: the vehicle chosen from the household fleet to pursue the trip and the distance traveled. Further, there are important interrelationships between these two variables namely, vehicle choice may affect distance or distance may affect vehicle choice. Depending on the directionality of this relationship, there are different policy implications. It is important to understand these short-term decisions and their interrelationships so as to make informed decisions for creating efficient transportation systems, reducing fuel use, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. To explore the relationship between distance and vehicle type, data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) was used. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, findings from the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> distance and <b>vehicle</b> type choice dimensions are presented. This section also explores the potential interrelationships between the choice dimensions. Further, the section also discusses findings from a comparative analysis <b>of</b> differences in <b>vehicle</b> choice behaviors across three metropolitan areas namely New York, Los Angeles, and Washington. The second part of the thesis explored the possibility that not one but both interdependencies could hold true but each for a different subgroup of the population to explain the short-term vehicle choice and usage behaviors. To this end, a latent segmentation approach was used to model both interdependencies and the corresponding interrelationships between vehicle type choice and distance within the same modeling framework. Both studies provide statistically significant and plausible results. Further, the results provide evidence in support of the importance <b>of</b> short-term <b>vehicle</b> choices and the importance of them in planning and policy analysis...|$|R
