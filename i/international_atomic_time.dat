25|$|However, for {{the past}} several centuries, the length of the mean solar day has been {{increasing}} by about 1.4–1.7 ms per century, depending on the averaging time. By 1961, the mean solar day was already a millisecond or two longer than 86,400 SI seconds. Therefore, time standards that change the date after precisely 86,400 SI seconds, such as the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> (TAI), will get increasingly ahead of time standards tied to the mean solar day, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other time}} scale has two parts.

With the introduction of atomic clocks in the 1950s, it was found that ET could be better realized as atomic time. This also means that ET is a uniform time scale, as is atomic time. ET was given a new name, Terrestrial Time (TT), and for most purposes ET = TT = <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Time</b> + 32.184 SI seconds.
