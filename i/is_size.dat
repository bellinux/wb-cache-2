Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E

2500|$|Efficiency of duplex {{sequencing}} {{depends on}} final number of DCSs which {{is directly related}} to number of reads in each family (family size). If the family size is too small then the DCS can not be assembled and if too many reads are sharing the same tag the data yield will be low. Family size is determined by the amount of DNA template for PCR amplification and dedicated sequencing lane fraction. The optimal tag family size is between 6 and 12 members. To obtain the optimal family size the amount of DNA template and dedicated sequencing lane fraction needs to be adjusted. The following formula takes into account the most important variables that can affect depth of coverage (N=40DG÷R) where [...] "N" [...] is number of reads, [...] "D" [...] is desired depth of coverage, [...] "G" [...] <b>is</b> <b>size</b> of DNA target in basepair and [...] "R" [...] is final read length.|$|E
2500|$|Nanotechnology ("nanotech") is [...] {{manipulation}} of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology [...] {{referred to the}} particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the {{manipulation of}} matter {{with at least one}} dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form [...] "nanotechnologies" [...] as well as [...] "nanoscale technologies" [...] to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait <b>is</b> <b>size.</b> Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research.
