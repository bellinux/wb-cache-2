2500|$|Fowler–Nordheim {{tunneling}} is the wave-mechanical tunneling of {{an electron}} through an exact or rounded triangular barrier. Two basic situations are recognized: (1) when the electron is initially in a localized state; (2) when the electron is initially not strongly localized, and is best {{represented by a}} travelling wave. Emission from a bulk metal conduction band is a situation of the second type, and <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> relates to this case. It is also assumed that the barrier is one-dimensional (i.e., has no lateral structure), and has no fine-scale structure that causes [...] "scattering" [...] or [...] "resonance" [...] effects. To keep this explanation of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling relatively simple, these assumptions are needed; but the atomic structure of matter is in effect being disregarded.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{epidemiology}} in documenting the mortality experience in complex emergencies has become pervasive in humanitarian practice. Recent assessments in Iraq and Darfur have provoked much {{discussion on the}} assessment of mortality in scientific and policy spheres. In this context, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative held an inter-disciplinary symposium to examine the topic among epidemiologists, demographers, forensic scientists and legal and human rights investigators. We aimed to strengthen the scientific understanding of mortality estimation by reviewing progress across fields and building inter-disciplinary bridges.

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal physical product of labor. More importantly for the <b>discussion</b> <b>here,</b> the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal physical product of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Judaism, the Oral Law {{must have been}} disseminated {{at the same time}} as the Written Torah because certain Torah commandments would be indecipherable without a separate explanatory codex and, presumably, God would not demand adherence to commandments that could not be understood. Many terms used in the Torah are left undefined, such as the word totafot, usually translated as [...] "frontlets," [...] which is used three times in the Pentateuch (in Exodus 13:9 and Deuteronomy 6:8 and 11:18) but only identified with tefillin in the Mishnah (see Menachot 3:7). Similarly, many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions, or assume familiarity on the part of the reader. For example, the discussion of shechita (kosher slaughter) in Deuteronomy 12 states [...] "you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God Lord has given you, as I have commanded you," [...] without any clear indication of what had been [...] "commanded"; only in the Oral Torah are the various requirements of ritual slaughter explicated. Similarly, Deuteronomy 24 discusses the laws of divorce in passing; these laws are set forth with great specificity in the Mishnah and Gemara. Also, the blue string of tekhelet on the tzitzit is to be dyed with a dye extracted from what some scholars believe to be a snail is a detail only spoken of in the oral Torah.

In all cases, interactions are derived from the chiral dynamics of the light flavor sector. These interactions generate in various cases hadronic composite/molecule states, serving varieties of structure beyond the conventional quark model...|$|R

40|$|The role of ArfGAP 1 as a {{terminator}} or effector in COPi-vesicle formation {{has been}} the subject of ongoing <b>discussions.</b> <b>Here,</b> the <b>discussion</b> on the putative terminator/effector functions has been enlarged to include Arf GAP members involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. ACAP 1, whose role has been studied extensively, enhances the recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma membrane. Importantly, this positive role appears to be an overall reflection of both the terminator and effector activities attributed to ACAP 1. Other Arf GAP subtypes have also been suggested to possess both terminator and effector activities. Interestingly, while most Arf GAP proteins regulate membrane trafficking by acting as facilitators, a few Arf GAP subtypes act as inhibitors...|$|R

Agents are evolved for categorical perception, a minimal cognitive task, and must correlate approaching or avoiding movements based on (two) different types of objects. Results indicate a significant tendency to better behaviouralrobustness by monostable in contrast to bistable agents {{in the presence of}} sensorimotor, mutational, and structural perturbations. <b>Discussions</b> <b>here</b> focus on a further dependence to coupled dynamics by the former agents to explain such a tendency...|$|R
40|$|Responses of a spherical or {{elliptical}} {{earth to}} external or surface forces are usually studied by expanding the {{equations of motion}} in spherical-harmonic functions.

The <b>discussions</b> <b>here</b> on the divergence at high degrees tell us that some problems (such as surface load and shear forces) could not be solved by using harmonic expansion, and prevent us from solving the problems by the same means again.
