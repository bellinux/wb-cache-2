However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E

25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required.

People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
25|$|Further {{conflict}} and a siege in 1646 caused untold {{damage to the}} city. With the choir disbanded and the cathedral closed, Tomkins turned his <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> the composition {{of some of his}} finest keyboard and consort music; in 1647, he wrote a belated tombeau or tribute to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and a further one to the memory of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, both beheaded in 1641, and both admired by Tomkins. Charles I was executed in 1649, and a few days later Tomkins, always a royalist, composed his superb Sad Pavan: for these distracted times. His second wife Martha died around 1653, and deprived of his living, Tomkins, now 81, was in serious financial difficulties. In 1654 his son Nathaniel married Isabella Folliott, a wealthy widow, and Thomas went to live with them in Martin Hussingtree, some four miles from Worcester. He expressed his gratitude by composing his Galliard, The Lady Folliot's in her honour. Two years later he died and was buried in the churchyard of Martin Hussingtree on 9 June 1656.|$|E

Reinhard Schuetze was the city's first landscape architect, and he brought his German-educated landscaping <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> Washington Park, Cheesman Park, and City Park among others.

500|$|Bobby Orr {{displayed}} his hockey talents from {{an early}} age. Orr played his first organized hockey in 1953 at age five, in the [...] "minor squirt" [...] division, a year after getting his first skates and playing shinny. Although he was tiny and somewhat frail, he soon was able to skate faster than anyone his own age, speed he demonstrated in races around the rink and in games. Until he was ten years old, Orr played on the wing, as a forward. His coach, former NHL player Bucko McDonald moved Orr to defence. Although Orr played defence, McDonald encouraged Orr to use his talents as a stickhandler, skater and scorer to make offensive rushes. According to McDonald: [...] "I used to tell Doug the kid was in his natural position when he played defence. You didn't have to be <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> see that – honest. I don't think Doug agreed, but he accepted my decision." [...] Orr would later credit McDonald: [...] "Bucko taught me almost everything I know." ...|$|E
500|$|The writer Friedrich Schiller (four {{of whose}} plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) {{distinguished}} {{two types of}} artist in his 1795 essay On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'naïve' category—"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have <b>genius,</b> <b>to</b> embody their vision fully." [...] (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms—Berlin instances Wagner—"offering not peace, but a sword.") Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst [...] "there was much to be admired in [...] Tannhäuser and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [...] seemed to be overstepping the bounds {{of what can be}} expressed in [...] music. For him [...] "philosophical" [...] music was incomprehensible." [...] Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits [...] "to the most artificial of genres... ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so." ...|$|E

In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, {{has much to do with}} Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{philosophy}} of Bertrand Russell, genius entails that an individual possesses unique qualities and talents that make the <b>genius</b> especially valuable <b>to</b> the society in {{which he or she}} operates, once given the chance to contribute to society.

500|$|The primary {{antagonist}} of {{the novel}} is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland; Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks the scarred villain to be [...] "an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula". Some writers were unimpressed with Breed; Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thought that the character [...] "feels more like a henchman than a proper power-crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. You wait for the evil <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> turn up—but he never does", while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard wrote that the character [...] "lacks charisma", and David Connett in the Sunday Express considered him [...] "a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts". The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed, writing that Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains; Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, [...] "motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous". There are two main female characters in Solo— horror film actress Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant; like many of Fleming's female characters, both are [...] "determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond".|$|E
500|$|Several {{well-known}} {{directors have}} praised City Lights. Orson Welles {{said it was}} his favorite film. In a 1963 interview in the American magazine Cinema, Stanley Kubrick rated City Lights as fifth among his top ten films. In 1972, the renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky placed City Lights as fifth among his top ten and said of Chaplin, [...] "He {{is the only person}} to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old." [...] George Bernard Shaw called Chaplin [...] "the only <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> come out of the movie industry". Celebrated Italian director Federico Fellini often praised this film, and his Nights of Cabiria refers to it. In the 2003 documentary Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin, Woody Allen said it was Chaplin's best picture. Allen is said to have based the final scene of his 1979 film Manhattan on its final scene. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has summarized all the best criticism and all the notable filmmakers who have singled out City Lights as their favorite Chaplin film throughout the decades in the Criterion Collection audio commentary track for the film. Vance has written that among all the praise afforded the film can be added that [...] "City Lights also holds the distinction of being Chaplin's own favorite of all his films." ...|$|E
500|$|After The Grand Duke, the {{partners}} {{saw no reason}} to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer. They did not speak to each other. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been [...] "completely bridged over," [...] and [...] "the most cordial relations existed between us." [...] He stated that [...] "Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his <b>genius</b> <b>to</b> shed some of its lustre upon my humble name." ...|$|E
