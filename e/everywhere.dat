This drift is not the same <b>everywhere</b> and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.|$|E

5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) {{are defined by}} some property that holds for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative <b>everywhere,</b> and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners <b>everywhere,</b> with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E

In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an artificial mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– {{was the most common}} form of castle in Europe, <b>everywhere</b> except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E

5|$|English {{language}} {{learning and teaching}} is an important economic activity, and includes language schooling, tourism spending, and publishing. There is no legislation mandating an official language for England, but English is the only language used for official business.

5|$|Even {{once the}} mysteries were established, {{they were not}} {{performed}} <b>everywhere</b> Isis's cult was present. The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis, {{and it is not}} certain that they were ever performed there.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential <b>everywhere.</b> This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found <b>everywhere</b> in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} ambitious and {{promising}} of the young princes of the Kamehameha realm.

The glance of his eyes made him friends <b>everywhere.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either {{we are at}} the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding <b>everywhere.</b> This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} <b>everywhere,</b> though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E

Her mom accompanied her <b>everywhere</b> until she turned 18. Her parents have since moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although {{a limited number}} of visitors hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area and inexperienced hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness.

The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E
5|$|Number {{names are}} {{rendered}} {{in the language}} of the country, but are similar <b>everywhere</b> due to shared etymology. Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, for example the Indian numbering system.|$|E
5|$|One day Al•Ith enters Zone Two {{and does}} not return. But the changes {{set in motion by}} the two marriages are now evident <b>everywhere.</b> The frontiers between Zones Three, Four and Five are open, and people and {{knowledge}} are flowing between them. Previously stagnant, the three Zones are now filled with enquiry, inspiration and renewal.|$|E
