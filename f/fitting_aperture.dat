The analysis {{does not take into}} account the viscosity of the medium nor any other deviation from its 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 behavior. Numerical calculations are not given. Attention is paid mainly to the mathematical formalism. In section 1 the problem is mathematically stated by means of the velocity potential in the form of a boundary value problem in connection with the wave equation. A new argument is given as to why the time factor exp (-iwt) is preferred in theoretical considerations. Section 2 contains a brief sketch of the derivation of the now already classical Rayleigh formula, together with some critical remarks. Section 3 is devoted to energy considerations. The definitions of acoustic impedance and radiation characteristic are given. In addition formulae are derived by means of which they can be computed in the case of any prescribed source distribution. In section 4 the general formulae are applied to a circular membrane, oscillating with azimuthal and radial nodal lines. In section 5 King's theory of the circular disc oscillating with uniform amplitude is very much extended. The theory can be developed in terms of cylindrical wave functions. It is possible to express the velocity potential as a definite integral involving Bessel functions. It is shown that the reactive part of the acoustic impedance of any harmonically vibrating membrane of whatever amplitude distribution is always negative. This part can be calculated by integrating the radiation pattem over complex space directions. Section 6 shows expansions in spherical wave functions, applied to the radiation field of a membrane oscillating with nodal lines. King's statement that the theory of Backhaus regarding certain expansions in spherical coordinates does not hold is shown to be erroneous. For the sake of completeness the theory of section 6 is worked out in detail in the case of the Rayleigh plate. This is to be found in section 7. To preserve the reader from many tedious operations the majority of the necessary mathematical calculations are given in a separate mathematical appendix...|$|E

The purpose of the grease gun is to apply lubricant through an aperture to a specific point, usually on a grease fitting or 'nipple'. The channels behind the grease nipple lead to where the lubrication is needed. The aperture may be of a type that fits closely with a receiving aperture on any number of mechanical devices. The close <b>fitting</b> of the <b>apertures</b> ensures that lubricant is applied only where needed. There are three types of grease gun: ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the main features of the software package named FITSH, intended to provide a standalone environment for analysis of data acquired by imaging astronomical detectors. The package provides utilities both for the full pipeline of subsequent related data processing steps (incl. image calibration, astrometry, source identification, photometry, differential analysis, low-level arithmetic operations, multiple image combinations, spatial transformations and interpolations, etc.) and for aiding {{the interpretation of the}} (mainly photometric and/or astrometric) results. The package also features a consistent implementation of photometry based on image subtraction, point spread function <b>fitting</b> and <b>aperture</b> photometry and provides easy-to-use interfaces for comparisons and for picking the most suitable method for a particular problem. This set of utilities found in the package are built {{on the top of the}} commonly used UNIX/POSIX shells (hence the name of the package), therefore both frequently used and well-documented tools for such environments can be exploited and managing massive amount of data is rather convenient.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of Blind Source Separation (BSS) when the hidden sources are Nonnegative (N-BSS). In this case, the scatter plot of the mixed data is {{contained}} within the simplicial cone generated by the columns of the mixing matrix. The proposed method, termed SCSA-UNS for Simplicial Cone Shrinking Algorithm for Unmixing Non-negative Sources, aims at estimating the mixing matrix and the sources by <b>fitting</b> a Minimum <b>Aperture</b> Simplicial Cone (MASC) to the cloud of mixed data points. SCSA-UNS is evaluated on both independent and correlated synthetic data and compared to other N-BSS methods. Simulations are also performed on real Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrum (LC-MS) data for the metabolomic analysis of a chemical sample, and on real dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images, in order to study the pharmacokinetics of the [18 F]-FDG (FluoroDeoxyGlucose) tracer in the brain...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new Hybrid Photometry and Extraction Routine: Hyper. It is {{designed}} to do compact source photometry allowing for varying spatial resolution and sensitivity in multi-wavelength surveys. Hyper combines multi-Gaussian <b>fitting</b> with <b>aperture</b> photometry to provide reliable photometry in regions with variable backgrounds and in crowded fields. The background is evaluated and removed locally for each source using polynomial fits of various orders. Source de-blending is done through simultaneous multi-Gaussian fitting of the main source and its companion(s), followed by the subtraction of the companion(s). Hyper allows also simultaneous multi-wavelength photometry by setting a fixed aperture size independent of the map resolution and evaluating the source flux within the same region of the sky at multiple wavelengths at the same time. This new code has been initially designed for precise aperture photometry in complex fields such as the Galactic plane observed in the far infrared (FIR) by the Herschel infrared survey of the Galactic plane (Hi-GAL). Hyper has been tested on both simulated and real Herschel fields to quantify {{the quality of the}} source identification and photometry. The code is highly modular and fully parameterisable, therefore it can be easily adapted to different experiments. Comparison of the Hyper photometry with the catalogued sources in the Bolocam Galactic Plane survey (BGPS), the 1. 1 mm survey of the Galactic Plane carried out with the Caltech Sub-millimeter observatory, demonstrates the versatility of Hyper on different datasets. It is fast and light in its memory usage, and it is freely available to the scientific community. Comment: 23 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables. Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R

Interferometric observations of Saturn and the rings {{have been obtained}} at 3. 71 and 1. 30 cm wavelengths. The observations have been analyzed by both model <b>fitting</b> and <b>aperture</b> synthesis techniques. They show that the rings have a very low brightness temperature, but attenuate the thermal emission from the planet significantly where they cross in front of it. The latter effect, when combined with the estimate of the ring brightness temperature, permits the optical depths of the rings to be estimated. The fits of the interferometric data to Saturn models in which the A and B rings are combined into a single ring are given in Table (1). The 3. 71 cm observations were made at two epochs and the relative areas of the A and B rings that obscured the planet were different. The apparently inconsistent optical depth results of the two 3. 71 cm data sets, then, indicate that the A ring optical depth is significantly {{less than that of}} the B ring. The relative areas of the A and B rings are the same for the 1976 1. 30 cm and 3. 71 cm observations and their optical depth results may be directly compared. They indicate that the ring optical depths are the same at the two wavelengths. These optical depths are quite similar to those estimated at visible wavelengths. The ring brightness temperatures, which are shown in the table normalized by the brightness temperature of the planet to remove any errors in the absolute calibration of the data, are also the same at the two wavelengths. No variation in the brightness temperature of the rings with tilt angle (B) was detected. A significant amount of radiation from the C ring was detected by the 3. 71 cm observations, and the ring was also found to attenuate the planetary emission significantly. Unfortunately, the 1. 30 cm observations were not sensitive enough to detect the C ring. The brightness temperature and optical depth results for the individual rings that are implied by all of the 3. 71 cm observations are given in Table (ii). Limb-darkening of the planetary emission was simulated by solving for the best fitting planetary radius. No limb-darkening was detected at 3. 71 cm, but an apparently significant amount was detected at 1. 30 cm. The results at the two wavelengths are significantly different and indicate that the planet is more limb-dark at 1. 30 cm than at 3. 71 cm. This finding is interesting since it is contrary to what was predicted by atmospheric models which fit the Saturn microwave spectrum. The aperture synthesis analysis is independent of the model fitting and can be used to confirm its results and search for new features not included in the models. The aperture synthesis maps confirm the model fitting results and require no new brightness structures. In particular, no azimuthal variations of the brightness temperature of the rings were detected. The aperture synthesis maps also indicated that the true position of Saturn may be offset from the values given in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac by about 0. 3 arcsec. Consideration of simple physical models of the rings has shown that the radiation from the rings at centimeter wavelengths is almost entirely thermal emission from the planet that is scattered to the Earth by the ring particles. The models indicate that the ring particles are very good scatterers and very poor emitters at microwave wavelengths, and this conclusion sets constraints upon the size and composition of the ring particles. The similarity between the optical depths of the rings at visible and centimeter wavelengths probably indicates that the particles are much larger (≥ 1 meter) than the centimeter wavelengths. The large sizes and excellent scattering properties of the particles indicate that they are composed of either a highly reflective or transparent material. At this time water ice is the most likely candidate, since it has been detected in the rings spectroscopically and is known to be highly transparent to microwaves at the low temperatures found at Saturn's rings.
