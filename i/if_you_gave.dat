[...] "They were noisy, knew their cricket, and could be intimidating <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> them room", Reiffel recalled. [...] "he bowl was resounding in anticipation [...]" [...] The Australian strategy was to occupy the crease and compile as large a total as possible, fearing the fourth-innings pitch. [...] Steve Waugh, coming in at 73 for three, joined his brother Mark, [...] "batted magnificently and built a fortress strong enough to keep West Indies at bay. [...] Mark nonchalantly scored a beautiful century before getting out, but by then he had helped Steve build a solid platform." [...] Inspired by Waugh's intrepid double century and the West Indies' depleted psychological funds, Reiffel picked up three quick wickets on the second-last evening. [...] By the reckoning of Reiffel, it was this match — and, more specifically, Waugh's century, [...] "one of the greatest feats of batting I ever witnessed" [...] — which signified the transition of cricketing supremacy from the West Indies to Australia. [...] It also secured the Frank Worrell Trophy.|$|E
