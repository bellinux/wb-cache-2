5|$|Despite these successes, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of Dragoon by some Allied generals and contemporary commentators such as Bernard Montgomery, Arthur R. Wilson, and Chester Wilmot in the aftermath, {{mostly because of}} its geo-strategic implications. It was argued that Dragoon diverted highly-experienced men and much-needed material away from the continuing fighting at the Western front {{that could have been}} used, instead, to bolster the Italian front or to hasten the advance towards the Rhine by the Overlord forces. The resulting loss of momentum gave Stalin on the Eastern Front a free hand to pursue his offensive efforts with more determination, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the race towards Berlin and occupy the Balkans. Dragoon therefore had consequences reaching into the Cold War.|$|E

Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut.|$|E

He was the first male skater since Terry Kubicka to win {{back-to-back}} Novice and Junior Men's titles in the United States. The win on the junior level was unusual in that Lysacek moved from third to first overall while sitting backstage, because he won through a tiebreak in the 6.0 ordinal system. Lysacek was tied with Parker Pennington in second place ordinals and had one more first place ordinal, giving him the win in the free skate in the Total Ordinals of Majority tiebreaker, which pushed him ahead in overall factored placements, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the title overall. Following the U.S. Championships, he was assigned to the 2000 Gardena Spring Trophy in Urtijëi where he won the silver medal on the junior level.|$|E
