50|$|Like The Sun and The Moon, <b>Stir</b> the <b>Blood</b> was not {{released}} in the UK due to a legal battle with the UK label.|$|R
6000|$|This {{unexpected}} utterance astounded the Capataz by {{its character}} of cold-blooded atrocity. It {{was as much}} as to say, [...] "I wish you had shown yourself a coward; I wish you had had your throat cut for your pains." [...] Naturally he referred it to himself, whereas it related only to the silver, being uttered simply and with many mental reservations. Surprise and rage rendered him speechless, and the doctor pursued, practically unheard by Nostromo, whose <b>stirred</b> <b>blood</b> was beating violently in his ears.|$|R
5000|$|... "Make {{no little}} plans; {{they have no}} magic to <b>stir</b> men's <b>blood,</b> and {{probably}} themselves will not be realized. Make big plans: aim high in hope and work ..." [...] Daniel Burnham ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better {{the horse}} should die of cold than I," [...] I {{answered}} gruffly, and turning from him I set myself to pace {{the snow and}} <b>stir</b> the <b>blood</b> that was chilling in my veins.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt the}} <b>blood</b> <b>stir</b> about {{my heart and}} rise warm to my cheek.|$|R
60|$|There was a curious, {{almost a}} {{pleading}} earnestness in her tone. Her eyes had {{something new to}} say, something which, though it failed to <b>stir</b> his <b>blood,</b> made him vaguely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, he answered her without hesitation.|$|R
5000|$|Burnham is famously {{quoted as}} saying, [...] "Make no little plans. They have no magic to <b>stir</b> men's <b>blood</b> and {{probably}} will not themselves be realized." [...] This slogan has been taken to {{capture the essence of}} Burnham's spirit.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stir</b> the <b>Blood</b> is {{the third}} and final studio album by New York-based rock band The Bravery. The album was {{released}} on December 1, 2009, and features the singles [...] "Slow Poison" [...] and [...] "I Am Your Skin".|$|R
6000|$|Again Harper {{looked at}} him with a faint flush in his face, for the boldness of the venture <b>stirred</b> the <b>blood</b> in him. “It’s the biggest thing I’ve ever had a hand in,” he said. “Still, {{wherever}} it leads to, I’m going through with you!” ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{the drum}} rolled on, and <b>stirred</b> our <b>blood</b> to fresh extravagance that night. The clarion sound and clang of corselet and buckler were heard from many a hamlet of the soul, and many a knight was arming {{for the fight}} behind the encamped stars.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood beside}} her; not loth, for {{excitement}} {{had begun to}} <b>stir</b> his <b>blood.</b> They stayed there for some minutes, straining their eyes for sight of anything save the little zagged splashes of bursting shrapnel, while voices buzzed, and muttered: [...] "Look! There! There! There it is!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{any time}} such news would have <b>stirred</b> the <b>blood</b> of Ian, {{but at that}} time, when the autumn was nearly over, and hope had almost died in the breast of our {{scholastic}} backwoodsman, the news burst upon him with the thrilling force of an electric shock.|$|R
5000|$|... "Slow Poison" [...] is a 2009 song by the American indie {{rock band}} The Bravery. It {{was the first}} single from their album <b>Stir</b> the <b>Blood.</b> It peaked at #23 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and at #40 on the Rock Songs chart.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you speak}} like that," [...] she exclaimed with an <b>enthusiasm</b> that <b>stirred</b> him, despite {{the trouble of}} his mind, [...] "I cannot think of you as a clergyman,--but as a man. Indeed," [...] she added, in the {{surprise}} of her discovery, [...] "I have never thought of you as a clergyman--even when I first saw you this morning. I could not account then {{for a sense of}} duality about you that puzzled me. Do you always preach as earnestly as that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forbear!" [...] cried Alleyne. [...] "Mix not God's {{name with}} these unhallowed threats! And {{yet it was}} a coward's blow, and one to <b>stir</b> the <b>blood</b> and loose the tongue of the most peaceful. Let me find some {{soothing}} simples and lay them on the weal to draw the sting." ...|$|R
60|$|He was (as Redfield had said) highly susceptible, made so by his solitary {{life in the}} mountains, and to {{be seated}} close beside this maid of the valley <b>stirred</b> his <b>blood</b> to the danger-point. It was only by an effort of the will that he {{kept in touch with}} Redfield's remarks.|$|R
6000|$|But, {{the dead}} plunder once secured And safe beside the vessel moored, All that had <b>stirred</b> the <b>blood</b> before Is so much blubber, nothing more, [...] 170 (I mean no pun, nor image so Mere sentimental verse, you know,) And all is tedium, smoke, and soil, In trying out the noisome oil.|$|R
60|$|The lad's tone, equally {{with his}} words, was well {{calculated}} to <b>stir</b> the <b>blood,</b> and as I {{saw in the}} future a possibility that Silver Heels might yet be reclaimed by me, I ceased to mourn her as being lost forever, but gave all my thoughts to the triumph which awaited our people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not, indeed!" [...] Jack exclaimed warmly. [...] "Such acts {{as these}} would <b>stir</b> the <b>blood</b> of the coldest into fire; and, priest or no priest, {{a man would}} be less than {{a man who did}} not try to take vengeance for so foul a deed. Have many massacres of this sort been perpetrated?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{if there}} was one thing more than another that David Laidlaw desired to see, it was a London fire. Often had he read about these fires, for he was a great reader of books, as well as newspapers, and deeply had his <b>enthusiasm</b> been <b>stirred</b> (though not expressed) by {{accounts}} of thrilling escapes and heroic deeds among the firemen. His eyes therefore flashed back the flame of the lamps as the engine went past him like a red thunderbolt, and he started off in pursuit of it.|$|R
60|$|Hetty's eyes sparkled; the stockriders {{seemed to}} swing more lightly in their saddles, and Flora Schuyler {{felt a little}} quiver run through her. Something that {{jingling}} rhythm and the simple words expressed but inarticulately <b>stirred</b> her <b>blood,</b> as she remembered that in her nation's last great struggle the long battalions had limped on, ragged and footsore, singing that song.|$|R
50|$|The Baltimore SunThe voices {{rang out}} with resplendent confidence, and the sopranos had no {{apparent}} difficulty reaching the cruel and challenging high B's in the piece. The chorus's performance {{was the best}} part of the concert….the thunderous power of this unique masterpiece never fails to <b>stir</b> the <b>blood,</b> and the ovation was loud, long and well deserved.|$|R
5000|$|The Bravery headlined {{an entire}} North American tour {{prior to the}} <b>Stir</b> the <b>Blood,</b> December 1, 2009 release. Fans were {{able to meet the}} band after {{pre-ordering}} the album. An iTunes pre-order for the album began on Tuesday, November 10. New song [...] "I Am Your Skin" [...] was made available to download when pre-ordering the album.|$|R
5000|$|While {{recording}} the <b>Stir</b> the <b>Blood</b> album, Endicott and producer John Hill co-wrote three songs with Shakira for her album She Wolf, including the single She Wolf and critically acclaimed song [...] "Men In This Town". She Wolf and its Spanish version counterpart [...] "Loba," [...] had major commercial success selling more than 2 millions copies worldwide.|$|R
60|$|Off {{they went}} at last over the smooth beach to the pole with the flag at the further end, {{and every one}} watched them with mingled {{interest}} and merriment, for they were a droll set, and the running not at all scientific with most of them. One young fisherman with big boots over his trousers started off at a great pace, pounding along in the most dogged way, while a little chap in a tight bathing-suit with very thin legs skimmed by him, looking so like a sand-piper {{it was impossible to}} help laughing at both. Jack's former training stood him in good stead now; for he went to work in professional style, and kept a steady trot till the flagpole had been passed, then he put on his speed and shot ahead of all the rest, several of whom broke down and gave up. But Cox and Bacon held on gallantly; and soon it was evident that the sturdy legs in the knickerbockers were gaining fast, for Jack gave his ankle an ugly wrench on a round pebble, and the weak knee began to fail. He did his best, however, and quite a breeze of <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>stirred</b> the spectators as the three boys came down the course like mettlesome horses, panting, pale, or purple, but each bound to win at any cost.|$|R
60|$|It was a sight well {{calculated}} to <b>stir</b> the <b>blood</b> {{of a boy}} from Virginia, and my excitement, my admiration for the coolness of our people, and the determination shown where the Britishers were {{doing their best to}} work destruction, fired my heart until it was with difficulty I could continue my share of the work at pulling the skiff.|$|R
5000|$|Although now {{considered}} dated, Helicopter Canada, during its initial release, received positive reviews. Joan Fox wrote in The Globe and Mail, [...] "If this film doesn’t <b>stir</b> your Canadian <b>blood,</b> nothing will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some!" [...] exclaimed Cynthia, [...] "why, {{you have}} walked lame ever since." [...] She knew the story by heart, but the recital of it {{never failed to}} <b>stir</b> her <b>blood!</b> [...] "They carried him out {{just as he was}} going to be burned up, in a blanket hung from rifles, and he was in the {{hospital}} nine months, and had to come home for a while." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, tucking {{her head}} in his breast, hiding her face, she timidly slid her hands along his sides, {{pressing}} softly, to find the contours of his figure. Softly her hands crept over the silky back of his waistcoat, under his coats, and as they <b>stirred,</b> his <b>blood</b> flushed up, and up again, with fire, till all Siegmund was hot blood, and his breast was one great ache.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} silent for a few moments, and in her {{expression}} there was a hint of regret that <b>stirred</b> Jimmy’s <b>blood.</b> They had seen a good deal of each other during the voyage; and it was painful to the man to realize that in all probability their acquaintance must soon come to an end; but he ventured to think that his companion shared his feelings to some extent.|$|R
60|$|Still {{there was}} no reply; {{therefore}} Snorro, <b>stirred</b> by the <b>blood</b> which had descended to him through {{a long line of}} illustrious and warlike sea-kings, lost his temper, stamped his feet, and screeched with passion.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing {{the second}} season {{production}} of The Tempest for The Times Literary Supplement, Stanley Reynolds opined that although [...] "there is very little for purists to find fault with ... the most damning thing you could say about it is {{there is nothing to}} <b>stir</b> the <b>blood</b> to hot flashes of anger or to the electric joy of a new experience. What we got was some more of the BBC's ghastly middle taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How fearfully good! How frightfully nice if you could!' cried Gudrun warmly, her colour {{flushing}} up again. It {{made the}} <b>blood</b> <b>stir</b> in his veins, the subtle way {{she turned to}} him and infused her gratitude into his body.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{very faint}} and far off, a rhythmic {{throbbing}} crept {{out of the}} darkness, and Flora Schuyler, who, fearing her ears had deceived her at first, dared not speak, felt her chilled <b>blood</b> <b>stir</b> when Hetty flung back her head.|$|R
