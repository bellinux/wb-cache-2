According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

In the promotional tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was performed as the fifth {{song of the}} setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. Every time the chorus played, Madonna and her back-up dancers jumped up and down, while waving their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air.

John Murphy, in his review of Pure Heroine for musicOMH, commended the lyrics [...] "I'm kinda over getting told to throw my <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air" [...] for being catchy.

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it put your <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Team" [...] is a [...] "tribute to {{her friends}} and country". During an {{interview}} with Billboard, Lorde described the song as [...] "her take on most modern music" [...] and explained, [...] "no one comes to New Zealand, no one knows anything about New Zealand, and here I am, trying {{to grow up and}} become a person." [...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put your hands in the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to throw my <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were a response to the lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E

6000|$|Joan, on {{her black}} horse, with the Lieutenant-General and the {{personal}} staff grouped about her, took post for a final review and a good-by; for she was not expecting to ever be a soldier again, or ever serve with these or any other soldiers any more after this day. The army knew this, and believed it {{was looking for the}} last time upon the girlish face of its invincible little Chief, its pet, its pride, its darling, whom it had ennobled in its private heart with nobilities of its own creation, call her [...] "Daughter of God," [...] "Savior of France," [...] "Victory's Sweetheart," [...] "The Page of Christ," [...] together with still softer titles which were simply naive and frank endearments such as men are used to confer upon children whom they love. And so one saw a new thing now; a thing bred of the emotion that was present there on both sides. Always before, in the march-past, the battalions had gone swinging by in a storm of cheers, heads up and eyes flashing, the drums rolling, the bands braying paens of victory; but now there was nothing of that. But for one impressive sound, one could have closed his eyes and imagined himself in a world of the dead. That one sound was all that visited the ear in the summer stillness--just that one sound--the muffled tread of the marching host. As the serried masses drifted by, the men put their right hands up to their temples, palms to the front, in military salute, turning their eyes upon Joan's face in mute God-bless-you and farewell, and keeping them there while they could. They still kept their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> reverent salute many steps after they had passed by. Every time Joan put her handkerchief to her eyes you could see a little quiver of emotion crinkle along the faces of the files.|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How long does it take to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E

60|$|When handled or nursed, it {{was very}} quiet and contented, but when laid down by itself would {{invariably}} cry; {{and for the first}} few nights was very restless and noisy. I fitted up a little box for a cradle, with a soft mat for it to lie upon, which was changed and washed every day; and I soon found it necessary to wash the little Mias as well. After I had done so a few times, it came to like the operation, and {{as soon as it was}} dirty would begin crying and not leave off until I took it out and carried it to the spout, when it immediately became quiet, although it would wince a little at the first rush of the cold water and make ridiculously wry faces while the stream was running over its head. It enjoyed the wiping and rubbing dry amazingly, and when I brushed its hair seemed to be perfectly happy, lying quite still with its arms and legs stretched out while I thoroughly brushed the long hair of its back and arms. For the first few days it clung desperately with all four hands to whatever it could lay hold of, and I had to be careful to keep my beard out of its way, as its fingers clutched hold of hair more tenaciously than anything else, and it was impossible to free myself without assistance. When restless, it would struggle about with its <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air trying to find something to take hold of, and, when it had got a bit of stick or rag in two or three of its hands, seemed quite happy. For want of something else, it would often seize its own feet, and after a time it would constantly cross its arms and grasp with each hand the long hair that grew just below the opposite shoulder. The great tenacity of its grasp soon diminished, and I was obliged to invent some means to give it exercise and strengthen its limbs. For this purpose I made a short ladder of three or four rounds, on which I put it to hang for a quarter of an hour at a time. At first it seemed much pleased, but it could not get all four hands in a comfortable position, and, after changing about several times, would leave hold of one hand after the other, and drop onto the floor. Sometimes when hanging only by two hands, it would loose one, and cross it to the opposite shoulder, grasping its own hair; and, as this seemed much more agreeable than the stick, it would then loose the other and tumble down, when it would cross both and lie on its back quite contentedly, never seeming to be hurt by its numerous tumbles. Finding it so fond of hair, I endeavoured to make an artificial mother, by wrapping up a piece of buffalo-skin into a bundle, and suspending it about a foot from the floor. At first this seemed to suit it admirably, as it could sprawl its legs about and always find some hair, which it grasped with the greatest tenacity. I was now in hopes that I had made the little orphan quite happy; and so it seemed for some time, until it began to remember its lost parent, and try to suck. It would pull itself up close to the skin, and try about everywhere for a likely place; but, as it only succeeded in getting mouthfuls of hair and wool, it would be greatly disgusted, and scream violently, and, after two or three attempts, let go altogether. One day it got some wool into its throat, and I thought it would have choked, but after much gasping it recovered, and I was obliged to take the imitation mother to pieces again, and give up this last attempt to exercise the little creature.|$|E
