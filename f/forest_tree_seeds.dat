Nothofagus alpina, N. obliqua, N. glauca, N. leonii and N. dombeyi conformed to the seed viability equation of Ellis and Roberts; sensitivity of longevity to temperature was quantitatively {{similar to that}} of crop seeds, sensitivity to moisture was somewhat less, and a low-moisture-content limit to the equation was detected at 4. 8 % moisture content in hermetic storage at 65 degrees C, and possibly similar moisture contents at 30 - 40 degrees C. These five species show orthodox seed storage behaviour. Therefore, ex-situ conservation of these Nothofagus species in seed banks is possible, but the quality of seed lots collected requires attention. Seed storage behaviour was not defined in N. pumilio: initial seed quality was poor and loss of viability was detected over 2 years at 0 degrees, - 10 degrees and - 20 degrees C at 2. 7 % moisture content, but not at 5. 2 %.

40|$|A {{trade-off}} between {{growth and}} mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated {{conditions under which}} the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates {{of the fastest growing}} individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r 2 = 0. 69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r 2 = 0. 46), and much weaker for large trees (r 2 ≤ 0. 10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among <b>forest</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>Seed</b> mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality.

It is generally believed that the abundant quantities of fertile seeds are produced by middle aged or medium sized parent <b>trees.</b> <b>Seed</b> produced by immature as well as over matured trees often give lower germination and seedling vigour (Khanna, 1977). In frequent seed years, low germinative capacity of <b>seeds</b> of <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species necessitates collection of as much quantities of seeds as possible (Arya et al., 1994).

The varying quality of seeds from forest stands and seed orchards does not full fill the germination requirements of tree nurseries. Multi-phase pre-treatment are therefore used in <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> centres to improve seed lots quality. The main objectives of this study were to analyse long-term variation in the size and quality of Scots pine seed crops in Northern Finland. Determine the impact of fungal injuries on the structures of Norway spruce seeds. To detect changes in the germination capacity and rate of Norway spruce seeds during pre-treatment phases and to determine the impacts of short-term and long-term storage on the germination of treated seeds. The study found that in most years, regeneration of Scots pine in Northern Finland is limited by quantity as well as quality the seed crop. The long-term average of the Scots pine seed crop was 77 seeds/m 2 and the long-term average expected germination percentage was 61 %. Aeciospores of the inlad spruce cone rust Chrysomyxa pirolata (Körnicke) Wint. were found to form inside Norway spruce seeds, destroying the nucellar layers and reducing germination of seeds. In general, the germination capacity and rate of Norway spruce seeds increased during pre-treatment phases. The germination capacity of seeds increased about 30 % and the rate by more than 40 % during pre-treatment. During long-term storage the germination capacity and rate of pre-treated Scots pine seeds were preserved better in frozen storage than in cool storage. It was found that pre-treated Scots pine forest stand seeds can be stored for several years in frozen conditions. The germination capacity and rate of pre-treated orchard seeds were effected significantly more than those from forest stands. It is therefore recommended that Scots pine seeds from orchards be stored without pre-treatment. The germination capacity and rate of treated Norway spruce seeds from orchards was not significantly different after one year of storage...|$|R

Samples of adult, seedling and seed from two sites in Costa Rica were analysed to estimate mating system parameters, genetic diversity and gene flow. Spatial modelling was used to investigate the effects of seed and pollen dispersal on the genetic dynamics of recolonisation and to assess potential forest management strategies. Genetic diversity was higher in primary than in secondary forest indicating that colonisation caused a loss of alleles. However, higher diversity was found in secondary <b>forests</b> <b>trees</b> and <b>seeds</b> than in seedlings suggesting that, with time, high levels of gene flow may counter initial diversity loss due to founder effects. Genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of individuals contributing to founding populations had significant and population-specific effects.

In this work, we successfully applied an alternative parent selection tactic based on paternity testing of superior offspring derived from a hybrid seed orchard established with a single Eucalyptus grandis seed parents and six E. urophylla pollen parents. A battery of 14 microsatellite markers was used to carry out parentage tests of 256 progeny individuals including two independent samples of selected trees and one control unselected sample, all derived from 6 -year-old forest stands in eastern Brazil. Paternity determination was carried out for all progeny individuals by a sequential paternity exclusion procedure. Exclusion was declared only when the obligatory paternal allele in the progeny tree was not present in the alleged parent tree for at least four independent markers to avoid false exclusions due to mutation or null alleles. After maternity checks to identify seed mixtures and selfed individuals, the paternity tests revealed that approximately 29 % of the offspring was sired by pollen parents outside the orchard. No selfed progeny were found in the selected samples. Three pollen parents were found to have sired essentially all of the offspring in the samples of selected and non-selected progeny individuals. One of these three parents sired significantly more selected progeny than unselected ones (P_ 0. 0002 in a Fisher exact test). Based on these results, low-reproductive-successful parents were culled from the orchard, and management procedures were adopted to minimize external pollen contamination. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) in mean annual increment was observed between forest stands produced with seed from the orchard before and after selection of parents and revitalization of the orchard. An average realized gain of 24. 3 % in volume growth was obtained from the selection of parents as measured in forest stands at age 2 – 4 years.

Micrometeorological conditions, soil water content, and plant water potential were generally similar across habitats. Certain aspects of leaves (such as Specific Leaf Area and foliar N content), and photosynthesis (e. g. quantum yield and electron transport rate) were highest in the plantations, intermediate in the secondary forests, and lowest in abandoned pastures. Enhanced rates of photosynthetic biochemistry (such as V cmax and J max) and Photo system II efficiency (e. g. thermal energy dissipation) occurred in leaves from the plantations compared to the abandoned pastures, which {{may be related to}} higher leaf %N content.

Because of their high variability within populations, microsatellite genetic markers were chosen for the study, and it was verified through an initial sampling experiment that this class of markers is sufficiently stable within somatic tissue of large and long-lived trees such that population studies could be undertaken with them. By sampling adult <b>trees</b> and <b>seed</b> progenies at several microsatellite loci, high levels of gene flow and low levels of inbreeding were found within populations of Sextonia rubra and Carapa guianensis, two important insect-pollinated Amazonian <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species.

Comparing different populations distributed over the Amazon basin, a phylogeographical structure in the chloroplast DNA of Carapa guianensis that corresponds to major tributaries of the Amazon river was discovered, suggesting that seed dispersal through rivers may contribute to genetic connectivity among populations. Overall, the results of this thesis suggest that the large effective population sizes, the high levels of gene flow, and the low levels of inbreeding in exploited Amazonian tree populations may allow them to counteract potential negative genetic impacts of selective logging, at least at the levels of harvesting carried out during this study, and for the Carapa guianensis population investigated...|$|R

In contrast, herbaceous cover increased from 0 to 72 %. Nonetheless, forest structure and diversity recovered slowly towards pre-burn levels, except for <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks that remained depleted even 15 years after fire. Sites burnt twice had on average 0 % trees, 1 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> abundance, 3 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> species richness and 1 % root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. Herbaceous cover increased to 100 %. Mean recovery of tree basal area was 50 % slower and of root mat thickness 93 % slower compared to recovery in sites burnt once. <b>Tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks did not recover at all, and herbaceous cover persisted close to 100 % for more than 20 years after the second fire. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that after a second fire event, Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests lose their recovery capacity, and persist in a non-forested state dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Such fragility implies that preventing human ignited fires during drought episodes is a particularly important conservation strategy for these ecosystems. </p...|$|R

For example, the domestication of many crop plants was initiated some 10 000 years ago in the so-called ÔFertile CrescentÕ of the Middle East. By contrast, the domestication of <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for the purposes of producing more fibre began in earnest in the last half century. The application of biotechnology to <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> offers a great potential to hasten the pace of tree improvement for desirable end uses.

40|$|Planting genetically {{modified}} (GM) or transgenic <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for wood production is now feasible {{on a commercial}} scale worldwide. What are the benefits? What are the risks? This became an open question two years ago on December 10, 2003, when the United Nations declared that every sovereign nation should decide on its own {{whether or not to}} use {{genetically modified}} forests for carbon sequestration. Although feasible on a commercial scale, we are still {{in the early stages of}} GM technology for <b>forest</b> <b>trees.</b> Some of the major determinants shaping risks of commercial-scale use include type(s) of inserted DNA construct or transgene, 1 but also 1) reproductive biology of the forest species, and 2) the forest production or silvicultural systems. 2 To date, GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> are being tested in small trials worldwide. Only China is planting GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> on a commercial scale. Central to the issue of GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> is the question of biosafety. Will effective biosafety protocols eventually become available, or should we accept that escape of GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> is inevitable and study ecological consequences instead? Here I present the argument for the latter and propose a public-private partnership for this purpose, a technology trust. Commercial GM Forests: Predicting the Long-term Consequences Each nation sanctioning genetically engineering <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> must decide 1) what biosafety protocols should be considered, if any, and 2) weigh the consequences in the event that gene flow from GM forest plantations to th...|$|R

40|$|Agroforests are model {{systems for}} {{ecological}} conservation in tropical agricultural landscapes because they integrate biodiversity conservation and rural livelihoods. Whether agroforests are long-term solutions for conserving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes may depend sapling regeneration of native <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> in agroforests. In this dissertation, I ask two main questions: are native <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> regenerating in agroforests and if so, {{what are the}} ecological and social drivers? I tested the influence of potential seed sources from both the landscape and parent trees found in the agroforest. I also examined how a set of social factors affected native <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> regeneration. The social drivers I tested include tree management and use, land tenure and state-restricted rights to harvest native timber. I found {{that a number of}} native pioneer species are regenerating at relatively high frequencies and abundances. I also found that many secondary native <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species are also regenerating although their sapling are found less frequently and at lower abundances. Most primary <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species present as adults are not regenerating and lacked sapling in the agroforests. The influence of the ecological factors was limited. The main drivers of native <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> regeneration on farms are the understorey management and the rural extension services that assisted farms obtain state-restricted rights...|$|R
