40|$|International audience— Legislation {{concerning}} {{pollutant emissions}} of diesel passenger cars {{is becoming increasingly}} restrictive, especially for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). This article proposes to apply a CRONE control design methodology on a diesel engine in order to adapt the air-path and fuel-path of the engine and minimize NOx emissions. As the multivariable CRONE control strategies need a nominal transfer function and some frequency response of the system (G(s)), several test-bench experiments and a linear identification of the system were performed. The aim of this approach {{was to find a}} decoupling and stabilizing controller for the combustion engine that minimized NOx emissions at each operating point considered and during transient of torque/engine speed. The system is a square multivariable system with three inputs: <b>Exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> <b>valve</b> (EGR), variable geometry turbine (VGT), and start of injection (SOI); and three outputs: mass air flow (MAF), boost pressure (Pboost) and NOx level (NOx). The CRONE control approach developed for multivariable square plants is based on the third generation scalar CRONE methodology. Fractional order transfer functions were used to define all the components of the diagonal open-loop transfer matrix, β. Optimisation gave the best fractional open-loop transfer matrix and finally, frequency domain system identification was used to find a robust controller. Performances of the proposed control structure were tested and validated with a number of experiments on a high dynamic test bed (NEDC driving cycle) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{powertrain}} controllers {{relies on the}} availability of data-driven models of the emissions formation from internal-combustion engines. Typically these are in the form of tables or statistical regression models based on data obtained from stabilised experiments. However, as the complexity of engine systems increases, the number of experiments required to obtain the effects of each actuator becomes large. In addition, the models are only valid under stable operating conditions and do not give any information as to dynamic behaviour. In this paper, the use of the Volterra series (dynamic polynomial models) calculated from dynamic measurements is presented {{as an alternative to the}} steady-state models. Dynamic measurements of gaseous exhaust emissions were taken for a 2. 0 l automotive diesel engine installed on a transient engine dynamometer. Sinusoidally based excitations were used to vary the engine speed, the load, the main injection timing, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> <b>valve</b> position and the fuel injection pressure.

Engine electrification is a critical technology in the promotion of engine fuel efficiency, among which the electrified turbocharger {{is regarded as the}} promising solution in engine downsizing.

40|$|The gas {{exchange}} and combustion processes {{in a modern}} diesel engine are dynamically linked — outputs of the combustion process (exhaust temperature, exhaust pressure and exhaust enthalpy) directly affect inputs to the air handling system. Likewise, the {{gas exchange}} process directly influences the inputs to the combustion process, including the in-cylinder trapped mass or charge mass, charge temperature and pressure. In modern diesel engines, this complex dynamic interaction is influenced by conventional actuators like variable-geometry turbochargers and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> <b>valves.</b> In newer architectures, this relationship is further influenced by flexibility in the valve train, and modulation of valve opening and closing times greatly impacts mass flows through the engine. ^ Two major drivers of the gas exchange process are the turbocharger and the engine 2 ̆ 7 s effective compression ratio. The turbocharger, driven by <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> energy from the combustion process, drives compressed fresh air into the intake manifold, as well as determines how much <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> is recirculated through the engine. The effective compression ratio {{is a measure of}} the effective in-cylinder piston motion- and momentum-induced compression of the trapped gases, and is directly impacted by modulation of intake valve closing time. Modeling and control of the gas exchange process, as well as the impact effective compression ratio has on it, is essential for the promotion and control of advanced mode combustion techniques aimed at reducing emissions while maintaining efficiency. To date, gas exchange and turbocharger modeling efforts largely make use of complex stand-alone packages or depend upon interpolation from empirically-derived look-up tables. Accurate estimation and control techniques often require use of expensive sensors that may not be commonplace in production engines. The most common method of determining effective compression ratio relies heavily on the availability of accurate in-cylinder pressure measurements, which is rare in production engines. ^ One of the main contributions in the work presented here outlines a strategy for modeling the complex turbocharger system using analytical equations, rather than performance maps, and implements the resulting equations in a control-oriented gas exchange model. The gas exchange model is tested against experimental engine data, first using the traditional turbocharger performance maps, then using the developed analytical equations. The model results when using the analytical functions show good agreement with the experimental engine data. ^ The gas exchange model is then leveraged to develop an estimation scheme for effective compression ratio. Rather than rely on lab-grade in-cylinder pressure measurements, this work details an estimation scheme based only on knowledge available from typical production-viable on-engine sensors. This estimation scheme is based on a high-gain observer design for a first order system, and leverages a previously validated physically-based volumetric efficiency model to determine effective compression ratio. The effective compression ratio estimation scheme is validated against experimental engine data, with steady-state errors less than 3...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{inherent}} nonlinearity of the diesel engine, real-time {{control of the}} variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> (EGR) <b>valve</b> still remains a challenging task. A controller has {{to be capable of}} coping with the transient operating condition of the engine, the interactions between the VGT and EGR, and also the trade-off effect in this control problem. In this work, novel real-time fuzzy logic controllers (RFLC) were developed and tested. Firstly, the proposed controllers were calibrated and validated in a transient diesel engine model which was developed and validated against the Caterpillar 3126 B engine test bed located at the University of Sussex. The controllers were then further tested on the engine test bed. Compared to conventional controllers, the proposed controllers can effectively reduce engine emissions as well as fuel consumption. Experimental results show that compared to the baseline engine running on the Nonroad Transient Cycle (NRTC), mean values of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> opacity and the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission production were reduced by 36. 8 % and 33 %, respectively. Instant specific fuel consumption of the RFLC engine was also reduced by up to 50 % compared to the baseline engine during the test. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy logic controllers can also reduce development time and cost by avoiding extensive engine mapping of inlet air pressure and flow. When on-line emission measurements were not available, on-board emission predictors were developed and tested to supply the proposed fuzzy logic controller with predictions of soot and NOx production. Alternatively, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controllers, which can learn from fuzzy logic controllers, were developed and tested. In the end, the proposed fuzzy logic controllers were compared with PI controllers using the transient engine model...|$|R

40|$|Within the literature, {{there are}} a number of studies {{investigating}} the benefits of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation,</b> and as a result it has become established as a promising technology for combustion control to allow engine downsizing technology to be advanced.

The literature shows that the component within <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> which has the largest chemical effect on combustion is NO, which can promote or inhibit the onset of autoignition causing reactions within the end gas at high load. The reduction in NOx <b>gases</b> in catalysed <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>recirculation</b> can increase the knock limit at high load, with some authors reporting up to a 5 ∘ crank angle improvement in combustion phasing. There is conflicting evidence on whether this translates to an improvement in fuel consumption, with one study finding a decrease of up to 2 % comparing to another finding an increase of 1. 5 %- 3. 5 %. Crude calculations on the emissions of a 2. 0 -L direct injection spark ignition engine operating at high load show that in an extreme case the reduction in the calorific value of the inlet charge due to catalysis of the recirculated gases can be up to 4. 5 %.
