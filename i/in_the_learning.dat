5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

Both species were trained to discriminate between two objects that each had a characteristic motion, so that either cue {{could be used to}} perform the task successfully. The objects were either easy or difficult to decompose into parts. At test, <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> objects could appear in either their <b>learned</b> motions, <b>the</b> reverse of <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions, an entirely new motion, or, a new object could appear <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. For humans, any change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motion produced a decrement in performance for both decomposable and non-decomposable objects, but participants did not respond differentially to new objects that appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. Pigeons showed the same pattern of responding as humans for decomposable objects, except that pigeons responded differentially to new object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> motions. For non-decomposable objects, pigeons used motion cues exclusively. We suggest that dynamic information may be processed differently by pigeons and humans as a function of whether objects are decomposable...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, it {{is argued}} that the {{responsibility}} of learning should reside increasingly with the learner (Glasersfeld, 1989).

Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read.

25|$|Plants vs. Zombies has {{received}} a positive reception from critics, garnering an aggregate score of 88/100 from Metacritic and an 89.5% from GameRankings.

25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} the learner or learners {{to arrive at}} his or her version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process (Wertsch 1997).|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays an active role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps students to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E
