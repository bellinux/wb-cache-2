25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front <b>end</b> <b>panel,</b> front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E

[...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E

50|$|Vans {{built over}} the 1888-1925 period were {{constructed}} with a single trap door installed in place of louvres {{at one end of}} the wagon, while later wagons were fitted with a trap door at each end. The trap doors were used for the insertion of long metal bars, which could be used for hanging meat.

5000|$|Folding {{pattern in}} which the folds are {{parallel}} {{and in the same}} direction, so that a kind of spiral is produced. The letter fold is a parallel fold. Two or more panels of the same width of the folded signature are folded around one panel. When the signature is folded twice, there are three panels on each side (six pages); with a tri-fold, the result is four panels on each side (eight pages). To allow proper nesting of panels that fold in, inside panels are usually 1/32" [...] to 1/8" [...] smaller than outer panels with the inside <b>end</b> <b>panel</b> being the smallest.|$|E
50|$|Panel saws {{are used}} by cabinet shops to easily cut panels, profiles, solid-wood, plywood, MDF, laminates, plastic sheets and {{melamine}} sheets into sizes or cabinet components.

Some higher <b>end</b> <b>panel</b> saws feature computer controls that move the blade and fence systems to preset values. Other lower end machines offer simplicity and ease of use, including full scale hobbyist level panel saws at a mere fraction of the cost.
