6000|$|As {{the spring}} advanced, Bartley {{conceived}} {{the plan of}} a local study, something {{in the manner of}} the boarding-house article, but on a much vaster scale: he proposed to Ricker a timely series on the easily accessible hot-weather resorts, to be called [...] "Boston's Breathing-Places," [...] and to relate mainly to the seaside hotels and their surroundings. His idea was encouraged, and he took Marcia with him on most of his expeditions for its realization. These were largely made before the regular season had well begun; but the boats were already running, and the hotels were open, and they were treated with the hospitality which a knowledge of Bartley's mission must <b>invoke.</b> <b>As</b> he said, {{it was a matter of}} business, give and take on both sides, and the landlords took more than they gave in any such trade.|$|E

5000|$|The Hundred Years' War with France (1337 - 1453) aroused English {{nationalist}} feeling. May McKisack {{has claimed}} that [...] "The most lasting and significant {{consequences of the}} war should be sought, perhaps, {{in the sphere of}} national psychology...For the victories were the victories, not only of the king and of the aristocracy, but of the nation". When the Ordinance of Normandy (in which the French King called for the elimination of the English nation and language in a second Norman conquest of England) was discovered in 1346 it was used for propaganda purposes by England. After the Siege of Calais of 1346, King Edward III expelled the inhabitants of that city because, in his words, [...] "I wolde repeople agayne the towne with pure Englysshmen". When King Henry V conquered Harfleur in 1415, he ordered the inhabitants to leave and imported English immigrants to replace them.Edward III promoted Saint George during his wars against Scotland and France. Under Edward I and Edward II, pennons bearing the Cross of Saint George were carried, along with those of Saint Edmund the Martyr and Saint Edward the Confessor. However Edward III promoted St George over the previous national saints of St Edmund, St Edward the Confessor and Saint Gregory the Great. On 13 August 1351 St George was celebrated as [...] "the blessed George, the most invincible athlete of Christ, whose name and protection the English race <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> that of their patron, in war especially". In Chichester in 1368 a guild was founded [...] "to the honour of the holy Trinity and of its glorious martyr George, protector and patron of England". The Cross of St George was used by Edward III as banners on his ships and carried by his armies. St George became the patron saint of England and his cross eventually became the flag of England.|$|E

40|$|Within {{scholarship}} on contemporary Islam, {{one of the}} issues that has generated considerable discussion (and often perplexity) concerns the accuracy or validity of Muslim historical claims. Many authors have pointed to a discrepancy between what Muslim activists today <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> belonging to the traditions of Islam and the actual historical record of Islamic societies. It is argued that historical reality is ignored or rejected, while a false, distorted, or selective version of the past is affirmed in its place. In attempting to characterize and explain this use (or misuse) of history, scholars have had recourse to a variety of concepts, some of which merit a re-examination, especially in light of recent work within historiography. A brief review of these concepts suggests a need for new analytical approaches to the styles of historical argumentation prevalent within Islam today...|$|E

An ethnography is a highly descriptive overview of a group’s knowledge, its beliefs, its social organization, how it reproduces itself, and the material world in which it exists. 3 In short, ethnography is a process referred to by Clifford Geertz as “Writing Culture”.

40|$|Although {{the case}} for trade {{liberalization}} is now well established, {{the case for}} financial liberalization is not, because the latter is associated with lending booms and crises. Some critics <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> evidence the recent weak growth of Mexico, a prominent liberalizer. We argue that liberalization is beneficial despite the occurrence of crises. First, we show that financial liberalization has typically followed trade liberalization, and that both have led to faster growth, despite more frequent booms and busts. Second, we present a model that shows why, in countries with severe credit market imperfections, liberalization leads to faster growth and, as a by-product, to financial fragility. Third, comparing Mexico with this international norm, we show that liberalization and NAFTA have induced faster growth and investment but have not been enough: lack of structural reform and a protracted credit crunch generated bottlenecks that blocked further growth {{and led to a}} slowdown in exports.

40|$|Serpentinization {{involves}} the hydrolysis and transformation of primary ferromagnesian minerals such as olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4) and pyroxenes ((Mg,Fe) SiO 3) to produce H 2 -rich fluids {{and a variety}} of secondary minerals over a wide range of environmental conditions. The continual and elevated production of H 2 is capable of reducing carbon, thus initiating an inorganic pathway to produce organic compounds. The production of H 2 and H 2 -dependent CH 4 in serpentinization systems has received significant interdisciplinary interest, especially with regard to the abiotic synthesis of organic compounds and the origins and maintenance of life in Earth’s lithosphere and elsewhere in the Universe. Here, serpentinization with an emphasis on the formation of H 2 and CH 4 are reviewed {{within the context of the}} mineralogy, temperature/pressure, and fluid/gas chemistry present in planetary environments. Whether deep in Earth’s interior or in Kuiper Belt Objects in space, serpentinization is a feasible process to <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> a means of producing astrobiologically indispensable H 2 capable of reducing carbon to organic compounds.

40|$|Rights talk dominates {{contemporary}} moral discourse. It is {{also having}} a growing {{impact on the}} development of legal principle and doctrine. One of the best known general arguments in support of rights-based moral theories is the one given by John Rawls, who claims that only rights-based theories take seriously the distinction between human beings; only they can be counted on to protect certain rights and interests that are so paramount that they are beyond the demands of net happiness (Rawls 1971). Charges and assertions of this nature have been extremely influential. After the Second World War, there was an immense increase in rights talk, both in the sheer volume of that talk and in the number of supposed rights being claimed. Rights doctrine has progressed a long way since its original modest aim of providing “a legitimization of … claims against tyrannical or exploiting regimes” (Benn 1978 : 61). As Tom Campbell points out: The human rights movement is based on the need for a counter-ideology to combat the abuses and misuses of political authority by those who <b>invoke,</b> <b>as</b> a justification for their activities, the need to subordinate the particular interests of individuals to the general good (Campbell 1996 : 13) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{arrival time}} {{distribution}} of the muon component of an extensive air shower (EAS) has been investigated under the aspect of mapping via time-of-flight the EAS longitudinal development. For the experimental studies and the analyses based on Monte Carlo simulations the {{arrival time distribution}}s have been characterised by the mean arrival time, the first quartile, the median and the third quartile of the single event distributions. Their correlations with other shower observables and their dependencies as functions of {{the distance from the}} shower axis, the zenith angle-of-incidence, the estimated primary energy and the muon multiplicity have been extensively studied. The measurements use the timing, trigger facilities and Multiwire Proportional Chamber system of the Central Detector of the KASCADE experimental configuration, enabling arrival time measurements for muons with a 2. 4 GeV energy threshold. In the present work the muon arrival time distributions have been experimentally studied relative to the first locally registered muon, in a radius interval of 20 / 110 m, for a zenith angle of the shower 0 / 40 at primary energies around the ''knee'' region of the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays. The Monte Carlo simulations (using the program CORSIKA vers. 5. 621) <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> generators various hadronic interaction models, in particular QGSJET and GHEISHA for the high energy and low energy range of the EAS particles, respectively.

40|$|As {{has been}} shown in S. Forrest's seminal work [1], there are Unix {{processes}} whose normal behavior can be modeled by a set of characteristic patterns, a pattern being a subsequence of system calls that a process can generate. Well-suited processes are network services such as ftpd or sendmail. Intrusion-detection systems that make use of this observation first need to build the table of characteristic patterns. The patterns are determined by letting the process <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> many subcommands as possible, then extracting the patterns from the corresponding sequences of system calls. During realtime operation, a pattern-matching algorithm is applied to match on the fly the system calls generated by the process examined with entries of the pattern table. Based on how well the matching can be done, it is decided whether the sequence of system calls represents normal or anomalous behavior. As an analysis of intrusion-detection systems that are based on the above concepts [1, 2, 3] reveals, these systems share the same main components, but they differ in the way the individual components are implemented. Furthermore, each system uses some implicit parameters that are based on experimental observations and may only be applicable to the test cases examined. In our presentation, we will give an overview of the various techniques to implement the individual components, and assess their impact on the detection capability of the intrusion-detection system. Specifically, we will discuss the following components: ?? Recording system calls: System calls can be recorded either by using a tool such as trace" or by activating the auditing system. The technique used may influence the overall system performance and the number of events recorded...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} the Moreton wave {{observed}} in the chromosphere and the EIT wave observed in the corona during the eruption remains being an active research subject for a while. We investigate numerically in this work the evolutionary features of the magnetic configuration that includes a current-carrying flux rope, {{which is used to}} model the filament, after the loss of equilibrium in the system takes place in a catastrophic fashion. Rapid motions of the flux rope following the catastrophe invokes the velocity vortices behind the rope, and may <b>invoke</b> <b>as</b> well slow and fast mode shocks in front of the rope. The velocity vortices at each side of the flux rope propagate roughly horizontally away from the area where it is produced, and both shocks expand toward the flank of the flux rope. The fast one may eventually reach the bottom boundary and produces two echoes moving back into the corona, but the slow one and the vortices totally decay somewhere in the lower corona before arriving the bottom boundary. The interaction of the fast shock with the boundary leads to disturbance that accounts for the Moreton wave observed in Halpha, and the disturbance in the corona caused by the slow shock and the velocity vortices should account for the EIT wave whose speed is about 40 % that of the Moreton wave. Implication of these results to the observed correlation of the type II radio burst to the fast and the slow mode shocks, and that of EIT waves to CMEs and flares have also been discussed.
