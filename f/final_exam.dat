5|$|Unfortunately, {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer is not {{prepared}} for his <b>final</b> <b>exam.</b> The nerds say {{the only way to}} pass is to cram for the <b>final</b> <b>exam,</b> which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but unfortunately, Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college experience is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E

He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.

5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his <b>final</b> <b>exam</b> for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E

40|$|In many {{engineering}} courses, cumulative <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> typically {{comprise the}} largest {{component of a}} student’s grade. However, from a learner’s perspective, <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> are frequently associated {{with high levels of}} stress, which may hinder student performance during the exam period. In this interactive engineering-focused workshop, I will discuss the challenges associated with <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> that are heavily- weighted and propose alternative forms of summative assessment of student learning. Through a demonstration of a survey conducted in a Civil Engineering class at the University of Waterloo, I will demonstrate students’ perspectives on <b>final</b> <b>exams.</b> Furthermore, using data from twenty-one engineering course outlines from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), I will demonstrate common assessment approaches used in engineering courses. The workshop will conclude by asking participants to share ideas for alternatives to heavily-weighted <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> and will introduce some alternative methods of assessment that have been suggested in education literature...|$|R
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the <b>final</b> <b>exam.</b> The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E
5|$|In the present, knight-in-training Link passes his <b>final</b> <b>exam</b> {{despite the}} {{attempted}} interference {{of his class}} rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend Zelda. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led to the island's statue of Hylia by Fi, {{the spirit of the}} Goddess Sword residing within the statue. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way to the Surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link is also confronted by Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, giving the two time to depart through a Time Gate into the past which Impa destroys as they pass through.|$|E
5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his <b>final</b> <b>exam</b> for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} a single School of a UK {{university}} to estimate {{the impact of a}} switch from end-of-semester to end-of-year <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> on student performance. The identification strategy exploits the fact that while the timing of <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> changed, the timing of mid-term exams remained the same. Estimates are based on a difference-in-differences methodology that compares <b>final</b> and mid-term <b>exam</b> scores after the switch, with <b>final</b> and mid-term <b>exam</b> scores before the switch. The empirical findings suggest that the shift of <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> {{to the end of the}} academic year had a negative effect on student achievement. Many changes in higher education are often done on the basis of financial, administrative or ideological considerations, underestimating the magnitude of their effect on student learning and student performance...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{behavioral}} approach system (BAS) dysregulation theory of bipolar disorder, this study examined the relation between occurrence of a BAS activation-relevant life event—goal striving—and onset of hypomanic and depressive episodes and symptoms. In particular, the authors examined the relation between preparing for and completing <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> (a goal-striving event) and onset of bipolar spectrum episodes and symptoms in college students with bipolar II disorder or cyclothymia (i. e., “soft” bipolar spectrum conditions). One hundred fifty-nine individuals with either a bipolar spectrum disorder (n 68) or no major affective psychopathology (controls; n 91) were further classified on {{the basis of}} whether they were college students (i. e., completed <b>final</b> <b>exams).</b> Consistent with the BAS dysregu-lation theory, preparing for and completing <b>final</b> <b>exams</b> was associated with an increase in hypomanic but not depressive episodes and symptoms in individuals with a soft bipolar spectrum diagnosis. Further-more, self-reported BAS sensitivity moderated the presence of certain hypomanic symptoms during <b>final</b> <b>exams...</b>|$|R
