40|$|Abstract Background <b>Functional</b> <b>modules</b> {{are basic}} units of cell function, and {{exploring}} them {{is important for}} understanding the organization, regulation and execution of cell processes. <b>Functional</b> <b>modules</b> in single biological networks (e. g., the protein-protein interaction network), have {{been the focus of}} recent studies. <b>Functional</b> <b>modules</b> in the integrated network are composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> which imply the complex relationships involving multiple biological interaction types, and detect them will help us understand the complexity of cell processes. Results We aimed to detect composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> containing co-transcriptional regulation interaction, and protein-protein interaction, in our pre-constructed integrated network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We computationally extracted 15 composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules,</b> and found structural consistency between co-transcriptional regulation interaction sub-network and protein-protein interaction sub-network that was well correlated with their functional hierarchy. This type of composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> was compact in structure, and was found to participate in essential cell processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and RNA splicing. Conclusions The structure of composite <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> containing co-transcriptional regulation interaction, and protein-protein interaction reflected the cooperation of transcriptional regulation and protein function implementation, and was indicative of their important roles in essential cell functions. In addition, their structural and functional characteristics were closely related, and suggesting the complexity of the cell regulatory system. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{molecular}} profiles {{exhibited in}} different cancer types are very different; hence, discovering distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> associated with specific cancer types {{is very important}} to understand the distinct functions associated with them. Protein-protein interaction networks carry vital information about molecular interactions in cellular systems, and identification of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> (subgraphs) in these networks {{is one of the most}} important applications of biological network analysis. Results. In this study, we developed a new graph theory based method to identify distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> from nine different cancer protein-protein interaction networks. The method is composed of three major steps: (i) extracting modules from protein-protein interaction networks using network clustering algorithms; (ii) identifying distinct subgraphs from the derived modules; and (iii) identifying distinct subgraph patterns from distinct subgraphs. The subgraph patterns were evaluated using experimentally determined cancer-specific protein-protein interaction data from the Ingenuity knowledgebase, to identify distinct <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> that are specific to each cancer type. Conclusion. We identified cancer-type specific subgraph patterns that may represent the <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> involved in the molecular pathogenesis of different cancer types.

40|$|Towards the {{identification}} of protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> by integrating PPI network and gene expression data Min Li 1, 2 *, Xuehong Wu 1, Jianxin Wang 1 * and Yi Pan 1, 3 * Background: Identification of protein complexes and <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is crucial to understanding the principles of cellular organization and predicting protein functions. In the past few years, many computational methods have been proposed. However, most of them considered the PPI networks as static graphs and overlooked the dynamics inherent within these networks.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and biological {{significance of the}} study of fungal pathogen Candida albicans (C. albicans) has markedly increased. However, the explicit pathogenic and invasive mechanisms of such host-pathogen interactions have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the essential <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> involved in C. albicans-zebrafish interactions were investigated in this study. Adopting a systems biology approach, the early-stage and late-stage protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for both C. albicans and zebrafish were constructed. By comparing PPI networks at the early and late stages of the infection process, several critical <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> were identified in both pathogenic and defensive mechanisms. <b>Functional</b> <b>modules</b> in C. albicans, like those involved in hyphal morphogenesis, ion and small molecule transport, protein secretion, and shifts in carbon utilization, were seen to play important roles in pathogen invasion and damage caused to host cells. Moreover, the <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> in zebrafish, such as those involved in immune response, apoptosis mechanisms, ion transport, protein secretion, and hemostasis-related processes, were found to be significant as defensive mechanisms during C. albicans infection. The essential <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> thus determined could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions during the infection process and thereby devise potential therapeutic strategies to treat C. albicans infection...|$|R
50|$|A common way to {{demonstrate}} modularity {{is to find}} a double dissociation. That is two groups: First, people for whom language is severely damaged and yet have normal cognitive abilities and, second, persons for whom normal cognitive abilities are grossly impaired and yet language remains intact. Whilst extensive lesions in the left hemisphere perisylvian area can render persons unable to produce or perceive language (global aphasia), there is no known acquired case where language is completely intact in the face of severe non-linguistic deterioration. Thus, <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> status cannot be granted to language processing based on this evidence.|$|E
50|$|The {{available}} evidence points towards no one anatomical area solely devoted to processing language. The Wada test, where sodium amobarbital {{is used to}} anaesthetise one hemisphere, shows that the left-hemisphere appears to be crucial in language processing. Yet, neuroimaging does not implicate any single area but rather identifies many different areas as being involved in different aspects of language processing (Raichle, 1998) {{and not just in}} the left hemisphere. Further, individual areas appear to subserve a number of different functions (Raichle, 1998). Thus, the extent to which language processing occurs within an anatomical module is considered to be minimal. Nevertheless, as many have suggested, modular processing can still exist even when implemented across the brain; that is, language processing could occur within a <b>functional</b> <b>module.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cognitive Neuropsychology studies {{brain damaged}} {{patients}} {{and uses the}} patterns of selective impairment {{in order to make}} inferences on the underlying cognitive structure. Dissociation between cognitive functions is taken to be evidence that these functions are independent. Theorists have identified several key assumptions that are needed to justify these inferences:1) Functional Modularity- the mind is organized into functionally separate cognitive modules.2). Anatomical Modularity- the brain is organized into functionally separate modules. This assumption is very similar to the assumption of functional localization. These assumptions differ from the assumption of functional modularity, because it is possible to have separable cognitive modules that are implemented by diffuse patterns of brain activation.3)Universality- The basic organization of functional and anatomical modularity is the same for all normal humans. This assumption is needed if we are to make any claim about functional organization based on dissociation that extrapolates from the instance of a case study to the population.4) Transparency / Subtractivity- the mind does not undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage. It is possible to remove one <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> without significantly altering the overall structure of the system. This assumption is necessary in order to justify using brain damaged patients in order to make inferences about the cognitive architecture of healthy people.|$|E

5000|$|The theory (for which {{empirical}} support {{has yet to}} be developed) states that in each <b>functional</b> <b>module</b> of the visual cortex, Fourier analysis is performed on the receptive field and the neurons in each module are thought to respond selectively to various orientations and frequencies of sine wave gratings. When all of the visual cortex neurons that are influenced by a specific scene respond together, the perception of the scene is created by the summation of the various sine-wave gratings. (This procedure, however, does not address the problem of the organization of the products of the summation into figures, grounds, and so on. It effectively recovers the original (pre-Fourier analysis) distribution of photon intensity and wavelengths across the retinal projection, but does not add information to this original distribution. So the functional value of such a hypothesized procedure is unclear. Some other objections to the [...] "Fourier theory" [...] are discussed by Westheimer (2001) [...] ). One is generally not aware of the individual spatial frequency components since all of the elements are essentially blended together into one smooth representation. However, computer-based filtering procedures can be used to deconstruct an image into its individual spatial frequency components. Research on spatial frequency detection by visual neurons complements and extends previous research using straight edges rather than refuting it.|$|E

40|$|Classically, the {{functional}} consequences {{of natural selection}} over genomes have been analyzed as the compound effects of individual genes. The current paradigm for large-scale analysis of adaptation {{is based on the}} observed significant deviations of rates of individual genes from neutral evolutionary expectation. This approach, which assumed independence among genes, {{has not been able to}} identify biological functions significantly enriched in positively selected genes in individual species. Alternatively, pooling related species has enhanced the search for signatures of selection. However, grouping signatures does not allow testing for adaptive differences between species. Here we introduce the Gene-Set Selection Analysis (GSSA), a new genome-wide approach to test for evidences of natural selection on <b>functional</b> <b>modules.</b> GSSA is able to detect lineage specific evolutionary rate changes in a notable number of <b>functional</b> <b>modules.</b> For example, in nine mammal and Drosophilae genomes GSSA identifies hundreds of <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> with significant associations to high and low rates of evolution. Many of the detected <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> with high evolutionary rates have been previously identified as biological functions under positive selection. Notably, GSSA identifies conserved <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> with many positively selected genes, which questions whether they are exclusively selected for fitting genomes to environmental changes. Our results agree with previous studies suggesting that adaptation requires positive selection, but not every mutation under positive selection contributes to the adaptive dynamical process of the evolution of species...|$|R

40|$|Graph {{clustering}} algorithms {{are widely}} used {{in the analysis of}} biological networks. Extracting <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is one such use. Most clustering algorithms whose focuses are on finding <b>functional</b> <b>modules</b> try either to find a clique like sub networks or to grow clusters starting from vertices with high degrees as seeds.
