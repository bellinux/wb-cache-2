500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team. We {{have a really good}} car, we just had to learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after the}} race, Kanaan credited his team's fuel strategy {{for being the}} main factor in his victory. During many of the laps that Wheldon led, Kanaan drafted behind him to use less gasoline than normal, {{and he was able}} to stay on the track longer than other drivers as a result. He said of the strategy, [...] "that's what probably gave me the win." [...] On the other hand, Wheldon later said that his radio problem forced more [...] "conservative" [...] pit stop planning by himself and his team. Third-place finisher Franchitti said: [...] "We had to take the gamble to try to get the win. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> as good a car as TK (Tony Kanaan) and Dan (Wheldon). I think I could have hung with them, but I don't think I could have caught up with them." [...] Matsuura admitted his first-lap accident was his fault and apologized to his Japanese fans. After his accident on the 135th lap, Andretti was taken to the track's infield care center for a precautionary X-ray scan of his right shoulder which showed a negative result. He said that he struggled with controlling his car but was happy. With his second-place finish, Wheldon gained the season points lead with 188, three ahead of Kanaan and 17 in front of Dixon. The standings were closely contested, with the top six drivers separated by 27 points.|$|E
2500|$|With 3:35 left to play, Iowa {{attempted}} a trick play – an attempted flanker pass that has posed problems for Texas all season. [...] Safety Marcus Griffin stuffed the play for an 11-yard loss. [...] Commenting on stopping the trick play, Griffin said, [...] "I {{knew it was}} coming – we'd been beaten by that play in the last 10 games. We knew it had to come, I guess that was the best time for it." [...] Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz described the call as [...] "totally my fault. I was being greedy, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a secure play." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "It {{just sort}} of happened," [...] said Amos. [...] "It started with Kels, Tash’s older cousin. Kels has been singing for years and is in {{performing}} arts school in Boston. She has a really big instrument. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do something together that works. ‘Candle: Coventry Carol’ in itself is an ancient song, and I thought it would lend itself to that. And then Tash was thinking {{she wanted to do}} a bawdy song. And I said no. She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with {{the scene in}} which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically {{for the next ten}} months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he [...] "saw this roller-coaster, and... saw the house under it. And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to use this." [...] Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.|$|R
