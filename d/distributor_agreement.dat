Exports to Chile commenced in 1994, and almost 3,000 Protons were sold here {{prior to the}} company's departure in 1998. However, Proton later expressed intentions of returning to Chile following the ratification of the Malaysia-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2012.

The latter contained arbitration clauses requiring that any disputes under them be arbitrated in Japan under the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (JCAA).

25|$|In July 2015, Proton {{signed a}} <b>distributor</b> <b>agreement</b> with Chile-based Andes Motor, {{and the first}} {{left-hand}} drive Prevé and Exora evaluation units were shipped to Chile in November. On 1 March 2016, Proton commenced the first official shipment of 50 Prevé units, the first of an anticipated 1,000 Chilean bound Protons this year. The Chilean launch of the Proton Prevé commenced in May 2016 as planned. Three variants are available, namely Standard, Executive and Premium, ranging from $10,490 to $14,490. Both Standard and Executive variants are fitted with the 107hp CamPro IAFM+ engine and a five-speed manual transmission. The range topping Premium is equipped with the 138hp CamPro CFE/Turbo, paired to the updated ProTronic VT3+ CVT from the Suprima S. The Standard and Executive lines are only fitted with dual front airbags, while the Premium model offers additional twin side and twin curtain airbags. Nonetheless, Electronic Stability Control is standard on all Chilean market Prevés, along with a 5-year/150,000km warranty. The launch of the Prevé in Chile marks Proton's return to the market after an 18-year hiatus. Chile is currently Proton's only South American export market, and the first and thus far only country to receive the left-hand drive Prevé.|$|E

40|$|How an {{exporter}} {{can effectively}} craft a <b>distributor</b> <b>agreement</b> that encourages its network of foreign distributors {{to respond in}} pro-relational ways? This {{is an important issue}} as previous research has shown that relationship quality was linked to export performance. However, research failed to propose managerial tools that allowed exporters to foster relational phenomena in cross-border relationships. In this study, we suggest that exporters can influence importers' attitudes and behaviors with relational incentives policies. We also show that the impact of these policies is impervious to the noise, i. e., psychic distance and information asymmetry, that characterizes international business relationships. Our hypotheses are tested via structural equations modeling with data from a sample of French exporters...|$|E
40|$|Peer reviewedThis paper {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} the distribution channel of the Australian Information Communication Technology (ICT) industry over a 21 year period, introducing an effectiveness of the methods used to investigate this. The paper opens with a discussion of the value of historical analysis, arguing that ‘applying history helps us by identifying the reasons for important transitions’. A historical focus both allows us to interpret the past via the identification of key events that triggered change; and by considering the patterns that these form; we are able to surmise the impact of present and future events. The practical problems associated with extended longitudinal research have been well documented and include substantial resources required, drop out, poor choice of focus (as one cannot foresee if research subjects will evolve in ways of interest to the researchers), etc. This paper illustrates an effective way of overcoming at least some of these problems by using archival material in combination with narrative event analysis and any necessary clarification and augmentation provided via depth interviews with industry experts. Narrative event analysis enables consideration of the important explanations that can emerge from considering timing, order and interaction of events over simple correlation between variables. The analysis enables consideration of ‘moving pictures’ of networks as they evolve rather than only static pictures. The analysis of archival data avoids problems of imperfect recall and because the material used (articles in trade journals published during the review period) is from the perspective of many different observers, we also avoid dependence on the perspectives and interpretations of only a few observers. The paper focuses on a description of the classification and coding of the archival data for events using structural conditions topography. One of the key findings is that the following mechanisms/conditions are appropriate for classification and interrelating of the processes and the events of the channel’s evolution. Market conditions which relate to preferred structure of the optimum channel network, size of market, industry growth, competition relating to number of vendors and distribution partners in the channel, long term strategic trends and the frequency of mergers and acquisitions were important drivers. Product conditions are connected to market conditions and these play a particularly important role in the information technology market where there is a constant emergence of new products and technology with products superseding other products and with short product life-cycles. Influence conditions (i. e. social mechanisms) are concerned responses to product and market conditions, in particular with how vendor distributor relationships are managed by vendor distributor management. This involves fit in terms of organisation culture and expectations between vendor and distributor, fit of personality of account manager on vendor distributor side, inter personal skills of account manager, communication frequency, interpersonal skills and how conflicts are managed. Commercial agreement conditions (risk/return profile of distribution) are the final key mechanism. This relates to the vendor commercial <b>distributor</b> <b>agreement,</b> basic functions, channel strategy, nature of commercial relationship, performance targets and formal reporting. The paper presents a portion of the analysis of the archival data using this frame to show the interrelationships of these four categories. Structural conditions {{have a significant impact on}} the structural evolution of the channel and on the relationships within the channel of distribution. Structural evolution is driven in part by market conditions. Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in increased channel consolidation and the emergence of fewer channel partners and this has moved the relationship processes from high conflict and adversarial to highly collaborative forms – though these do often include considerable conflict. Product conditions relating to convergence of new product technology over time have also impacted on channel structure expanding the channel further into retail and online alternatives. However this greater complexity of tasks (in conjunction with adversarial history) has resulted in the need for increasing levels of channel coordination to manage and resolve the considerable conflicts that continue to emerge. Evolution of commercial conditions has resulted in more professionalism and a formalised partner planning process which in turn is impacting on the influence conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of further development of this methodology and the further analysis that will be undertaken. The symposium is organised on behalf of AAHANZBS by the Business and Labour History Group, The University of Sydney, with the financial support of the University’s Faculty of Economics and Business...|$|E
