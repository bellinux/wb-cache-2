40|$|Background: <b>Fistulae</b> are {{a common}} {{complication}} in up to 35 % of all patients with Crohn’s disease. Their therapy is difficult and frequently unsatisfactory.

40|$|The outcome among 39 {{patients}} with enterocutaneous <b>fistulae</b> complicating Crohn's disease has been reviewed. The patients were considered in two groups: (1) no disease - all were early postoperative <b>fistulae</b> (n = 9); (2) active disease (i) without abscess formation (n = 16), (ii) with abscess formation (n = 14). Postoperative <b>fistulae</b> with {{no evidence of}} active Crohn's disease healed spontaneously. <b>Fistulae</b> {{in the presence of}} active disease did not heal even with prolonged medical management. The only effective treatment was excision of the diseased segment from which the <b>fistulae</b> arose and any distal obstruction. None of the <b>fistulae</b> closed surgically has recurred...|$|R
5|$|The {{growth or}} proliferative phase, {{during which the}} body {{produces}} cells and protein to heal the puncture and the edges contract around the piercing, forming a tunnel of scar tissue called a <b>fistula.</b> This phase may last weeks, months, or longer than a year.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate <b>fistula)</b> or esophagus (tracheoesophageal <b>fistula).</b> Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (<b>fistula)</b> allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End <b>Fistula,</b> which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric <b>Fistula</b> every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no records}} of {{diseases}} experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness {{dates from the}} time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the Consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel Gorman from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. He was treated with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal <b>fistula</b> in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation over his own personal health. The <b>fistula</b> would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size.|$|E

In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia <b>fistula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal <b>fistula</b> – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea.

Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E
40|$|The commonest {{complication}} of hypospadias repair is occurrence of urethrocutaneous <b>fistulae.</b> These <b>fistulae</b> {{may be caused}} by a variety of factors and occur in different sizes at various sites of the previous repair. Small <b>fistulae</b> are easier to close with local tissue and flaps but larger <b>fistulae</b> which are 4 mm or more in size are difficult to close because of the paucity of available tissues and chances of recurrence. A variety of methods have been described in the literature for the repair of urethrocutaneous <b>fistulae</b> with variable results. In this study of 23 cases, we have successfully repaired large urethrocutaneous <b>fistulae</b> using dartos-based flip flaps for their closure in the period from June 2001 to May 2006.

40|$|<b>Fistulas</b> are {{abnormal}} {{communications between}} two epithelialized surfaces. <b>Fistulas</b> of the gas-trointestinal (GI) tract can be subdivided further as internal, consisting of an abnormal opening be-tween adjacent hollow viscera, or external (enterocutaneous [ECI), referring to an abnormal communication between hollow viscera and the skin. <b>Fistulas</b> most commonly occur after an opera-tion or instrumentation. Spontaneous causes of <b>fistulas</b> include irradiation, {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), diverticular disease, ischemic bowel, appendicitis, perforation of duodenal ulcer, and gastrointestinal and gynecologic malignancy. Major complications of EC <b>fistulas</b> include fluid and electrolyte losses, sepsis, and malnutrition. Since the advent of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) the mortality of enterocutaneous <b>fistulas</b> has decreased significantly.

40|$|Background. Radiotherapy {{is a basic}} {{treatment}} for patients with locally advanced cancer of the cervix uteri (CCU). However, in 20 – 30 % of patients, postradiation injuries result from different causes, which may give rise to <b>fistulas.</b> Objective: to define an optimal surgical rehabilitation method for patients with postradiation vesicovaginal <b>fistulas</b> in CCU. Subjects and methods. Forty-eight patients with CCU and postradiation vesicovaginal <b>fistulas</b> were operated on in 1996 to 2010. Patients with primary <b>fistulas</b> underwent 46 radical operations and 2 palliative ones; those with recurrent <b>fistulas</b> had 17 radical operations and 1 palliative one. Results. Recurrences after radical surgery for primary <b>fistulas</b> occurred in 39. 1 % of the patients; the efficiency was 80. 0 % for transvaginal plasty, 61. 5 % for bladder resection, 61. 5 % for bladder resection with ureteral reimplantation, and 0 for subtotal bladder resection. In recurrent <b>fistulas,</b> the efficiency was 0 for bladder resection with ureteral reimplantation, 50 % for subtotal bladder resection, and 100 % for cystectomy, Bricker surgery. Surgical rehabilitation could be achieved {{in a total of}} 40 (83. 3 %) of the 48 women. Conclusion.
