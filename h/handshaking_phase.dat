Richard Watson in 1981 {{provided a}} fundamental theory of reliable transport, whereby connection management requires only timers bounded {{by a small}} factor of the Maximum Packet Lifetime (MPL). Based on this theory, Watson et al. developed the Delta-t protocol [...] {{in which the state}} of a connection at the sender and receiver can be safely removed once the connection-state timers expire without the need for explicit removal messages. And new connections are established without an explicit <b>handshaking</b> <b>phase.</b> On the other hand, TCP uses both explicit handshaking as well as more limited timer-based management of the connection’s state. Had TCP incorporated Watson's results it would be more efficient, robust and secure, eliminating the use of SYNs and FINs and therefore all the associated complexities and vulnerabilities to attack (such as SYN flood).|$|E

However, very {{little is known about}} the (in) accuracy of the various methods used in these tools. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of ten HTTP-based and TCP socket-based methods for measuring the round-trip time (RTT) with the five most popular browsers on Linux and Windows. Our measurement results show that the delay overheads incurred in most of the HTTP-based methods are too large to ignore. Moreover, the overheads incurred by some methods (such as Flash GET and POST) vary significantly across different browsers and systems, making it very difficult to calibrate. The socket-based methods, on the other hand, incur much smaller overhead. Another interesting and important finding is that Date. getTime(), a typical timing API in Java, does not provide the millisecond resolution assumed by many measurement tools on some OSes (e. g., Windows 7). This results in a serious under-estimation of RTT. On the other hand, some tools over-estimate the RTT by including the TCP <b>handshaking</b> <b>phase.</b> Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E

In this paper the physical characteristics of handshakes between humans are deeply analyzed using the wavelet transforms to reproduce future experiments of handshakes between a human and a robot. A special pair of data gloves {{has been designed to}} measure acceleration patterns of human arms during handshakes. Most energy of an acceleration signal reached by wavelet coefficients is concentrated within the time range of the Physical Contact phase and a Mutual Synchrony phase, with scale range corresponding to the durations of wavelet components from 0. 5 to 2 s.

40|$|The {{problem of}} obtaining the {{transmission}} rate {{in an ad}} hoc network consists in adjusting the power of each node to ensure the signal to interference ratio (SIR) and the energy required to transmit from one node to another is obtained at the same time. Therefore, an optimal transmission rate for each node in a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on CSMA-CDMA (carrier sense multiple access-code division multiple access) for ad hoc networks can be obtained using evolutionary optimization. This work proposes a genetic algorithm for the transmission rate election considering a perfect power control, and our proposition achieves improvement of 10 % compared with the scheme that handles the <b>handshaking</b> <b>phase</b> to adjust the transmission rate. Furthermore, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm that solves the problem of power combining, interference, data rate, and energy ensuring the signal to interference ratio in an ad hoc network. The result of the proposed genetic algorithm has a better performance (15 %) compared to the CSMA-CDMA protocol without optimizing.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of {{connection}} management for reliable transport. At one extreme, a pure soft-state (SS) approach (as in Delta-t [9]) safely removes the state of a connection at the sender and receiver once the state timers expire {{without the need for}} explicit removal messages. And new connections are established without an explicit <b>handshaking</b> <b>phase.</b> On the other hand, a hybrid hard-state/soft-state (HS+SS) approach (as in TCP) uses both explicit handshaking as well as timer-based management of the connection’s state. In this paper, we consider the worst-case scenario of reliable single-message communication, and develop a common analytical model that can be instantiated to capture either the SS approach or the HS+SS approach. We compare the two approaches in terms of goodput, message and state overhead. We also use simulations to compare against other approaches, and evaluate them in terms of correctness (with respect to data loss and duplication) and robustness to bad network conditions (high message loss rate and variable channel delays). Our results show that the SS approach is more robust, and has lower message overhead. On the other hand, SS requires more memory to keep connection states, which reduces goodput. Given memories are getting bigger and cheaper, SS presents the best choice over bandwidth-constrained, error-prone networks. I...|$|E

Thus, SS presents the best choice for reliable applications, especially those operating over bandwidth-constrained, error-prone networks. This result also suggests that within a clean-slate transport architecture, explicit connection messages for data reliability are not needed, and so a simple common packet interface based on Delta-t—rather than TCP vs. T/TCP vs. UDP, etc. — can be provided to support both transactional and bulk, reliable and unreliable (unacknowledged) applications. 1...|$|E
