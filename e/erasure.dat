Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the <b>erasure</b> of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's <b>erasure</b> and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E

Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and <b>Erasure,</b> helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
40|$|NAND flash {{memories}} are currently {{the most widely}} used flash memories. In a NAND flash memory, although a cell block consists of many pages, to rewrite one page, the whole block needs to be erased and reprogrammed. Block <b>erasures</b> determine the longevity and efficiency of flash memories. So when data is frequently reorganized, which can be characterized as a data movement process, how to minimize block <b>erasures</b> becomes an important challenge. In this paper, we show that coding can significantly reduce block <b>erasures</b> for data movement, and present several optimal or nearly optimal algorithms. While the sorting-based non-coding schemes require O(n log n) <b>erasures</b> to move data among n blocks, coding-based schemes use only O(n) <b>erasures</b> and also optimize the utilization of storage space...|$|R

Our main {{result is that the}} ERC constructed from an affine space with block size q— a special Steiner 2 -design—cannot only correct up to any q <b>erasures</b> but even up to any 2 q− 1 <b>erasures</b> except for a small set of so-called bad <b>erasures</b> if q is a power of some odd prime number.

And in case of more than 1 error, this decoder outputs 28 <b>erasures.</b> The deinterlever at the succeeding stage distributes these <b>erasures</b> across 28 D2 codewords. Again in most solutions, D2 is set to deal with <b>erasures</b> only (a simpler and less expensive solution). If more than 4 <b>erasures</b> were to be encountered, 24 <b>erasures</b> are output by D2. Thereafter, an error concealment system attempts to interpolate (from neighboring symbols) in case of uncorrectable symbols, failing which sounds corresponding to such erroneous symbols get muted.|$|R

5|$|The BBC Film Library, meanwhile, had no {{responsibility}} for storing programmes that had not originated on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes. As each body believed it the other's responsibility to archive the material, each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary. This lack of communication contributed to the <b>erasure</b> {{of much of the}} Corporation's film archive of older black-and-white programming. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world, the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, <b>erasure,</b> commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Derrida's {{concepts of the}} metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and <b>erasure,</b> embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing {{found their way into}} deconstructivist memorials. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of concrete poetry. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and <b>erasure</b> were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the Jewish Museum Berlin. The museum is conceived as a trace of the <b>erasure</b> of the Holocaust, intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Peter Eisenman's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe are also said to reflect themes of trace and <b>erasure.</b>|$|E
