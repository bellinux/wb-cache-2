5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E

From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|In May 1988, Gingrich (along with 77 other House {{members and}} Common Cause) brought ethics charges against Democratic Speaker Jim Wright, who was {{alleged to have}} used a book deal to {{circumvent}} campaign-finance laws and House ethics rules.

Gingrich's success in forcing Wright's resignation contributed to his rising influence in the Republican caucus.|$|E
5|$|The Mercians, {{who participated}} in Edwin's defeat in 633, seem to have {{presented}} an obstacle to Oswald's authority south of the Humber, {{although it has been}} generally thought that Oswald dominated Mercia to some degree after Heavenfield.
