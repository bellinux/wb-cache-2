5|$|It is {{expected}} that {{the definition of the}} kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> by the CGPM in November 2018. The new definition will use only invariant quantities of nature: the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the caesium hyperfine frequency.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} surrounding Roy Oswalt's nomination because {{he only had}} a 7–5 record {{at the time of}} nominations making him the only pitcher without eight wins nominated. However, he is {{considered by many to be}} the victim of lack of run support, questionable relief pitching and an average defense. This respect was shown by the players who had voted him to sixth place among National League starting pitchers making him the first alternate in case of injury to any of the five elected All-star starting pitchers. On the final day of All-Star <b>Final</b> <b>Vote</b> voting, it was announced that Oswalt (who was running third in the All-Star <b>Final</b> <b>Vote)</b> would replace John Smoltz who withdrew from All-Star game participation due to injury.|$|E

5|$|After the rosters were announced, {{a second}} round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star <b>Final</b> <b>Vote,</b> was {{commenced}} to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} {{drew to a}} close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher faced no major-party {{opposition}} in his re-election bid in 2002 after the only Democrat in the race, 24-year-old Roy Miller Cornett Jr., withdrew his candidacy. Independent Gatewood Galbraith again made the race; Libertarian Mark Gailey also mounted a challenge. In the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> tally, Fletcher received 115,522 votes to Galbraith's 41,853 and Gailey's 3,313.|$|E

5|$|Longoria was {{the first}} third baseman and second rookie to win the <b>Final</b> <b>Vote.</b> Hart's victory marked the third time that a club had a winning {{representative}} more than once; Geoff Jenkins (also from the Milwaukee Brewers) was elected in 2003. The other two clubs to have achieved this are the Red Sox (Damon, Varitek and Okajima) and the White Sox (Podsednik and Pierzynski).|$|E
5|$|Once Barroso {{put forward}} the {{candidates}} {{for his next}} Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee Rumiana Jeleva was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only {{had the support of}} the EPP which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> further).|$|E
5|$|The <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> {{has come}} under much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E

The final results were announced with ordinal vote rankings (shown below) and approximate winning vote totals (Hideki Matsui – 1.2 million, Bobby Abreu – 2 million, of more than 9.5 million votes). Abreu appeared as a pinch hitter, while Matsui both pinch hit and played left field.|$|E
5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located {{on the same side of}} Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E

5000|$|The top ten {{of a year}} {{is allowed}} for the <b>final</b> <b>voting</b> with bonus points (1st place - 10, 2nd - 9, ..., 10th - 1). Besides, the players who are trapped in the top 5 of a month at least once and got some bonus points (1st place - 5, 2nd - 4, ..., 5th - 1) are allowed to the <b>final</b> year <b>voting.</b> This ensures the {{objectivity}} of the competition - the players who played more consistently during a year (and not only last {{few months before the}} <b>final</b> <b>voting)</b> get additional promotion, in traditional polls the one wins more often who proved to be brighter than others at the finish, as recent events are more memorable.|$|R
5|$|Nebula Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, with the six works that receive the most nominations forming the final ballot. Additional nominees are possible in the case of ties. Members then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, though they can decline nominations. Ties in the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.|$|E
5|$|On the Sunday evening {{nine days}} before the {{scheduled}} All-Star game, the rosters are announced and the All-Star <b>Final</b> <b>Vote</b> nominees are announced on a nationally broadcast show. The voting commences after {{the announcement of the}} nominees {{toward the end of the}} show, and continues for a prescribed number of days. Generally, a single daily update of the ballot standings is released during the voting. After voting concludes, the top vote-getter for each league is announced. Over the course of the seven years of the voting, over 100 million votes have been cast.|$|E
5|$|The Dashnaktsutiun held {{a meeting}} on April 26, 1907, dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as Aram Manukian, Hamo Ohanjanyan and Stepan Stepanian {{discussed}} their engagement in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, {{human rights and the}} interests of all working people. They also felt that it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.|$|E

5|$|After a {{technical}} {{evaluation of the}} nine original bids, the top five were shortlisted on 18 May 2004, becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig and Rio de Janeiro—were eliminated. Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> approached. On 6 July 2005, in a four-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC (gathered at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore), Moscow, New York City and Madrid were eliminated {{in the first three}} rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>final</b> <b>vote,</b> Parliament {{demanded a}} number of {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-lead international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of delegation heads and special representatives for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the High Representative. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the <b>final</b> <b>vote</b> came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
