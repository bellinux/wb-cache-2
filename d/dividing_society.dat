40|$|International audienceThe {{academic}} literature on <b>divided</b> <b>societies</b> {{emerged from the}} study of colonial societies that were characterized by sharp and persistent cleavage along ethnic lines, and the study of consociational democracies in which there are power-sharing arrangements between two or more groups in an ethnically segmented society. The study of <b>divided</b> <b>societies</b> emerged historically at a moment when there was a growing interest in the study of immigration and inter-ethnic relations in developed industrial nations. These two sets of literature [...] on <b>divided</b> <b>societies</b> and on immigration and inter-ethnic relations [...] have developed largely in isolation from each other. Both sets of literature have also tended to focus on inter-ethnic relations, and have paid much less attention to migration. In this article, it is argued {{that there are a number}} of reasons why it is worth trying to encourage dialogue across these two sets of literature. In making the case: what is meant by the term <b>divided</b> <b>society</b> is examined; some of the ways in which the issue of migration has changed in three different <b>divided</b> <b>societies</b> [...] Bosnia, Northern Ireland and South Africa [...] are outlined; the topic of immigration and integration is examined; and some ways in which the study of <b>divided</b> <b>societies</b> might benefit from engaging more seriously with the literature on migration are suggested...|$|R

2500|$|In February 1896, the Munich {{publisher}} Hugo Bruckmann, {{a leading}} völkisch activist who was later to publish Mein Kampf commissioned Chamberlain {{to write a}} book that was intended to summarize all of the achievements of the 19th century. In October 1899 Chamberlain published his most famous work, Die Grundlagen des Neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, in German. The Foundations [...] are a pseudo-scientific [...] "racial history" [...] of humanity from the emergence of the first civilizations in the ancient Near East to the year 1800, and argued that all of the [...] "foundations" [...] of the great 19th century which saw huge economic, scientific and technological advances in the West were the work of the [...] "Aryan race". Die Grundlagen [...] was only the first volume of an intended three-volume history of the West with the second and third volumes taking up the story of the West in the 19th century and the looming war for world domination in the coming 20th century between the Aryans on one side vs. the Jews, blacks and Asians on the other side. Chamberlain never wrote the second or third volumes, much to the intense annoyance of Cosima Wagner who was upset that Die Grundlagen [...] stopped in 1800 before Wagner was born, and thus gave her late husband short shift. The book argued that Western civilisation is deeply marked by the influence of Teutonic peoples. Chamberlain grouped all European peoples – not just Germans, but Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins – into the [...] "Aryan race," [...] a race built on the ancient Proto-Indo-European culture. In fact he even included the Berber people of North Africa in the Aryan race: [...] "The noble Moor of Spain is anything but a pure Arab of the desert, he is half a Berber (from the Aryan family) and his veins are so full of Gothic blood that even at the present day noble inhabitants of Morocco can trace their descent back to Teutonic ancestors." [...] At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, according to Chamberlain, were the Germanic or Teutonic peoples, who had best preserved the Aryan blood. Chamberlain used the terms Aryan, Indo-European and Indo-Germanic interchangeably, but he {{went out of his way}} to emphasise that purest Aryans were to be found in Central Europe and that in both France and Russia miscegenation had diluted the Aryan blood. The Russians in particular had become a semi-Asian people on the account of the rule of the Golden Horde. Much of Chamberlain's theory about the superiority of the Aryan race was taken from the writings of the French aristocrat Arthur de Gobineau, but there was a crucial difference in that Gobineau had used the Aryan race theory as a way of <b>dividing</b> <b>society</b> between an Aryan nobility vs. racially inferior commoners whereas Chamberlain used the Aryan racial theory as a way of uniting society around its supposed common racial origins.|$|E
60|$|Miller was bothered, while I felt a {{disposition}} to laugh. One of the commonest errors of those who, from position and habits, {{are unable to}} appreciate the links which connect cultivated society together, is to refer everything to riches. Riches, in a certain sense, as a means and through their consequences, may be a principal agent in <b>dividing</b> <b>society</b> into classes; but, long after riches have taken wings, their fruits remain, when good use {{has been made of}} their presence. So untrue is the vulgar opinion--or it might be better to say the opinion of the vulgar--that money is the one tie which unites polished society, that it is a fact which all must know who have access to the better circles of even our own commercial towns, that those circles, loosely and accidentally constructed as they are, receive with reluctance, nay, often sternly exclude, vulgar wealth from their associations, while the door is open to the cultivated who have nothing. The young, in particular, seldom think much of money, while family connections, early communications, similarity of opinions, and, most of all, of tastes, bring sets together, and often keep them together long after the golden band has been broken.|$|E

50|$|Woodbey {{argues that}} capital like {{the tools and}} {{machines}} for work are created by labor, so a capitalist who is not producing anything for society but rather exploiting {{the production of the}} laborers is further separating the classes of society so that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, further <b>dividing</b> <b>society.</b> Capitalism also creates an economy in which a limited number of individuals can be successful. Saving one’s wages could be a way to better their station in society, but as the economy is powered by spending, saving is not effective if the majority do it because it eliminates the market for what they are producing.|$|E

5000|$|In the Chesapeake Bay region {{during the}} 17th century, three {{different}} ethnic communities coexisted: the English settlers, who were politically, militarily and economically dominant, the African Americans, who were primarily {{slaves in the}} service of wealthy English plantation owners, and the Native American groups, who were being increasingly marginalised. Amongst all three of these groups, the smoking of tobacco was common, and all three groups had histories of using clay pipes to smoke the drug. Within 17th-century Chesapeake Bay, there was a significant amount of cooperation and interaction between the members of these different communities, for instance the last pocket of resistance during Bacon's Rebellion of 1676 was recorded as consisting of [...] "eighty Negroes and twenty English" [...] who were cooperating to oppose the Virginia governorship. It would only be in the 18th century that the concept of firmly <b>dividing</b> <b>society</b> up into ethnic groups became acceptable in the region, when laws preventing inter-ethnic marriage were introduced.|$|E
