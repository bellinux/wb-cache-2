40|$|Abstract: Cleaner blowers play an {{important}} role in the proper functioning of fluffs collection system for industries. In this paper an <b>industrial</b> <b>blower</b> with three different volute geometries is investigated by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). And then two new volute geometries are modeled and analyzed based on the air flow through the blower. The numerical investigation revealed that the blowers with modified volute geometries have better outlet velocities. For this work, volute is modeled using Solid Works and meshed in ICEM CFD. The post processing is carried out using CFD POST. The results obtained were then validated and compared the experimental values of the different models of the blowers.

40|$|The {{recently}} concluded EC FP 7 IDEALVENT {{project has}} seen {{the application of a}} variety of simulation methods by the consortium partners to an <b>industrial</b> <b>blower</b> unit such as used in aircraft Environmental Control Systems. The blower was subjected to different inflow conditions in order to better comprehend the importance of installation effects, and assess the capabilities of the proposed numerical tools to quantify those effects. The prediction tools include scale-resolved, statistical, stochastic and semi-analytical approaches. The predicted acoustic fields were validated by comparison with experimental data obtained on a dedicated test rig, permitting the necessary decontamination of the microphone signals from the reflections at the duct terminations, and turbulent boudary layer related pseudo-sound. A quite good agreement was found between the predicted and measured acoustic data. The tools showed also a good potential for estimating installation effects. Finally, the paper demonstrates the benefits of applying different methods, characterized by different modelling assumptions, for a more thorough understanding of the sound generation mechanisms...|$|E

50|$|An {{electric}} motor uses electrical energy to produce mechanical energy, usually through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors. The reverse process, producing electrical energy from mechanical energy, is accomplished by a generator or dynamo. Traction motors used on vehicles often perform both tasks. Electric motors can be run as generators and vice versa, although {{this is not always}} practical.Electric motors are ubiquitous, being found in applications as diverse as <b>industrial</b> fans, <b>blowers</b> and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives. They may be powered by direct current (for example a battery powered portable device or motor vehicle), or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid. The smallest motors may be found in electric wristwatches. Medium-size motors of highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial uses.

In the present work, the effect of clearance gap {{on the performance of}} an <b>industrial</b> sized centrifugal <b>blower</b> is simulated for two volutes of width ratios and various flow coefficients. The results show that the clearance has a positive effect at low mass flow rates. This is observed in the pressure rise (1. 3 %) as well as in efficiency (0. 7 %). At higher mass flow rates, it has a negative effect with a drop in efficiency of 1 % and pressure drop of about 1. 4 %.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. This paper compares and evaluates the {{performance}} of two major feature selection and fault identification methods utilized for the Condition Monitoring (CM) of centrifugal equipment, namely FFT-based Segmentation, Feature Selection, and Fault Identification (FS 2 FI) algorithm and Neural Network (NN). Mutli-Layer Perceptron is {{the most commonly used}} NN model for fault pattern recognition. Feature-selection and Trending {{play an important role in}} pattern recognition, and hence, affect {{the performance of}} CM systems. The technical and developmental challenges of both methods were investigated experimentally on a Paxton <b>industrial</b> centrifugal air <b>blower</b> system with a rotational speed of 15, 650 RPMâ€Ÿs. Five different machine conditions were experimentally emulated in the laboratory. A low training-to-testing ratio of 50 % was utilized to evaluate the performance of both methods. In order to maximize fault identification accuracy and minimize computing time and cost, a near-optimal NN configuration was identified. The results showed that both techniques operated with a fault identification accuracy of 100 %. However, the FS 2 FI algorithm showed a number of advantages over NN. These advantages include the ease of implementation and a reduction of cost and time in development and computing, as it processed the data from the first trial in less than 6. 2 % of the time taken by the neural network...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 The North-West University is {{currently}} conducting {{research in the}} area of active magnetic bearings (AMBs). The aim of this research is to establish a foundation for the development of AMB systems to be used in industrial applications. These systems should be reliable, effective and economical. The main research objective for this project is to further develop key technologies in order to realize an economical, reliable high-speed AMB drive system to be used in high-speed machinery. The proposed system is the AMB and drive electronic system (ADES), which is a digital control system for controlling AMBs in an industrial environment. The development of the ADES was a group effort. The focus of this dissertation was on selecting and implementing a suitable controller to be used in the ADES. The specification for the ADES was obtained from an <b>industrial</b> high-speed helium <b>blower</b> system. Selecting the controller was done by concurrently evaluating the conceptual main controller architectures and proposed system architectures. The system architecture is based on an industrial form factor, called compact peripheral component interconnect (PCI), or cPCI, which is an industrial version of PCI. The architectures were evaluated by performing trade-off studies and by weighing each architecture against a decision matrix, which weighs the architectures according to robustness, efficiency, cost, risk, reliability, flexibility and expandability. The selected system architecture includes a single board computer (SBC) with two PCI mezzanine cards (PMCs); a VirtexÂ®- 5 field programmable gate array (FPGA) based PMC module, for scheduling real-time tasks, and a Profibus PMC module, which will be used in future iterations of this project to interface the ADES with a programmable logic controller (PLC). The specified functions were designed, verified and implemented on the selected controller. The digital control was implemented on the FPGA-embedded PowerPC whereas the communication and filters were implemented on the FPGA. The sensitivity analysis placed the system into zone C, which implies a system normally considered unsatisfactory for long-term continuous operation. The system may operate in this condition for a limited period, until a suitable opportunity arises for remedial action. It was also determined that the system is stable for a step-input added to the reference position. Due to the stability of the control, it was possible to suspend the rotor at its designed rating of 19, 000 r/min, but due to the high sensitivity rating, prolonged operation at this speed is not recommended. The selected architecture is versatile and powerful. The FPGA as a co-processor can be used to alleviate the load on the PowerPC, if additional features are required and not enough clock cycles are left on the PowerPC to implement them. The solution is compact, powerful and robust. These features, together with the industrial-based architecture of the system, make the ADES a suitable controller for controlling AMBs in an industrial system. Master...|$|R
