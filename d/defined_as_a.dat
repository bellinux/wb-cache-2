5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E
5|$|A double-double is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{performance}} {{in which a}} player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E

The gamma function is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from zero to infinity. This contrasts with the lower incomplete gamma function, which is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from zero to a variable upper limit. Similarly, the upper incomplete gamma function is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from a variable lower limit to infinity.|$|R

5|$|Abelisauridae is {{a family}} in rank-based Linnaean taxonomy, within the infraorder Ceratosauria and the {{superfamily}} Abelisauroidea, which also contains the family Noasauridae. It has had several definitions in phylogenetic taxonomy. It was originally <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> node-based taxon including Abelisaurus, Carnotaurus, their common ancestor {{and all of its}} descendants.|$|E

5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (<b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} {{the boiling}} frog {{story has been}} used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox.

50|$|An {{accident}} may be <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> event {{leading to}} injury, occupational illness, death, or material loss or damage.

Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.|$|E

The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically {{states that the}} fair catch kick is not a free kick, instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick. Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E

A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This {{is the basis of}} the rhythmic mode.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|A quintuple-double is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{performance}} {{in which a}} player accumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—-in a single game. There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both only done at the high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. The second was by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E

5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commutative division ring.|$|E
5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
