50|$|In 1958, Western Union {{started to}} build a telex network in the United States. This telex network started as a <b>satellite</b> <b>exchange</b> located in New York City and {{expanded}} to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens & Halske AG, now Siemens AG, and ITT to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. Teleprinter equipment was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Initial direct international telex service was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, {{in the summer of}} 1960 with limited service to London and Paris. In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5). The telex network expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, despite the Occupation, {{commercial}} activities began to flourish {{and demand for}} telecommunications services increased greatly. This necessitated a third floor to be built at the telephone exchange building in Kuala Lumpur. Along {{with the issue of}} 10 cent coins, phone booths began to spring up in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. From 1950 to 1953, the Department’s revenue more than doubled from $8 million to $17 million as the number of telephones installed rose from 20,000 to 39,000. Accordingly, the trunk and junction networks expanded, and the number of radio stations grew by 10 times to more than 1,000. In 1953, too, the Penang Auto Exchange was opened catering for 5,000 lines. In 1954, the Main Trunk Route linking Singapore to Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Penang was completed. <b>Satellite</b> <b>exchanges</b> began to emerge. During this period, international connections have also increased, linking Malaysia {{with the rest of the}} world.|$|R

40|$|In many countries, {{capital markets}} are often served by {{multiple}} stock exchanges, typically with one national or dominant exchange and several regional or <b>satellite</b> <b>exchanges.</b> While multiple exchanges create a competitive landscape, they {{also lead to}} fragmented liquidity and diseconomies in operations. This paper examines {{the role of the}} Lahore Stock Exchange (LSE) in comparison with the country’s dominant exchange, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), in four areas: (i) market efficiency in processing information, (ii) transaction costs, (iii) contribution to price discovery, and (iv) market integration. A comparative analysis of the exchange performance indicates the two exchanges to be at par in terms of informational efficiency and transaction costs. There is evidence of informational linkages and interdependencies between the two exchanges; the LSE appears to contribute to price discovery and competes to an appreciable extent. Against the background of proposals to merge the country’s three stock exchanges, a major consideration in evaluating public policy is the relative performance of the LSE and its viability as an effective competitor. Eliminating inter-exchange competition by merging the stock exchanges is predicted to lead to higher transaction costs, lower incentives for regulatory compliance, and diminished motivation for promoting capital market development...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our first {{objective}} was to develop an index of <b>satellite</b> <b>exchange</b> and then determine whether satellite exchangers (SEs) differed demographically or behaviorally from other injecting drug users (IDUs). Our second {{objective was}} to determine the degree that SEs contributed to needle exchange program (NEP) effectiveness. METHODS: We collected data from approximately 5000 Baltimore Needle Exchange Program (BNEP) participants on the number of syringes acquired and returned over the two-year period February 1995 to February 1997. We then conducted one-way ANOVAs and logistic regressions to determine if SEs were different from other IDUs. RESULTS: We classified 9. 35 % of the IDUs and SEs and showed that SEs reported levels of drug use and risk behavior similar to other BNEP participants. Although SEs represented less than 10 % of all BNEP clients, they accounted for more than 64 % of all needles distributed by the BNEP. We showed that SEs accessed more wide-ranging drug use networks than non-SE IDUs and thus can act as potential bridges for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention materials and messages to larger numbers of drug injectors. CONCLUSIONS: SEs can be expressly targeted with specific prevention messages and encouraged to be "ambassadors" for HIV prevention messages. Efforts to curtail the activities of SEs may detract from the effectiveness of NEPs...|$|R

Mainly due to continue earth surface monitoring capability, satellites are collecting a valuable set of data (images), which is increasingly developing together with the developments of the computer.

But, some other satellites also monitored the disaster and left valuable data to study the damage.

This method appears to analyze the physical nature of shepherding in sparse particle disks.
