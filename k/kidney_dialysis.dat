40|$|ObjectivePrevious {{studies on}} outcome of cardiac surgery and its {{predictors}} {{in patients with}} preoperative <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> have included small numbers of patients with limited follow-up. In addition, predictors of long-term outcome are not well characterized. MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 6694 patients, including 245 (3. 7 %) patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and September 2006. Potential predictors of hospital mortality, complications, and late survival were retrospectively analyzed by using multivariate regression models. ResultsPatients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> had a 3. 9 -times higher hospital mortality rate compared with other cardiac surgery patients (12. 7 % vs 3. 6 %, P <. 001). Patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> were younger but presented with more comorbidities and more severe cardiac disease than the control group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> {{was identified as a}} predictor of hospital mortality (odds ratio, 3. 1; P <. 001). Patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> also had an increased risk of postoperative sepsis (odds ratio, 2. 7; P <. 001) and respiratory failure (odds ratio, 2. 0; P <. 001). Peripheral vascular disease was an independent predictor of hospital mortality in patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> (odds ratio, 2. 5; P =. 001). Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> compared with that seen in the control group (1 -year and 5 -year survival: 72. 3 % ± 3. 3 % and 39. 0 % ± 4. 5 % vs 94. 2 % ± 0. 3 % and 83. 2 % ± 0. 6 %, P <. 001). Peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio, 2. 69; P =. 008) and previous stroke (odds ratio, 4. 37; P <. 001) were independent risk factors of late mortality in the subgroup of patients with end-stage <b>kidney</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis.</b> ConclusionsPreoperative renal failure requiring dialysis is associated with a significant increase in hospital mortality, postoperative sepsis, and respiratory failure in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In these patients long-term survival is particularly reduced in the presence of advanced atherosclerotic disease...|$|R
