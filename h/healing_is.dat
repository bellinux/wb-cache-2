5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. <b>Healing</b> <b>is</b> delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> noted.|$|E

5000|$|In Christian theology, the Gifts of <b>healing</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} spiritual gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12. As an {{extraordinary}} charism, gifts of <b>healing</b> <b>are</b> supernatural enablements {{given to a}} believer to minister various kinds of healing and restoration to individuals {{through the power of}} the Holy Spirit. In the Greek of the New Testament, both the words gift and <b>healing</b> <b>are</b> plural.|$|R
50|$|The first {{lessons of}} the art of <b>healing</b> <b>were</b> learnt from Dindayal Upadhyaya of Gaya, who was an Ayurvedic practitioner. Further {{knowledge}} and techniques of <b>healing</b> <b>were</b> learnt from the Lamas and the Buddhist Tantrics of Tibet.|$|R
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
25|$|The body {{responds}} to postoperative wounds {{in the same}} manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and wound <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative wound <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E
25|$|Wound <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> {{a natural}} {{regeneration}} process of dermal and epidermal tissue involving {{a sequence of}} biochemical events. These events are complex and can be categorized into three stages: inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. The study on vocal fold wound <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> not as extensive as that on animal models due to the limited availability of human vocal folds. Vocal fold injuries can {{have a number of}} causes including chronic overuse, chemical, thermal and mechanical trauma such as smoking, laryngeal cancer, and surgery. Other benign pathological phenomena like polyps, vocal fold nodules and edema will also introduce disordered phonation.|$|E
30|$|<b>Healing</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} radiologically and clinically: radiologically, callus {{bridging the}} fracture {{site and the}} appearance of three cortices bridging the distraction corticotomy on antero-posterior and lateral radiographs indicated healing. Clinical fracture <b>healing</b> <b>was</b> determined when the patient was able to bear weight freely without supporting aids after frame dynamization.|$|R

30|$|Among {{cases of}} OR/IF in our study, case numbers 1 and 3 {{experienced}} plate fracture occurring 1 and 2  months after fixation surgery, respectively. Increased {{load on the}} plate due to low remaining bone volume and slow bone <b>healing</b> <b>was</b> likely the cause of fracture; however, bone <b>healing</b> <b>was</b> observed after proper inflammation control and immobilization.|$|R
25|$|The {{abdominal}} {{technique is}} very often applied in difficult circumstances or when complications are expected.

25|$|After {{the laser}} has {{reshaped}} the stromal layer, the LASIK flap is carefully repositioned over the treatment area by the surgeon and checked {{for the presence}} of air bubbles, debris, and proper fit on the eye.

50|$|Accelerated bone {{fracture}} <b>healing</b> <b>was</b> found when researchers implanted Sp7-expressing bone marrow stroma cells {{at a site}} of {{bone fracture}}. It {{was found that the}} mechanism by which Sp7-expression accelerated bone <b>healing</b> <b>was</b> by new bone formation as well as induction of neighboring cells to express bone-specific genes. Similar results have been seen with osseo-integrating implants.|$|R

30|$|Twenty {{patients}} were prospectively randomized. Sensory loss and skin <b>healing</b> <b>were</b> assessed at 6, 12 and 52  weeks.

25|$|Divine Science, Unity Church, and Religious Science are {{organizations}} that {{developed from the}} New Thought movement. Each teaches that Infinite Intelligence, or God, is the sole reality. New Thought adherents believe that sickness {{is the result of}} the failure to realize this truth. In this line of thinking, <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> accomplished by the affirmation of oneness with the Infinite Intelligence or God.|$|E
25|$|In a dry socket, <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> delayed because tissue must {{grow from}} the {{surrounding}} gingival mucosa, which takes longer than the normal organisation of a blood clot. Some patients may develop short term halitosis, {{which is the result}} of food debris stagnating in the socket and the subsequent action of halitogenic bacteria. The main factors involved in the development of dry socket are discussed below.|$|E

25|$|Healing time is {{prolonged}} for higher stage ulcers. While about 75% of Stage II ulcers heal within eight weeks, only 62% of Stage IV pressure ulcers ever heal, and only 52% heal within one year. Pressure ulcers do not regress in stage as they heal. A pressure ulcer that is becoming shallower with <b>healing</b> <b>is</b> {{described in terms}} of its original deepest depth (e.g., healing Stage II pressure ulcer).|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} the series drew {{inspiration}} from several natural locations in the United Kingdom.
