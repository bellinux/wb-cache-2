2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (<b>deflector)</b> <b>piston.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{piston crown}} was usually shaped with a raised rib as a <b>deflector</b> <b>piston,</b> {{so that the}} fresh charge was {{intended}} to move upwards into a vertical loop, then downwards with the exhaust gas.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the gasflow {{failed to}} follow the {{idealised}} pattern. The rib of the <b>deflector</b> <b>piston</b> also gave a poor shape for the combustion chamber, with long flame paths and excessive surface area. This method of scavenging has now been almost entirely replaced by loop scavenging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deflector</b> <b>pistons</b> {{are used}} in {{two-stroke}} engines with crankcase compression, where the gas flow within the cylinder must be carefully directed {{in order to provide}} efficient scavenging. With cross scavenging, the transfer (inlet to the cylinder) and exhaust ports are on directly facing sides of the cylinder wall. To prevent the incoming mixture passing straight across from one port to the other, the piston has a raised rib on its crown. This is intended to deflect the incoming mixture upwards, around the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|This {{not only}} {{prevents}} the fuel/air mixture from traveling directly out the exhaust port, but also creates a swirling turbulence which improves combustion efficiency, power and economy. Usually, a <b>piston</b> <b>deflector</b> is not required, so {{this approach has}} a distinct advantage over the cross-flow scheme (above).|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and <b>deflector</b> type <b>piston.</b> The inlet non-return valve {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, the <b>deflector</b> <b>piston</b> form of cross {{scavenging}} was termed [...] "loop scavenging", after the supposed {{shape of the}} flow. Schnuerle flow was termed [...] "reverse loop scavenging". As {{the first of these}} was realised to be inaccurate, the later form adopted the simpler name. These original terms are now obsolete and no longer used.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s DKW {{pioneered the}} Schnürle {{two-stroke}} loop scavenging process {{to dispense with}} the use of a <b>deflector</b> <b>piston</b> and improve efficiency of the combustion chamber. DKW also developed a highly efficient arrangement of transfer ports. These two features were included in the RT 125 to great commercial advantage. Competitor companies such as Adler and TWN copied the adoption of flat-topped pistons and strove to develop equally transfer port arrangements without infringing DKW's patent.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, the German {{engineer}} Adolf Schnürle {{developed the}} system of ports that bears his name. The ports were relocated to both {{be on the same}} side of the cylinder, with the transfer port being split into two angled ports, one on either side of the exhaust port. A <b>deflector</b> <b>piston</b> was no longer required. The gas flow was now a circular loop, flowing in and across the piston crown from the transfer ports, up and around the combustion chamber and then out through the exhaust port.|$|E
50|$|The pistons {{are short}} {{cylindrical}} parts which seal {{one end of}} the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation. The top wall of the piston is termed its crown and is typically flat or concave. Some two-stroke engines use <b>pistons</b> with a <b>deflector</b> head. <b>Pistons</b> are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure (the piston web). When an engine is working the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a gudgeon pin. Each piston has rings fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber. A ventilation system drives the small amount of gas that escape past the pistons during normal operation (the blow-by gases) out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion. In two-stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air-fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system.|$|R
5000|$|The Commer TS3 3-cylinder truck engines (originally {{designed}} by Tilling-Stevens) {{have a single}} crankshaft beneath {{the centre of the}} cylinders with both pistons connected by levers. This type of engine configuration dates at least back as far as 1914, as a 2-stroke petrol engine referred to as the [...] "Simpson's balanced two-stroke" [...] was described in the Motor Cycle magazine of this date. This design used crankcase compression, and used one piston to uncover the transfer port, and another to open the exhaust port allowing the fresh charge to flow {{from one end of the}} cylinder to the other, thereby avoiding the need for <b>deflector</b> crowns for <b>pistons</b> used in most 2-strokes at that time. The levers operating the pistons allowed for a large piston travel with smaller crank throw.|$|R
