His mother was deeply concerned that he might be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; <b>his</b> <b>captors,</b> encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E

Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E
