25|$|The Buckeyes got {{the ball}} <b>going</b> <b>again,</b> but their next {{possession}} ended on the Wolverine 36. Michigan drove down the field again and Schembechler went for it on a fourth-and-three on the Ohio State 3. Morehead tossed to Mandich for a touchdown, but it was called back on an illegal procedure penalty. Ted Killian kicked the field goal to put Michigan up at the half 24–12.

25|$|The {{engineers}} {{tried in}} vain get the boiler <b>going</b> <b>again</b> to raise steam, but at around eleven forty the {{watch on the}} bridge saw land {{only a few hundred}} yards away directly to leeward.

At about eleven forty-five the ship struck the reef twice, with the second strike causing the starboard side to be ripped wide open and within two minutes the Bokhara had sunk.|$|E

25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} <b>going</b> <b>again</b> {{to check}} the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
25|$|Several episodes {{received}} {{extremely high}} audience figures, especially the first series. This was {{partly due to}} the fact that the main rival channel to BBC One channel in the UK, ITV, was in the middle of a long protracted strike which started in early August 1979, which saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air and no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Island), leaving only BBC One and BBC Two as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24th October 1979 when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a pay agreement. However many viewers remained with the BBC and shows such as To The Manor Born, as ITV took some months to get <b>going</b> <b>again</b> with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave To The Manor Born a huge advantage with the viewing public. In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest viewing figure for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981, when Audrey and Richard marry, received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I do need a change, just to get myself <b>going</b> <b>again</b> really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high on my list. There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E

500|$|Devourment {{reformed}} during Rosas's incarceration, with Knupp taking Rosas's {{place on}} vocals, and Braxton Henry rejoining the {{band in the}} place of Brian Wynn. The band recorded a single song, named [...] "Babykiller", which was featured on a compilation album named Southern Uprising. The song was also featured on the band's own compilation album, 1.3.8., the title of which represents the one song, [...] "Babykiller", with the three songs from Impaled, and the eight songs from Molesting the Decapitated. The compilation was released four times—once on Corpse Gristle Records while Rosas was in jail, once on Unmatched Brutality in 2004, once after Rosas's release while the band was working on new material, including the band's first DVD, on Displeased Records, and finally as a limited edition record by the label Night of the Vinyl Dead. Upon Rosas's release in 2002, he reformed the band with new members, featuring himself on vocals, guitarists Robert Moore and Kevin Clark, Jeremy Peterson on drums and Joseph Fontenot (later of Jacknife) on bass. Clark was then replaced by Chris Hutto of Ingurgitate. Rosas's new lineup played a few shows, but then split up again. Majewski later referred to the time between the band's two full-length albums, explaining that [...] "Ruben and I both made attempts to get the band <b>going</b> <b>again</b> but both failed".|$|E
500|$|Two riders very {{disappointed}} with their results were Michael Matthews and Fabian Cancellara. Matthews crashed {{at high speed}} shortly before the Cipressa and arrived at the finish with a bandaged right elbow. He said: [...] "Obviously I'm devastated. [...] This was everything, this was my world championships {{for the start of}} the season. [...] I was really looking forward to making a good finale, it's really unfortunate that a crash stopped me from doing that." [...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him. I stayed up but I lost a lot speed and never managed to get <b>going</b> <b>again</b> in the final metres." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a rematch}} of the {{previous}} season's C-USA championship game, the Pirates (6–4, 5–1) dominated on offense {{in the first half}} and then sealed the game with three defensive touchdowns in the fourth quarter during a rare Sunday night game at Chapman Stadium on November 15. [...] Damaris Johnson, the nation's leader in all-purpose yardage, got the Golden Hurricane back in the game after the Pirates had built a 20-point lead in the first half. He returned a kickoff 57 yards and then had catches on back-to-back plays, the second going for 9 yards and a touchdown that brought Tulsa to 23–17 with 4 minutes left in the third quarter. East Carolina couldn't get its offense <b>going</b> <b>again</b> after amassing 401 yards in the first half, but G.J. Kinne's pass to Johnson was intercepted and returned for a touchdown to provide some extra cushion. Tulsa got the ball to the 7 on its ensuing possession, but Kinne's pass on fourth-and-6 bounced off of nose guard Linval Joseph's helmet and fell incomplete. An ECU defender then picked off another Kinne pass and brought it back 57 yards to put the game away with 2:23 remaining. The Pirates added a 49-yard return of a Kinne fumble 46 seconds later. [...] Kinne finished with 236 yards on 23-for-46 passing with two touchdowns and the two interceptions. Johnson had 14 catches for 135 yards. Ryan Fitzpatrick also connected on a career-long 51-yard field goal.|$|E
2500|$|Match referee Chris Broad {{was also}} {{critical}} of the security provided. He stated {{that he and his}} colleagues were left like 'sitting ducks' in the trailing minivan during the attack. He also accused the security personnel of fleeing the scene. He questioned why the Pakistan team which usually travelled with the Sri Lankan team was delayed by seven minutes that day and avoided being attacked. Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying. Umpire Simon Taufel also said that the umpire's minibus was abandoned while the players' bus was moved to the ground to evacuate the players. [...] Slamming the security entourage for abandoning them and inability of the police to arrest the attackers Simon said,"You tell me why no one was caught. You tell me why. Supposedly 25 armed commandos were in our convoy, and when the team bus got <b>going</b> <b>again,</b> we were left on our own." [...] Co-umpire Steve Davis said [...] "he felt let down" [...] by the security. International Cricket Council umpires performance manager for East Asia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Peter Manuel told Dawn [...] that the minivan carrying the umpires was basically abandoned by the security personnel. 'It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials,' the outraged Manuel said. Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security. [...] English cricketer Dominic Cork who was commentating in Pakistan on the series and who himself was caught in the attack later criticised the security and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt.|$|E

2500|$|... 1988, {{the last}} ever Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh {{race of the}} season from McLaren {{teammate}} and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 {{was hit by a}} deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, {{who did not want to}} start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got <b>going</b> <b>again</b> and finished 1st on the road but after a lot of political ramifications, he was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was in an awful mental state, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini's slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. But even with such a huge lead which extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known to take chances that most other drivers would not. But going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna came up behind Briton Martin Brundle's Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not let up and then he hit the back of Brundle's car and it tore off his front left wheel and suspension, so the Brazilian had to retire; effectively handing Prost his third Drivers' Championship; McLaren's appeal had not been decided yet; and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, the race was called after it reached the two-hour time limit.|$|E
