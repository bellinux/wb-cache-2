5|$|The Varaha Upanishad, in Chapter 4, {{states that}} {{individuals}} gain knowledge through seven stages: First, one must have virtuous desire to learn, discover (Subh-echchha). The second stage is inquiry, investigation (Vichārana). Discernment and thinning of mind toward other objects (Tanumanasi) {{is the third}} stage, states the text. The fourth stage is harmony, creative union with the subject of knowledge (Sattva-patti). Detachment <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> else (Asamsakti) is the fifth stage. Conceptual analysis and gaining complete, correct meaning of the topic (Pad-artha-bhavana) is the sixth stage. The seventh or last stage is Turiya, complete consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage of}} a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

500|$|EMI-Columbia {{released}} Pink Floyd's second single, [...] "See Emily Play", on 16 June 1967. It fared {{slightly better}} than [...] "Arnold Layne", peaking at number6 in the UK. The band performed on the BBC's Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and it was around this time that the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and Mason described him as [...] "completely distanced <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> going on".|$|E

[...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E

500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways."

500|$|In late 2003 Farrell starred as a {{criminal}} who plots a bank robbery with Cillian Murphy in the dark comedy Intermission, which held the record for highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box-office history {{for three years and}} remains a cult classic there. In 2004, he appeared in several other independent films receiving limited theatrical release in most countries, including A Home at the End of the World (adapted from Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World). Roger Ebert praised Farrell, saying that he was [...] "astonishing in the movie, not least because the character is such a departure <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> he has done before". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle differed, saying that the actor [...] "is keen on making good....The effort is there, but it's a performance you end up rooting for rather than enjoying, because there's no way to just relax and watch".|$|E

It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her.

500|$|Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, {{during a}} period when the Romanian Kingdom kept out of World War I. In autumn 1915, as founder {{and editor of the}} {{short-lived}} journal Chemarea, Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature Tristan Tzara. At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an anti-war and anti-nationalist current, which progressively accommodated anti-establishment messages. Chemarea, which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea. According to Romanian avant-garde writer Claude Sernet, the journal was [...] "totally different <b>from</b> <b>everything</b> that had been printed in Romania before that moment." [...] During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's Versuri și Proză, and, in June 1915, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru's Noua Revistă Română published Samyro's known poem Verișoară, fată de pension ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").|$|E

In its 2004 solo release, few critics reviewed Everything in Time because it was not a studio album. However, Laura Sinagra for Blender magazine gave it three stars out of five, saying it contained [...] "endearing, younger examples of the marriage-minded tomboy [...] agonizing over the task of taming restless playboys". She complimented [...] "New Friend", [...] "Under Construction" [...] and both versions of [...] "Everything in Time" [...] as [...] "satisfying laments" [...] with [...] "truth-serum lyrics", and praised Stefani's [...] "just-a-girl sass" [...] in [...] "Oi to the World". However, she criticized [...] "Big Distraction" [...] and [...] "Leftovers", which in her opinion were [...] "pale beside the singles [...] ".
