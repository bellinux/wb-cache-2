5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to a {{colleague}} of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the analysis would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had {{an affair with}} Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him {{of a time when}} he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E

5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
25|$|Hillary Clinton managed {{an upset}} win over Barack Obama in New Hampshire, despite polls showing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 13 points {{behind in the}} run-up to the vote. The win helped Clinton get back some of the {{momentum}} she lost the week before when Obama carried the Iowa caucuses—though Obama did eventually win the Democratic nomination. John McCain won the Republican primary, sparking an unexpected comeback for the senator whose long-shot campaign had been written off as a lost cause months before. He went on to win the GOP nomination.|$|E
25|$|La Fayette, one of {{the former}} {{military}} leaders in the American War of Independence (1775–83), served as the warden {{of the royal family}} in his position as commander-in-chief of the Garde nationale. Despite his dislike of the queen—he detested <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> she detested him and at one time had even threatened to send her to a convent—he was persuaded by the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, to work collaborate with her, and allowed her to see Fersen a number of times. He even went as far as exiling the Duke of Orléans, who was accused by the queen of fomenting trouble. His relationship with the king was more cordial. As a liberal aristocrat he did not want the fall of the monarchy but rather the establishment of a liberal one, {{similar to that of the}} United Kingdom, based on cooperation between the king and the people, as was to be defined in the Constitution of 1791.|$|E

Despite Imogen wanting to keep the relationship a secret, Paul told her mother Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Daniel was invited to lunch with the Willis family and he tried his best to impress Terese, but soon realised that it was Imogen's father, Brad (Kip Gamblin), that he needed approval from. Daniel's efforts to impress Brad went wrong when he caused [...] "an unsettling incident" [...] that suddenly ended the lunch.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anything else in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was {{transferred}} from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n° 280'. Leaving the tower she bumped {{her head against the}} lintel of a door, which prompted one of her guards to ask her if she was hurt, to which she answered, [...] "No! Nothing now can hurt me." [...] This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy. The [...] "Carnation Plot" [...] (Le complot de l'œillet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards. She was attended by Rosalie Lamorlière, who took care of <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{significant}} problems {{given to the}} romance are the couple's trust issues. One issue revolves around JR not knowing if he can trust Babe {{to be faithful to}} him. After cheating on JR with his brother Jamie due to what Babe states was a result of being nervous about meeting JR's family for the first time, JR later develops the tendency to occasionally refer to Babe as [...] "a slut" [...] or issue one-liners about her inability to be faithful to a romantic partner. Months after JR's murder attempt on Babe, the writers sought to prominently resurrect the unfaithfulness theme. Babe voices that JR does not communicate with <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he used to. Consistently feeling this way, Babe is seen being drawn to relative new character and [...] "white knight" [...] Josh Madden, whom she eventually cheats on JR with, emotionally and later sexually. [...] "JR doesn't let Babe in," [...] relayed Havins of her character's emotional affair with Josh.|$|E
2500|$|Nick and Sharon {{remained}} {{apart for}} a number of months. However, they worked together in court to legally adopt Cassie as their own. Nick moved back into the family home, Case explained [...] "Neither knew what the other wanted. So, Sharon went to bed and Nick slept on the couch." [...] During this time, they reconnected and eventually got back together, as Nick grew even closer to Cassie as his own daughter. The show's then head-writer at the time Kay Alden, said [...] "This {{has been a long time}} coming for Sharon and Nick [...] For the last several months, there's been a lot of stop-and-go — and mixed messages — between them. But now the feelings they have for each other are definitely clear." [...] Sharon and Nick were awarded custody of Cassie, and Nick adopted Cassie and became her father. Joshua Morrow stated: [...] "Nick has accepted Cassie as his daughter. He loves <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he loves Noah. She's an incredible child and Nick is crazy about her". Of their reunion, Case said: [...] "Happiness doesn't just mean lying around in bed saying, 'I love you' everyday for the rest of their lives. Love expresses itself in other ways. One way is getting over the hurdles of life together. So, I'm sure they will be more hurdles to come." ...|$|E

People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E
