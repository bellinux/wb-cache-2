30|$|It is hard {{to assess}} the {{complexity}} of the algorithms in an analytical manner. Therefore, we compared their relative complexity per sample based on the duration of an actual implementation on a Matlab simulation <b>platform.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 displays the results. Apparently, the phase-based sampling method with the prior importance sampling distribution bears the lowest complexity. Based on the simplicity of this estimator operation (see Section 5.2. 2), this result does not come as a surprise.|$|R

40|$|A product {{platform}} is {{the set of}} subsystems shared across products offered by a firm. The problem of designing a product family based on a {{platform is}} formulated as an optimization exercise, from which a practical implementation is derived. The implementation consists of teams developing candidate concepts, a platform team then using these to form a platform, and finally the teams redesigning, making use of the platform. The result {{is a set of}} candidate product families: both the shared platform and the individual portions of each variant. These candidate designs may all be feasible, but they will likely have different attributes in several dimensions, such as technical performance, risk, costs, etc. The designers must then trade off design choices for the platform and the variants to determine an adequate overall family result. The procedure is illustrated by the conceptual design of JPL spacecraft making use of different telecommunications <b>platforms.</b> <b>TABLE</b> OF CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTI [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Chile’s higher {{education}} {{system can be}} shown, {{with the help of}} descriptive statistics, to have a highly diversified institutional <b>platform</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). It is made up of 209 institutions; 61 universities, 43 professional institutes and 105 technical training centers. Universities offer principally types 5 A and 6 programs (according to the International Standard Classification of Education or ISCED, 1997) 3 but can offer 5 B programs. Professional institutes offer 5 A programs that are not exclusively reserved for universities 4 and 5 B programs, while technical training centers can only offer 5 B programs (Fernández, Gutiérrez & Martínez, 2005). In turn, institutions are classified as public (state) institutions and independent and dependent private institutions (see OECD, 2007). A great majority (88 per cent of the total) are independent private institutions; of these, almost all universities have full autonomy- that is, they have completed the required legal process prior to their licensing, as do most professional institutes. In contrast, only 15 per cent of the technical training centers have achieved full autonomy 5. All professional institutes and technical training centers are private independent institutions...|$|R
5000|$|When {{initially}} {{questioned about}} the circumstances of Clodius' death, Milo responded with the excuse of self-defense {{and that it was}} Clodius who laid a trap for Milo to kill him. Cicero had to fashion his speech to be congruent with Milo's initial excuse, a restraint that probably affected the overall presentation of his case. To convince the jury of Milo's innocence, Cicero used the fact that following Clodius death, a mob of Clodius' own supporters, led by the scribe Sextus Cloelius, carried his corpse into the Senate house (curia) and cremated it using the benches, <b>platforms,</b> <b>tables</b> and scribes' notebooks, as a pyre. In doing so, it also burnt down much of the curia; [...] Clodius' supporters also launched an attack on the house of the then interrex, Marcus Lepidus. Pompey thus ordered a special inquest to investigate that as well as the murder of Clodius. Cicero refers to this incident throughout the Pro Milone by implying that there was greater general indignation and uproar at the burning of the curia than there was at the murder of Clodius.|$|R

2500|$|The Torah scroll {{is stored}} in an {{ornamental}} cabinet, called a holy ark (...) , designed specifically for Torah scrolls. The Holy Ark is usually found {{in the front of}} the sanctuary, and is a central element of synagogue architecture. When needed for reading, the Torah is removed from the ark by someone chosen for the honor from among the congregants; specific prayers are recited as it is removed. The Torah is then carried by the one leading the services to the bimah — a <b>platform</b> or <b>table</b> from which it will be read; further prayers are recited by the congregation while this is done.|$|R

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, a {{lookup table}} is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation. The savings {{in terms of}} processing time can be significant, since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing an [...] "expensive" [...] computation or input/output operation. The tables may be precalculated and stored in static program storage, calculated (or [...] "pre-fetched") {{as part of a}} program's initialization phase (memoization), or even stored in hardware in application-specific <b>platforms.</b> Lookup <b>tables</b> are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or invalid) items in an array and, in some programming languages, may include pointer functions (or offsets to labels) to process the matching input. FPGAs also make extensive use of reconfigurable, hardware-implemented, lookup tables to provide programmable hardware functionality.|$|R

40|$|Network {{management}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly complex task, requiring automated tools to support human effort. This document is intended to provide valuable information for network managers or operators {{on the use of}} ntop. ntop is a simple, free, portable traffic measurement and monitoring tool, which supports various management activities, including network optimization and planning, and detection of network security violations. In this paper, ntop’s features are briefly described, as well as installation procedures and examples of utilization. Alternative approaches to monitoring are also discussed. ntop has shown to be a valuable tool for quick access to network monitoring, with a simple to use integrated web interface and minimal requirements. It is available for network administrator with minimal (installing, learning) effort and cost, as opposed to expensive and complex (yet sophisticated and flexible) management <b>platforms.</b> i <b>Table</b> of content...|$|R

50|$|An {{equatorial}} <b>platform</b> or equatorial <b>table</b> is an {{equatorial telescope}} mount {{in the form}} of a specially designed platform that allows any device sitting on it to track astronomical objects in the sky on an equatorial axis. They are used to give equatorial tracking to any device sitting on them, from small cameras up to entire observatory buildings. They are often used with altazimuth mounted telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, to overcome that type of mount's inability to track the night sky.|$|R

Brother Gimblet, an elderly man with a crabbed face, a large dog's-eared shirt-collar, and a spotted blue neckerchief reaching up behind to the crown of his head, was also a drysalter and an expounder.
