5|$|The last {{important}} source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Ludgarda are Annals of Jan Długosz, {{who wrote about}} this events almost two centuries after (around 1480). Długosz was the first chronicler who locates Poznań as the place of Ludgarda's death.

Modern historiography generally supports the complete innocence of Przemysł II in {{the sudden death of}} his wife.|$|E

During the 20th century the painting became an icon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Stockholm and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated.|$|E

In 1925 he won first prize in piano accompaniment, and in 1926 he gained first prize in fugue. After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, {{he was awarded}} second prize <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing improvisation skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas.

5|$|Complementing his {{interest}} in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the Max Planck Institute <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> of Science in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of quantum field theory between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.|$|E
