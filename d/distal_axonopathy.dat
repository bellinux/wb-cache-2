40|$|Abstract. In April 1996, an {{outbreak}} of toxic polyneuropathy in cats occurred in the Netherlands. All cats had been fed one of two brands of dry cat food from one manufacturer. Chemical analyses of these foods, stomach contents, and liver and kidney of affected cats revealed contamination with the ionophor salinomycin. Epidemiologic and clinical {{data were collected from}} 823 cats, or about 1 % of the cats at risk. In 21 affected cats, postmortem examination was performed. The affected cats had acute onset of lameness and paralysis of the hindlimbs followed by the forelimbs. Clinical and pathologic examination indicated a distal polyneuropathy involving both the sensory and motor nerves. Key words: Cat; peripheral nervous system; polyneuropathy; salinomycin; toxic.

Mitofusins (Mfn 1 and Mfn 2) are required for mammalian mitochondrial fusion. In structure-function analysis, we have identified loss-of-function mutations in mitofusin GTPase and heptad-repeat domains that disrupt homotypic and heterotypic domain interactions. Mutations in Mfn 2 cause CMT 2 A, a progressive peripheral neuropathy. We have functionally characterized Mfn 2 disease mutations and find that wild-type Mfn 1, but not Mfn 2, can efficiently complement nonfunctional CMT 2 A alleles to restore mitochondrial fusion. This finding demonstrates the importance of Mfn 1 -Mfn 2 heterooligomers and suggests that Mfn 1 expression is important in determining the cell-type specificity of CMT 2 A. To study the consequences of an Mfn 2 CMT 2 A allele in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that express Mfn 2 T 105 M in motor neurons.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on equine laryngeal hemiplegia indicated that further investigations were warranted, in order to define more clearly the underlying pathogenic processes. This investigation was undertaken on one Standardbred and fourteen Thoroughbred horses, of which four were clinically affected with laryngeal hemiplegia, five subclinically affected and six were apparently normal. Their left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves were examined in detail, as were hindlimb nerves from two of the clinically affected animals. A variety of histological techniques were employed, including light and electron microscopy of resin embedded nerve, and single teased fibre preparations. Quantitative data obtained from these investigations was evaluated statistically. Some intrinsic laryngeal muscles, and the extenson digitonum longus muscle were investigated. In addition, the motor nucleus of the recurrent laryngeal nerve fibres, the nucleus ambiguus, and long central nerve fibre tracts were examined. The results demonstrated that the neuropathy of equine laryngeal hemiplegia is characteristic of a <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy.</b> Rather than being a disease of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, as it has previously been considered, a generalised neuropathological process affecting long and large diameter nerve fibres was found. The primary site of the lesion was shown to be the axon rather than the myelin sheath. Distal axonal atrophy was demonstrated. As well as the involvement of peripheral nerve fibres in the disease process, some evidence for the involvement of long fibres of the central nervous system was found. In addition, an investigation of the pathology associated with stringhalt, another nervous condition of horses, was performed on one animal. It was demonstrated that this was also a <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy,</b> although a number of differences from idiopathic laryngeal hemiplegia were observed. It was an acute rather than a chronic process, and lacked any involvement of central fibres. In conclusion, it was suggested that a number of previously postulated causes for equine laryngeal hemiplegia could be dismissed, {{on the basis of the}} finding of a generalised <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy.</b> This included those which suggested mechanical damage to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, such as stretch or compression. In light of the findings, the most likely aetiology underlying the pathology of equine laryngeal hemiplegia was considered to be an acquired or inherited metabolic defect affecting energy production in the axon, with the resultant inability to support the distal areas of long, large diameter nerve fibres...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} axonal {{transport}} in experimental neuropathy are reviewed {{and the following}} combinations of pathological changes and underlying axonal transport abnormalities are proposed for a classification of polyneuropathies. Alterations of the anterograde transport of slow component a(SCa) leads to changes of {{the dimensions of the}} axon calibre without the occurrence either of overt neuropathy or fibre loss. Thus damming of SCa in beta,beta'-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN) intoxication results in axonal swelling in nerve roots whereas decrease of SCa leads to atrophy distal to the swellings in IDPN intoxication and in streptozotocin induced diabetes as well. Decrease in the amount of material conveyed within the anterograde fast component (aFC) leads to acute axonal degeneration including break down of axons and fibre loss. This state occurs in acute hypoglycaemia and in doxorubicin intoxication. The most frequent type of polyneuropathy, namely <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy</b> with accumulation of axon organelles leading to distal fibre loss, is associated with decrease in amount of the retrograde fast component (rFC).

Organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a sensory-motor <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy</b> {{which usually}} occurs after ingestion of large doses of certain organophosphate insecticides and {{has so far}} only been reported in patients with preceding cholinergic toxicity. Surprisingly, it was recently reported by other authors that an exclusively sensory neuropathy developed in eight patients after repeated unquantified exposures to chlorpyrifos, which did not cause clear-cut cholinergic toxicity. The objective was to assess whether an exclusively sensory neuropathy develops in patients severely poisoned by various OPs.  METHODS—Toxicological studies and electrophysiological measurements were performed in peripheral motor and sensory nerves in 11 patients after acute organophosphate poisoning among which two subjects were poisoned with chlorpyrifos.  RESULTS—Three patients developed OPIDP, including one poisoned by chlorpyrifos. Exclusively sensory neuropathy was never seen after either single or repeated acute organophosphate poisoning. A mild sensory component {{was associated with a}} severe motor component in two of the three cases of OPIDP, the other was an exclusively motor polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSION—A sensory-motor polyneuropathy caused by organophosphate insecticides might occur after a severe poisoning and the sensory component, if present, is milder than the motor one. Bearing in mind the toxicological characteristics of these organophosphate insecticides, other causes should be sought for sensory peripheral neuropathies in patients who did not display severe cholinergic toxicity {{a few weeks before the}} onset of symptoms and signs. ...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal {{neurodegenerative disease}} of motor neurons (MNs) that causes skeletal muscle paralysis. Familial forms of ALS {{are linked to}} mutations in the superoxide dismutase- 1 (SOD 1) gene. The mechanisms of human SOD 1 (hSOD 1) toxicity to MNs are unknown. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle is a primary site of pathogenesis in ALS that triggers MN degeneration. We created transgenic (tg) mice expressing wild-type-, G 37 R- and G 93 A-hSOD 1 gene variants only in skeletal muscle. These tg mice developed age-related neurologic and pathologic phenotypes consistent with ALS. Affected mice showed limb weakness and paresis with motor deficits. Skeletal muscles developed severe pathology involving oxidative damage, protein nitration, myofiber cell death and marked neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities. Spinal MNs developed <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy</b> and formed ubiquitinated inclusions and degenerated through an apoptotic-like pathway involving capsase- 3. Mice expressing wild-type and mutant forms of hSOD 1 developed MN pathology. These results demonstrate that human SOD 1 in skeletal muscle has a causal role in ALS and identify a new non-autonomous mechanism for MN degeneration explaining their selective vulnerability. The discovery of instigating molecular toxicities or disease progression determinants within skeletal muscle could be very valuable {{for the development of}} new effective therapies for the treatment and cure of ALS...|$|E
40|$|Distal {{symmetrical}} sensory neuropathy in diabetes {{involves the}} dying back of axons, and the pathology equates with axonal dystrophy generated {{under conditions of}} aberrant Ca 2 + signalling. Previous work has described abnormalities in Ca 2 + homoeostasis in sensory and dorsal horn neurons acutely isolated from diabetic rodents. We extended this work by testing the hypothesis that sensory neurons exposed to long-term Type 1 diabetes in vivo would exhibit abnormal axonal Ca 2 + homoeostasis {{and focused on the}} role of SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase). DRG (dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons from age-matched normal and 3 – 5 -month-old STZ (streptozotocin) -diabetic rats (an experimental model of Type 1 diabetes) were cultured. At 1 – 2 days in vitro an array of parameters were measured to investigate Ca 2 + homoeostasis including (i) axonal levels of intracellular Ca 2 +, (ii) Ca 2 + uptake by the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), (iii) assessment of Ca 2 + signalling following a long-term thapsigargin-induced blockade of SERCA and (iv) determination of expression of ER mass and stress markers using immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. KCl- and caffeine-induced Ca 2 + transients in axons were 2 -fold lower in cultures of diabetic neurons compared with normal neurons indicative of reduced ER calcium loading. The rate of uptake of Ca 2 + into the ER was reduced by 2 -fold (P stasis possibly triggered by sub-optimal SERCA activity that could contribute to the <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy</b> observed in diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a {{peripheral}} neuropathy involving {{a loss of}} proprioceptive sensory neurons. Studies of biopsies from patients suggest that axonal dysfunction precedes the death of proprioceptive neurons in a dying-back process. We observed that the deficiency of frataxin in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of the YG 8 R mouse model causes the formation of axonal spheroids which retain dysfunctional mitochondria, shows alterations in the cytoskeleton and it produces impairment of axonal transport and autophagic flux. The homogenous distribution of axonal spheroids along the neurites supports the existence of continues focal damages. This lead us to propose for FRDA a model of <b>distal</b> <b>axonopathy</b> based on axonal focal damages. In addition, we observed the involvement of oxidative stress and dyshomeostasis of calcium in axonal spheroid formation generating axonal injury as a primary cause of pathophysiology. Axonal spheroids may be a consequence of calcium imbalance, thus we propose the quenching or removal extracellular Ca 2 + to prevent spheroids formation. In our neuronal model, treatments with BAPTA and o-phenanthroline reverted the axonal dystrophy and the mitochondrial dysmorphic parameters. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} axonal pathology is reversible in FRDA by pharmacological manipulation of intracellular Ca 2 + with Ca 2 + chelators or metalloprotease inhibitors, preventing Ca 2 +-mediated axonal injury. Thus, the modulation of Ca 2 + levels may be a relevant therapeutic target to develop early axonal protection and prevent dying-back neurodegeneration...|$|E
