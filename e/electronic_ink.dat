40|$|Just as HP {{is leading}} the {{transition}} to individually tailored content consumption for printed media with variable data printing from its digital presses, it is also actively pursuing full-color reflective display technologies as an electronic media in support of low-power applications for digital content consumption. A great challenge in realizing the potential of reflective electronic media is achieving vivid full colors that match or exceed the color gamut described by printing standards such as the Specifications for Newsprint Advertising Production (SNAP). Based {{on the principles of}} color printing, a stacked device design using a novel electrokinetic architecture has been proposed that offers the potential for achieving or exceeding SNAP’s color gamut. Proprietary electrically addressable imaging fluids (<b>electronic</b> <b>inks)</b> have been developed to support such design. <b>Electronic</b> <b>inks</b> with CMY primary colors have been demonstrated to exceed the chroma values of SNAP in a single layer. Integrated into a stack of electro-optic layers employing HP’s electrokinetic architecture, these inks have enabled a reflective full-color electronic media demonstrator built on roll-to-roll manufacturing platform with a color gamut approaching that of the SNAP standard. In this paper we report the development of full color <b>electronic</b> <b>inks</b> and demonstration of stacked full color reflective segmented and pixilated active matrix devices...|$|R

30|$|Nanoscale {{particles}} {{provide a}} narrow size distribution, which {{is required to}} obtain a uniform material response. Materials such as paints, pigments, <b>electronic</b> <b>inks</b> and ferrofluids, as well as advanced functional and structural ceramics, require that the particles be uniform in size and stable against agglomeration. Fine particles, particularly nanoscale particles with significant surface areas, often agglomerate to minimize the total surface or interfacial energy of the system. Although the process of using solution chemistry can be a practical route for the synthesis of both sub-micrometer and nanoscale particles of many materials, {{issues such as the}} control of size, distribution of particles, morphology, crystallinity, particle agglomeration during and after synthesis and separation of these particles from the reactant need further investigation.|$|R

EKD uses in-plane optical effects and out of plane switching fields to switch between color and clear states, allowing a stacked approach of color layers for a full-color display. The need for compaction into small volumes to achieve a clear state and repeated cycles of spreading and compaction creates challenges for the stabilization and charging of colorant particles.

Ligands not only passivate crystal facets and determine growth rates and shapes; they also affect size and colloidal stability. Particle shapes can be tuned via the ligand choice while ligand length, size, ω-functionalities, and chemical nature influence shelf-life and stability of nanoparticles in dispersions.

25|$|The {{network of}} {{electrodes}} connects to display circuitry, which turns the <b>electronic</b> <b>ink</b> 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge {{to the surface}} electrode repels the particles {{to the bottom of}} local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTransparent {{conductive}} {{films are}} made from aqueous surfactant stabilized dispersions of carbon nanotubesusing an up-scalable rod coating method. The processability of the films is governed {{by the amount of}} surfactant which is shown to alter strongly the wetting and viscosity of the ink. The increase of viscosity results from surfactant mediated attractive interactions between the carbon nanotubes. Links between the formulation, ink rheological properties, and electro-optical properties of the films are determined. The provided guidelines are generalized and used to fabricate optimized electrodes using conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes. In these electrodes, the carbon nanotubes act as highly efficient viscosifiers that allow the optimized ink to be homogeneously spread using the rod coating method. From a general point of view and in contrast to previous studies, the CNTs are optimally used in the present approach as conductive additives for viscosity enhancements of <b>electronic</b> <b>inks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the use of a}} {{recently}} developed lecture presentation system called Classroom Presenter to teach Mathematics. This system, that uses a Tablet PC as a presentation device, was developed at the University of Washington in response to the challenge of improving the ability of an instructor to interactively present lecture material from a computer. This system was tested with a group of Mathematics students doing a formal degree programme as well as with a group of students during an informal Mathematics upgrade programme. Some system-specific features will be shown that have contributed to a more spontaneous and interactive Mathematics classroom. These include high quality layered <b>electronic</b> <b>inking,</b> annotations on top of slides, time-efficient use of high quality Mathematics examples and the ease of movement between preprepared slides and whiteboards.

40|$|Suspensions {{of copper}} {{nanowires}} are emerging as new <b>electronic</b> <b>inks</b> for next-generation flexible electronics. Using a novel {{surface acoustic wave}} driven extensional flow technique {{we are able to}} perform currently lacking analysis of these suspensions and their complex buffer. We observe extensional viscosities from 3 mPa s (1 mPa s shear viscosity) to 37. 2 Pa s via changes in the suspension concentration, thus capturing low viscosities that have been historically very challenging to measure. These changes equate to an increase in the relative extensional viscosity of nearly 12 200 times at a volume fraction of just 0. 027. We also find that interactions between the wires and the necessary polymer additive affect the rheology strongly. Polymer-induced elasticity shows a reduction as the buffer relaxation time falls from 819 to 59 μs above a critical particle concentration. The results and technique presented here should aid in the future formulation of these promising nanowire suspensions and their efficient application as inks and coatings...|$|R

40|$|Planar 2 D {{materials}} are possibly the ideal channel candidates for future field effect transistors (FETs), {{due to their}} unique electronic properties. However, the performance of FETs based on 2 D materials is yet to exceed those of conventional silicon based devices. Here, a 2 D channel thin film made from liquid phase exfoliated molybdenum oxide nanoflake inks with highly controllable substoichiometric levels is presented. The ability to induce oxygen vacancies by solar light irradiation in an aqueous environment allows the tuning of electronic properties in 2 D substoichiometric molybdenum oxides (MoO 3 -x). The highest mobility {{is found to be}} approximate to 600 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) with an estimated free electron concentration of approximate to 1. 6 x 10 (21) cm(- 3) and an optimal I-On/I-Off ratio of > 10 (5) for the FETs made of 2 D flakes irradiated for 30 min (x = 0. 042).

40|$|International audienceThe {{preparation}} of inorganic-organic core-shell particles is presented. These particles, {{composed of a}} titanium dioxide core and a polymer shell, are prepared via precipitation polymerization and inverse microsuspension polymerization. The electrical and optical properties of dispersions of these particles in a paraffin oil are measured {{in view of the}} formulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>inks</b> for electrophoretic displays. Encapsulation of TiO 2 by precipitation polymerization is improved by pretreating the pigments with 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate, making it possible to prepare particles with a TiO 2 -to-polymer ratio varying over a wide range. This ratio has a considerable influence on the optical properties of the dispersion but also on the interactions between pigments and electrodes. The polymer shell can then be further functionalized by introducing acidic groups at the particle's surface. Encapsulation of the TiO 2 can also be achieved by inverse microsuspension polymerization of poly(sodium acrylate), allowing the introduction of the acidic groups in one step only. Finally, dispersions of TiO 2 -polymer particles in black dyed paraffin oil have successfully been applied in an A 4 -sized segmented electrophoretic display panel...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>ink</b> based on a {{microencapsulated}} electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E

Study Design: A longitudinal, experimental study of handwriting-, literacy- and motor skill development of primary school children. Place and Duration of Study: Two parallel classrooms of a mainstream medium-sized primary school in the Netherlands participated, covering the first three years of handwriting education. Methodology: General performances and intercorrelations between developing spelling, reading and handwriting skills were assessed for 32 children (15 girls and 17 boys). A standardized handwriting assessment scale was used to measure handwriting speed performance, a non-linguistic loop-writing task, using an <b>electronic</b> <b>inking</b> pen and a digitizer evaluated motor performance. Reading- and spelling performance was extracted from a national, school-based follow-up system, used by teachers. Results: At group level the results showed an increase in performance for all measures, the performance of the children showed considerable variation. Spelling and reading were positively related within all grades (P =. 004;. 000 and. 005 respectively). Handwriting and reading were positively related within Grade 1 only (P =. 003), handwriting and spelling were positively related in Grades 1 and 2 (P =. 004 and. 001 respectively). The amplitude errors in loop-writing were negatively related to both language measures in Grade 1 (for reading P =. 007, for spelling P =. 004). Conclusion: To broaden the view on developing handwriting problems in individual primary school children, it is advised to assess spelling and reading skills as well as motor skills, especially in the second and third grade...|$|R
