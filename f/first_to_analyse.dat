He {{was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> emblem glyphs in detail and in terms of their political and hierarchical associations. His proposed identification of four major or prime emblem glyphs was later expanded upon by Joyce Marcus, and the Barthel-Marcus quadripartite partitioning of Classic era Maya sites into four regional capitals and an associated hierarchy of four levels of site importance, became an influential concept in Mayanist research.|$|E

Basing his D.Litt. thesis A phonetic and phonological study of the word in Urdu on Firth's theory, he carried out research that was published in 1954. It was translated into Urdu by Professor Mirza Khalil Ahmad Beg under the title Urdu Lafz ka Sautiyati aur Tajz-sautiyati Mutalia, and was published by the Department of Linguistics, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh in 1984.|$|E

In total, the whole procedure could be completed in 4  h as opposed to up to 3  days required for the traditional, phenotypic tests. Further it requires minimal quantity of genomic DNA. Although {{this is not the}} <b>first</b> study <b>to</b> use duplex PCR to identify and distinguish C. dubliniensis and C. albicans, but it is the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyses</b> oral samples directly through rinse pellet analysis, and samples from a Sri Lankan diabetic population using duplex PCR.|$|R

5000|$|The usual view of {{scholars}} {{is that the}} painting was commissioned to celebrate a marriage, and is a relatively uncomplicated representation of sensual pleasure, with an added meaning of love conquering or outlasting war. [...] This was a commonplace in Renaissance thinking, which might be elaborated in terms of Renaissance Neoplatonism. [...] As with the other mythologies, Ernst Gombrich and Edgar Wind were the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> the painting in these terms. The couple's relationship could also be considered in terms of astrology, in which Mars is, according to Marsilio Ficino, [...] "outstanding in strength among the planets, because he makes men stronger, but Venus masters him ...she seems to master Mars, but Mars never masters Venus".|$|E
50|$|In his treatise, Breve trattato delle cause che possono far abbondare li regni d’oro e d’argento dove non sono miniere, Serra {{analysed}} {{the causes}} of the shortage of coin in the Kingdom of Naples and the factors that could have reversed this economic trend. He was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> and fully understand the concept of balance of trade for both visible goods and invisible services and capital movements. He explained how the shortage of coin in the Kingdom of Naples was due to balance of payments deficit. Using his findings he was able to reject the popular idea {{at the time that the}} scarcity in money was due to the exchange rate. The solution to the problem was found in the active encouragement of exports.|$|E
5000|$|Virchow was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> hair in {{criminal}} investigation, {{and made the}} first forensic report on it in 1861. He was called as an expert witness in a murder case, and he used hair samples collected from the victim. He became the first to recognise the limitation of hair as a conclusive evidence. He found that hairs can be different in an individual, and individual hair has characteristic features, and that hairs from different individuals can be strikingly similar. He concluded that evidence based on hair analysis is inconclusive. His testimony runs: The hairs found on the defendant do not possess any so pronounced peculiarities or individualities {{so that no one}} with certainty has the right to assert that they must have originated from the head of the victim.|$|E

50|$|Gray, {{the first}} musicologist {{to write on}} the {{structure}} of the Fifth Symphony, makes no mention of sonata form in his discussion, yet refers to the existence of two different subjects that seems to imply that he feels the movement is in sonata form. Abraham is one of the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> the work in terms of sonata form and clearly lays out where he believes each section begins and why. He shows that the work opens with a double exposition, each with distinct A- and B-group material, then moves into the development of this material. He explains the distinctly melodic section beginning at the ‘’Allegro moderato’’ as a Scherzo and Trio used as a substitute for {{the second half of the}} development. However, Layton disagrees with Abraham and considers the Scherzo to be the beginning of the recapitulation.|$|E
5000|$|Davidson Sylvester Hector Willoughby Nicol or Abioseh Nicol (14 September 1924 [...] - [...] 20 September 1994) was a Sierra Leonean academic, diplomat, physician, {{writer and}} poet. He has been {{considered}} as one of Sierra Leone’s most educated and greatest citizens of the twentieth century, as {{he was able to}} secure degrees in the arts, science and commercial disciplines and he contributed to science, history, and literature.. Nicol was the first African to graduate with First Class Honours from the University of Cambridge and he was also the first African elected as a Fellow of a college of Cambridge University. Described by one scholar as a polymath, Davidson Nicol significantly contributed to medical science when he was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> the breakdown of insulin in the human body, a discovery which was a breakthrough for the treatment of diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{research}} Knoblauch focusses on various fields within {{theoretical and empirical}} sociology. He developed his own approach to the investigation of social interaction called focused ethnography. [...] In contrast to “classic” ethnography {{this does not include}} prolonged stays in foreign cultures, but relies on video recordings of specialized fields within the researchers own society. The combination between video analysis and focused ethnography was elaborated as “videography”.Another major field of his work is the sociology of religion, where he advocates for a broad understanding of {{the role of religion in}} modern society. Building on Luckmann’s “invisible religion”, he was one of the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>analyse</b> the new forms of spirituality and developed the idea of a mediatized, event- and experience based “popular religion”.Next to his contribion in re-establishing the sociology of knowledge in German speaking sociology, communication was a crucial reference point for his work. While he analysed communication processes already in his dissertation on dowsing and divination, in his habilitation thesis “Kommunikationskultur: Die kommunikative Konstrutkion kultureller Kontexte” (translation: Communication Culture: The Communicative Construction of Cultural Contexts) he elaborated a theoretical framework which came to be known as “Communicative Constructivism”. Based on the “The Social Construction of Reality” by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, this approach includes bodily performances and material “objectivations” as “the missing analytical link which allows one to turn social into communicative action”. Without being reduced to speech acts, “communicative action" [...] becomes “the basic process in the social construction of reality”.|$|E
