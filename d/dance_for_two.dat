5000|$|In 1935, Agrippina Vaganova {{staged a}} new {{production}} of La Esmeralda for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, {{as the company}} and the city were then known. She created a new, bravura pas de deux for Diana and Actaeon, joining the names of the modest Roman goddess and the hapless Greek hunter. She included a few spectacular [...] "stag leaps" [...] for the male dancer, but she largely abandoned the well-known story of Actaeon in creating this divertissement and made instead a rapturous <b>dance</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> lovers, set to music by Pugni. Diana is seen as the beautiful goddess of the moon and the hunt, usually wearing a wispy red chiton and carrying a small golden bow; Actaeon is portrayed as a strong, handsome, mortal youth, clad in a short chiton or loincloth. At the premiere, Diana was danced by Galina Ulanova and Actaeon by Vaktang Chabukiani. Vaganova's popular pas de deux, which might have been better called Diana and Endymion, is still performed today as a spectacular showpiece for a ballerina and her partner.|$|E
