In my opinion, the first option is much more used because the public does not know the advantages of public auctions. In my bachelor's thesis I compare the public auctions under the Act on Public Auctions to the court <b>distrainer</b> auctions under the Civil Procedure Code and Execution Procedure. In the first and second part I describe both auction systems. In the other part I highlight the major differences of both systems. In the last part I assess chosen elements, explain the advantages and disadvantages of both systems and suggest possible modifications for greater effectiveness of the auctions...|$|E

Where relevant legal opinions on a particular matter varied, I recorded this plurality of opinions and, at the same time, I formulated my own stance. As the topic of my thesis consisted in studying applicable law, I heavily stressed that account should be taken of any decisions of general courts {{as well as of the}} Constitutional Court. Where the court case-law had been developing over the years and either inconsistent or even contradictory legal [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Since 2001, the {{legislation}} on enforcement has been fundamentally changed, on 1 st 2001, Act No. 120 / 2001 Coll., Executors and Enforcement Activities (Enforcement Code) entered into force. The creditor has thus {{been given the}} opportunity to decide how recover his claim. Until then, his only possibility for recovering claims was through the court, but since this date he could acquire his rights through the services of a distrainer. In 2012, this duality was abolished and is executed in most cases by private <b>distrainer.</b> He carries out his activity for reward, which results in his status as an entrepreneur. And his reward has been a thorny issue since 2001, when the profession came into our systhem. The issue of this topic is also evidenced by the parliamentary bill, which tries to regulate to reduce the distrainer`s tariff. The thesis compares the current situation in the Czech Republic with selected states. For purposes of this thesis, I chose Germany, because there is recovery of debts through a state employee, France because this system {{is one of the oldest}} and served as a model for many states and Slovakia, for reasons of common history and amendment that came into force in April this year. The aim of the thesis is to map the situation in selected states, to find possible deviations and sources of inspiration for the system of executive services in the territory of the Czech Republic...|$|E
