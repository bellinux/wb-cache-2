5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} mantled howler {{along the edges}} of its range in Mexico and Guatemala near the Yucatan Peninsula. [...] One theory for how this sympatry occurred and why the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler has such a restricted range is the ancestors of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler and the Central American squirrel monkey migrated to Central America from South America during the late Miocene or Pliocene. However, passage through the Isthmus of Panama then closed for a period due to rising sea levels, and later opened up to another wave of migration about two million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the restricted range of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler (and the Central American squirrel monkey).|$|R
50|$|Other mammals in {{the reserve}} include the red brocket (Mazama americana), the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler (Alouatta pigra) and Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler is {{the largest}} of the howler monkey species and one of {{the largest of the}} New World monkeys. <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler males are larger than those of any other Central American monkey species. On average, males weigh 11.4 kg and females weigh 6.4 kg. [...] The body is between 521 and 639 mm in length, {{excluding}} the tail. [...] The tail is between 590 and 690 mm long. Adults of both sexes have long, black hair and a prehensile tail, while infants have brown fur. [...] Males over four months old have white scrotums.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler {{belongs to}} the New World monkey family Atelidae, which {{contains}} howler monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis. It {{is a member of}} the howler monkey genus Alouatta. No subspecies are recognized.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler's diet {{includes}} mostly {{leaves and}} fruit. Flowers also {{make up a}} small part of the diet. The breadnut tree can provide as much as 86% of the monkey's diet during some seasons.|$|R
5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} howler monkey species, the {{majority}} of the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler's day is spent resting. Eating makes up {{about a quarter of the}} day, moving about 10% of the day, and the remainder of the day is spent in socializing and other activities.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler, or Yucatan black howler, (Alouatta pigra) is {{a species}} of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, from Central America. It is found in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, in and near the Yucatan Peninsula. It lives in evergreen, semideciduous and lowland rain forests. [...] It {{is also known as}} the baboon in Belize, {{although}} it is not closely related to the baboons in Africa.|$|R
50|$|Its {{most common}} species include macaw, parrot, and tapirs. The harpy eagle also calls this {{national}} park home. It is {{noted for its}} incredible genetic value. The park is home to regional endemic species and some that are so rare and endangered that {{they are on the}} IUCN Red List. These species include the spotted paca, <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler, night monkey, black-headed spider monkey, jaguar, ocelot, Central American agouti, American crocodile and the capybara.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler is diurnal and arboreal. It {{lives in}} groups of {{generally}} one or two adult males, with a ratio of about 1.3 females for every male. Groups generally have between two and 10 members, including juveniles, but groups as large as 16 members have been studied. [...] The home range is between 3 and 25 hectares. [...] Population density can exceed 250 monkeys per square kilometer in the Community Baboon Sanctuary in Belize.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler shares several adaptations {{with other}} species of howler monkey that allow it to pursue a folivorous diet (mostly leaves). Its molars have high {{shearing}} crests, to help it eat the leaves, and the male of the species has an enlarged hyoid bone near the vocal cords. [...] This hyoid bone amplifies the male howler's calls, allowing it to locate other males without expending much energy, which is important, since leaves are a low-energy food. Howling occurs primarily at dawn and at dusk.|$|R
50|$|The {{biosphere}} {{is home to}} 86 {{species of}} mammals, 18 {{of which can be}} found in the Official Registry of Mexican Ecology, a resource that outlines flora and fauna that are in danger of extinction, rare, threatened or are under protection. The area is home to 5 of the 6 large cats that are native to Mexico. This includes its small but healthy population of jaguars as well as jaguarundis, ocelots, pumas and margays. The fauna also includes Central American agoutis, Geoffroy's spider monkeys, <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howlers, Baird's tapir, white-nosed coatis, ocellated turkeys, crested guans, toucans, and green parrots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{park and}} {{adjacent}} buffer zone (known as [...] "Eco-región Lachuá") is {{noted for its}} high biodiversity. With 120 species of mammals (50% of mammal species found in Guatemala), 30-40 species of reptiles, 177 bird species (40% of bird species in Guatemala), and 36 fish species it is a sanctuary for a varied fauna population. These include fish like the diadromous tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), an ample variety of biogegraphically endemic Cichlid species, reptiles like Morelet's Crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii), Orangebelly Swamp Snake (Tretanorhinus nigroluteus); and mammals, like the Jaguar (Panthera onca), Cougar (Puma concolor), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), the White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu pecari), Spotted Paca (Agouti paca), Red Brocket (Mazama americana), and Spix's Disk-winged Bat (Thyroptera tricolor), and various monkeys species including the endangered <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>Black</b> Howler (Alouatta pigra).|$|R
25|$|Monkey River is {{a coastal}} {{watercourse}} in southern Belize that {{rises in the}} Maya Mountains and discharges to the Caribbean Sea near Monkey River Town. One of Belize's major rivers, Monkey River has northern headwaters which originate in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the Swasey Branch drains the East Basin of that wildlife sanctuary. Further south, the Bladen Branch watercourse drains the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains including the ancient Mayan settlement areas of Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. These two watercourses join to form the Monkey River approximately 16 kilometres upstream {{from the mouth of}} the Monkey River. The Monkey River is readily navigated throughout the year using small boats, but navigation above the major confluence (of Bladen and Swasey Branches) becomes more difficult due to lack of depth when the dry season starts about February. Habitats in this watershed provide cover for such diverse species as the ocelot, jaguar, <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler, bare-throated tiger heron, Morelet's crocodile, fer-de-lance and manatee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mantled howler}} {{is native to}} Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. Within Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, the mantled howler is found in {{locations}} throughout the countries. In Colombia and Ecuador, it is found in a narrow corridor bordered by the Pacific Ocean {{to the west and}} the Andes Mountains to the east and also in Colombia in a small area near the Caribbean Sea close to the Panama border. In Guatemala, the mantled howler is found through {{the central part of the}} country, and into southeastern Mexico south of the Yucatán Peninsula. The mantled howler is among the most commonly seen and heard primates in many Central American national parks, including Manuel Antonio, Corcovado, Monteverde and Soberania. The mantled howler lives in several different types of forest, including secondary forest and semi-deciduous forest but is found in higher densities in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest. [...] The mantled howler is sympatric with another howler monkey species, the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>black</b> howler, A. pigra, over a small part of its range, in Guatemala and Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|Nestor Rodriguez, {{author of}} [...] "Hispanic and Asian Immigration Waves in Houston," [...] wrote {{that for the}} Central American {{immigrants}} their [...] "national identities {{became the basis for}} their residential, workplace, and recreational groupings in Central American settlement areas." [...] For instance Guatemalan Mayans settled in distinct areas separated by their regional backgrounds and native languages, separate from other <b>Guatemalan</b> immigrants. Garifuna-speaking <b>Black</b> Caribs (Garifuna Americans) from Belize and Honduras settled in different areas depending on whether they identified more with their black race or their Hispanic ethnicity. If they identified with the race more they settled with African-Americans. If they identified more with the Hispanic ethnicity they settled with Central Americans. In 1990 the median household income of Central Americans was $17,429 and 6% of those aged 25 or older had a bachelor's degree.|$|R
