There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves {{he had seen in}} twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the farmers are still practising the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity.

25|$|When a {{hand loom}} {{was located in}} the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult.

25|$|The two {{elements}} of platforms are constant and non-constant.

Failure to do so negates the purpose of platform sharing in that it increases costs as opposed to reducing them.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, even {{plans that}} {{reduce the number}} of uninsured today may find that those gains will {{disappear}} in a few years if costs continue to grow much faster than gross domestic product. As costs rise, many companies will drop insurance and pay the modest taxes or fees that have been proposed. States will find that costs exceed revenue and that cuts will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{as part of}} a {{staff report}} on {{condition}} the Gardiner, City staff reported to Council that a decision on the eastern segment would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> The section was identified by staff as having reached the end of its lifespan, unless a significant rebuild were to be done.

25|$|Truly {{changing}} one's last name, {{as opposed}} to adopting a usage name, is quite complex. Such changes <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> official by a décret en Conseil d'État taken by the Prime Minister after approbation by the Council of State. Requests for such changes must be justified by some legitimate interest, for instance, changing from a foreign name difficult to pronounce in French to a simpler name or changing from a name with unfavorable connotations.|$|E
25|$|As device {{management}} {{is a very}} OS-specific topic, these drivers are handled differently by each kind of kernel design, but in every case, the kernel has to provide the I/O to allow drivers to physically access their devices through some port or memory location. Very important decisions <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> when designing the device management system, as in some designs accesses may involve context switches, making the operation very CPU-intensive and easily causing a significant performance overhead.|$|E
25|$|Modern track {{typically}} uses hot-rolled steel with {{a profile}} of an asymmetrical rounded I-beam.
