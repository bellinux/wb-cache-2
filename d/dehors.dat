25|$|One {{fine example}} {{of the use of}} sacres as {{different}} word classes is a dialogue by 'Les Cyniques' called Le cours de sacres. The phrase Jules, étant irrité, a expulsé violemment Jacques qui était en colère ("Jules, who was irritated, violently ejected Jacques who was angry") becomes Le sacrament qui était en calvaire a calissé <b>dehors</b> l'ostie en tabarnak.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, 1932 {{the great}} pedagogue of the Soviet Ballet Agrippina Vaganova {{presented}} {{her version of}} La Bayadère for the Kirov Ballet (the former Imperial Ballet). Vaganova revised the ballerina's dances for her star pupil Marina Semenova, who danced Nikiya. This included triple pirouettes sur la pointe (on the toes), and fast piqué turns en <b>dehors.</b> Although Vaganova's revival did not find a permanent place in the repertory, her modifications to the Ballerina's dances would become the standard.|$|E
500|$|Secret trusts do {{not comply}} with the {{formality}} requirements (such as witnessing) laid down in the Wills Act 1837. Despite this, the courts have chosen to uphold them as valid. Although various justifications have been given for this, they are generally categorised as either based on preventing fraud, or as regarding secret trusts as outside (<b>dehors)</b> {{the operation of the}} Wills Act. The first is considered the traditional approach [...] if the courts do not recognise secret trusts, the trustee given the property in the will would be able to keep it for himself, committing fraud. The fraud theory utilises the equitable maxim that [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud". A more modern view is that secret trusts exist outside the will altogether, and thus do not have to comply with it. Accepting this theory would undermine the operation of the Wills Act, since the Wills Act is designed to cover all testamentary dispositions. To avoid this problem, one approach has been to reclassify the secret trust as inter vivos ("between the living") but this creates other problems. There have also been attempts to conclude that half-secret trusts rest on a different basis to fully secret trusts, although this has been disapproved by the House of Lords, primarily on practical grounds.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the <b>dehors</b> theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|Han Ryner was a French individualist anarchist {{philosopher and}} activist and a novelist. [...] He wrote for {{publications}} such as L'Art social, L'Humanité nouvelle, L'Ennemi du Peuple, L'Idée Libre de Lorulot; and L'En <b>dehors</b> and L'Unique. His thought is mainly influenced by stoicism and epicureanism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 the General Assembly {{extended}} the writ of coram nobis to criminal proceedings.

[...] The statute provided only that criminal coram nobis proceedings were to be governed by the same rules and procedure applicable to the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of these}} new {{compounds}} appear in literary texts during the late empire; French <b>dehors,</b> Spanish de fuera and Portuguese de fora ("outside") all represent de + foris (Romanian afară – ad + foris), and we find Jerome writing stulti, nonne qui fecit, quod de foris est, etiam id, quod de intus est fecit? (Luke 11.40: [...] "ye fools, did not he, that made which is without, make that which is within also?"). In some cases, compounds were created by combining {{a large number of}} particles, such as the Romanian adineauri ("just recently") from ad + de + in + illa + hora.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{also took}} place in Lake Garda, Bergamo, Montodine, and the area of Ripalta between countries. The main {{location}} for the Perlmans' residence was an uninhabited 17th-century mansion in Moscazzano. The director intially wanted to buy the house but couldn’t afford it, so he made a film at the place instead. Six weeks before production, the crew—including production designers Samuel <b>Dehors</b> and Violante Visconti di Modrone—gradually decorated the house with furniture, objects, and decoration inspired by the characters. [...] "We created an interior that expressed how this family of intellectuals, of cosmopolitan people, lived in this way," [...] Guadagnino said. The swimming pool used in the film was recreated from a watering trough common in the area. Guadagnino didn't want the film to [...] "look like a reflection on the 80s, [...] when it becomes period." [...] His team did extensive research, with an assist from the residents of Crema, by entering people's houses and collecting their pictures of the '80s.|$|E

6000|$|The next point, however, {{on which}} I shall be opposed, is one on which I speak with far less confidence, {{for in this}} Saussure himself is against me,--namely, the {{parallelism}} of the beds sloping under the Mont Blanc. Saussure states twice, §§ 656, 677, that they are arranged {{in the form of}} a fan. I can only repeat that every measurement and every drawing I made in Chamouni led me to the conclusions stated in the text, and so I leave the subject to better investigators; this one fact being indisputable, and the only one on which for my purpose it is necessary to insist, that, whether in Chamouni the beds be radiant or not, to an artist's eye they are usually parallel; and throughout the Alps no phenomenon is more constant than the rounding of surfaces across the extremities of beds sloping outwards, as seen in my plates +37+, +40+, and +48+, and this especially in the most majestic mountain masses. Compare De Saussure of the Grimsel, § 1712: [...] "Toujours il est bien remarquable que ces feuillets, verticaux au sommet, s'inclinent ensuite, comme à Chamouni, contre le <b>dehors</b> de la montagne:" [...] and again of the granite at Guttannen, § 1679: [...] "Ces couches ne sont pas tout-a-fait verticales; elles s'appuyent un peu contre le Nord-Est, ou, comme à Chamouni, contre le <b>dehors</b> de la montagne." [...] Again, of the [...] "quartz micacé" [...] of Zumloch, § 1723: [...] "Ces rochers sont en couches à peu près verticales, dont les plans courent du Nord-Est au Sud-Ouest, en s'appuyant, suivant l'usage, contre l'extérieur de la montagne, ou contre la vallée." [...] Again, on the Pass of the Griés, § 1738: [...] "Le rocher présente des couches d'un schiste micacé rayé comme une étoffe; comme de l'autre côté ils surplombent vers le <b>dehors</b> de la montagne." [...] Without referring to other passages I think Saussure's simple words, [...] "suivant l'usage," [...] are enough to justify my statement in Chap. XIV. § 3; only the reader must of course always remember that every conceivable position of beds takes place in the Alps, and all I mean to assert generally is, that where the masses are most enormous and impressive, and formed of slaty crystalline rocks, there the run of the beds up, as it were, from within the mountain to its surface, will, in all probability, become a notable feature in the scene as regarded by an artist. One somewhat unusual form assumed by horizontal beds of slaty crystallines, or of granite, is described by Saussure with unusual admiration; and the passage is worth extracting, as bearing on the terraced ideal of rocks in the middle ages. The scene is in the Val Formazza.|$|E
