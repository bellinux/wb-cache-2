The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well.

40|$|A long-standing open {{problem in}} {{cryptography}} is proving {{the existence of}} (deterministic) hardcore predicates for the Diffie-Hellman problem defined over finite fields. In this paper we make progress on this problem by defining a very natural variation of the Diffie-Hellman problem over Fp 2 and proving the unpredictability <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> bit <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the coordinates of the secret DH value. To achieve our result we modify an idea presented at CRYPTO’ 01 by Boneh and Shparlinski [4] originally developed {{to prove that the}} LSB of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. We extend this idea in two novel ways: 1. We generalize it to the case of finite fields F p 2; 2. We prove that any bit, not just the LSB, is hard using the list decoding techniques of Akavia et al. [1] (FOCS’ 03) as generalized at CRYPTO’ 12 by Duc and Jetchev [6]. In the process we prove several other interesting results: • Our result hold also for a larger class of predicates, called segment predicates in [1]; • We extend the result of Boneh and Shparlinski to prove that every bit (and every segment predicate) of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem is hard-core; • We define the notion of partial one-way function over finite fields Fp 2 and prove that every bit (and every segment predicate) <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the input coordinate for these functions is hard-core...|$|R

5000|$|This brutal {{vision of}} the human {{condition}} stuck with Westermann and resulted in his very bleak and anti-militaristic worldview: that everyone is alone in a world run by events beyond anyone’s control. [...] The clearest depiction of this philosophy is seen in his aforementioned “Death Ships” series, a collection of sculptures and painting depicting bombed out husks of ships, usually set aflame, surrounded by ominous shark fins in the ocean. [...] Even his later works retain this same theme of human helplessness, as they usually revolve around some scenario involving impending doom for the subject. Adding to this common theme, Gregory, Westermann’s son, enlisted in the Marines and served in the Vietnam War, a decision that Westermann strongly opposed, as he did the war. [...] Seeing his son serve in such a conflict only resulted in strengthening his own anti-militaristic views further. His “Antimobile” work also took on a contemptuous anti-materialism tone, which is seen in his growingly anti-consumerism views. [...] Westermann criticized the growing lack of craftsmanship in modern industry and the increase of machine made products. He mentioned the “depersonalization of society by the machine” as a major influence of his adult artistic career. [...] In contrast, his works all bear the same meticulous attention to detail and overall high levels of personal craftsmanship. <b>Every</b> <b>single</b> piece <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Westermann’s sculptures is hand filed and finished, with the same attention to detail given to the inner, unseen components as the outer finish.|$|R

60|$|A tall variety, bearing large, {{almost white}} flowers blotched with crimson, {{appeared}} amongst the intercrossed and self-fertilised plants {{of the third}} and fourth generations. This variety increased so rapidly, that in the sixth generation <b>of</b> self-fertilised plants <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> consisted <b>of</b> it. So it was with all the many plants which were raised, up to the last or ninth self-fertilised generation. Although this variety first appeared amongst the intercrossed plants, yet from their offspring being intercrossed in each succeeding generation, it never prevailed amongst them; and the flowers on the several intercrossed plants of the ninth generation differed considerably in colour. On the other hand, the uniformity in colour of the flowers on the plants of all the later self-fertilised generations was quite surprising; on a casual inspection they might have been said to be quite alike, but the crimson blotches were not of exactly the same shape, or in exactly the same position. Both my gardener and myself believe that this variety did not appear amongst the parent-plants, raised from purchased seeds, but from its appearance amongst both the crossed and self-fertilised plants of {{the third and fourth}} generations; and from what I have seen of the variation of this species on other occasions, it is probable that it would occasionally appear under any circumstances. We learn, however, from the present case that under the peculiar conditions to which my plants were subjected, this particular variety, remarkable for its colouring, largeness of the corolla, and increased height of the whole plant, prevailed in the sixth and all the succeeding self-fertilised generations to the complete exclusion of every other variety.|$|R

Due to lack of {{standards}} and various requirements, the battery systems have to be specifically designed for each application. This need for a specific design also affects the battery monitoring circuit. In order to reduce design effort, distributed battery monitoring systems integrated into the cells were proposed. Economies of scale allow these circuits to be produced at low cost per unit as they will be needed in <b>every</b> <b>single</b> battery cell. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the major challenges of the distributed battery monitoring concept is the communication link for the monitoring circuits: it has to be robust, reliable, and easy to install.

Relevant influence factors of the physical implementation on a capacitive voltage divider determining the transmitted data signal are identified and evaluated, considering application specific constraints. As a result, a suitable signal conditioning circuit using frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation is proposed and experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation of the proposed circuit are presented...|$|R

40|$|Fifty {{years ago}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{greatest}} breakthroughs in computer programming {{and in the}} history of computers happened – the appearance of FORTRAN, the first higher-order programming lan- guage. From that time until now hundreds of programming languages were invented, different programming paradigms were defined, all with the main goal to make computer programming easier and closer to as many people as possible. Many battles were fought among scientists as well as among developers around concepts of programming, programming languages and paradigms. It can be said that programming paradigms and programming languages were very often a trigger for many changes and improvements in computer science as well as in computer industry. Definitely, computer programming is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cornerstones of computer science. Today there are many tools that give a help in the process of programming, but there is still a programming tasks that can be solved only manually. Therefore, programming is still <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most creative parts of interaction with computers. Programmers should chose programming language in accordance to task they have to solve, but very often, they chose it in accordance to their personal preferences, their beliefs and many other subjective reasons. Nevertheless, the market of programming languages can be merciless to languages as history was merciless to some people, even whole nations. Programming languages and developers get born, live and die leaving more or less tracks and successors, and not always the best survives. The history of programming languages is closely connected to the history of computers and computer science itself. <b>Every</b> <b>single</b> thing from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them has its reflexions onto the other.

40|$|The {{system for}} {{handling}} {{and treatment of}} organic waste is very large and complex, especially in urban areas. It consists of numerous transports, different treatments and different use of residual products. This system also interacts with several other technical systems in society, e. g., district heating, handling of other wastes and material for re-use, and agriculture as a receiver of residues. The complexity of the system under study makes a systematic approach necessary to get the appropriate overview, {{which has led to}} the construction of the simulation model ORWARE (Organic Waste Research). This model is intended as a means of analysing the environmental impact, use of resources, and energy turnover of the handling system for organic waste. The model consists of treatment facilities for waste in the system as well as all the transports necessary for collecting the waste and transport residual products to landfills or arable land. ORWARE is modular, all sub-models can be connected to each other. The sub-models developed are: • Sewage plant • Incineration • Landfill • Composting • Anaerobic digestion • Transports • Spreading of residues on arable land ORWARE is used as a scenario tool, the scenarios that are to be studied are constructed by connecting the sub-models needed to represent the scenario and a simulation is performed. An analysis of a region consists of simulation of several scenarios and then evaluation mainly {{of the differences between the}} results. The results from the model are: • Air emissions from the entire system • Water emissions from the entire system • Energy turnover for the entire system • Amount of plant nutrients and contaminants recycled to arable land These total emissions can also, in the analysis of the results, be presented as emission/energy turnover/plant nutrient recycled, from <b>every</b> <b>single</b> source. <b>One</b> way <b>of</b> making the results easier to analyse, is to use Life Cycle Assessment methodology to group the emissions into several environmental effect categories, and this is what have been done in the case studies performed.

The models are static and the results from a simulation depend only on the flow of material into the models. The model works with a variable vector consisting of 43 elements.
