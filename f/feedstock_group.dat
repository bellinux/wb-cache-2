40|$|Abstract For {{lignocellulosic}} bioenergy {{to become}} {{a viable alternative to}} traditional energy production methods, rapid increases in conversion efficiency and biomass yield must be achieved. Increased productivity in bioenergy production can be achieved through concomitant gains in processing efficiency as well as genetic improvement of feedstock that have the potential for bioenergy production at an industrial scale. The purpose of this review is to explore the genetic and genomic resource landscape for the improvement of a specific bioenergy <b>feedstock</b> <b>group,</b> the C 4 bioenergy grasses. First, bioenergy grass feedstock traits relevant to biochemical conversion are examined. Then we outline genetic resources available bioenergy grasses for mapping bioenergy traits to DNA markers and genes. This is followed by a discussion of genomic tools and how they can be applied to understanding bioenergy grass feedstock trait genetic mechanisms leading to further improvement opportunities. </p...|$|E

40|$|IIASA's agro-ecological zones {{modelling}} framework {{has been}} extended for biofuel productivity assessments distinguishing five main <b>groups</b> of <b>feedstocks</b> covering {{a wide range of}} agronomic conditions and energy production pathways, namely: woody lignocellulosic plants, herbaceous lignocellulosic plants, oil crops, starch crops and sugar crops. A uniform Pan-European land resources database was compiled at the spatial resolution of 1 km 2. Suitability and productivity assessments were carried out by matching climate characteristics with plant requirements, calculating annual biomass increments or yields including consideration of soil and terrain characteristics of each grid-cell. Potential biomass productivity and associated energy yields were calculated for each grid-cell. Spatial distributions of suitabilities of biofuel feedstocks in Europe were generated for each individual feedstock {{as well as for the}} five biofuel <b>feedstock</b> <b>groups.</b> Estimated agronomical attainable yields, both in terms of biomass (kg ha- 1) as well as biofuel energy equivalent (GJ ha- 1), were mapped and tabulated by agriculture and pasture land cover classes as derived from the CORINE land cover database. Results have been further aggregated by administrative units at NUTS 2 level...|$|R
40|$|Steam-cracking is energetically {{intensive}} large-scaled {{process which}} transforms {{a wide range}} of hydrocarbons feedstock to petrochemical products. The dependence of products yields on feedstock composition and reaction conditions has been successfully described by mathematical models which are very useful tools for the optimization of cracker operation. Remaining problem is to formulate objective function for such an optimization. Quantitative criterion based on the process economy is proposed in this paper. Previously developed and verified industrial steam-cracking semi-mechanistic model is utilized as supporting tool for economic evaluation of selected gasoline feedstock. Economic criterion is established as the difference between value of products obtained by cracking of studied feedstock under given conditions and the value of products obtained by cracking of reference feedstock under reference conditions. As an example of method utilization, optimal reaction conditions were searched for each of selected feedstock. Potential benefit of individual cracking and cracking of <b>grouped</b> <b>feedstocks</b> in the contrast to cracking under the middle of optimums is evaluated and also compared to cracking under usual conditions...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{preclinical}} and clinical studies are utilizing pDNA (plasmid DNA) as the vector. In addition, {{there has been}} a growing trend towards larger and larger doses of pDNA utilized in human trials. The growing demand on pDNA manufacture leads to pressure to make more in less time. A key intervention has been the use of monoliths as stationary phases in liquid chromatography. Monolithic stationary phases offer fast separation to pDNA owing to their large pore size, making pDNA in the size range from 100 nm to over 300 nm easily accessible. However, the convective transport mechanism of monoliths does not guarantee plasmid purity. The recovery of pure pDNA hinges on a proper balance in the properties of the adsorbent phase, the mobile phase and the feedstock. The effects of pH and ionic strength of binding buffer, temperature of <b>feedstock,</b> active <b>group</b> density and the pore size of the stationary phase were considered as avenues to improve the recovery and purity of pDNA using a methacrylate-based monolithic adsorbent and Escherichia coli DH 5 α-pUC 19 clarified lysate as feedstock. pDNA recovery was found to be critically dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the mobile phase. Up to a maximum of approx. 92 % recovery was obtained under optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength. Increasing the feedstock temperature to 80 °C increased the purity of pDNA owing to the extra thermal stability associated with pDNA over contaminants such as proteins. Results from toxicological studies of the plasmid samples using endotoxin standard (E. coli 0. 55 :B 5 lipopolysaccharide) show that endotoxin level decreases with increasing salt concentration. It was obvious that large quantities of pure pDNA can be obtained with minimal extra effort simply by optimizing process parameters and conditions for pDNA purification...|$|R
