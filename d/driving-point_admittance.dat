This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{modeling}} bridge reflectances and body radiativity profiles as digital filters {{in the context of}} sound synthesis by digital waveguides. The model is based on modal analysis of bridge <b>driving-point</b> <b>admittance</b> measurements obtained experimentally. Digital filter coefficients are estimated from modal analysis parameters, which are obtained by an optimization process that minimizes the error between measured and synthesized admittances, and between measured and synthesized radiativity profiles. Filter coefficients are then used in a digital waveguide synthesis model to render plucked string sounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{detectable}} natural frequencies in a frequency response governs {{the number of}} sections of the ladder network that can be constructed, starting from the measured frequency response data. This number, particularly in case of interleaved windings, is woefully small rendering the entire exercise pointless. An attempt is described wherein this physical resolution can be enhanced. This is achieved by augmenting the measured <b>driving-point</b> <b>admittance</b> data (of the interleaved winding) with information regarding natural frequencies that are observable, and hence extractable, from an additional measurement of the open-circuited neutral-end voltage spectrum. By this process, a few more additional natural frequencies become available for processing, resulting in a ladder network with an increased physical resolution, i. e., more number of sections. Measurements done on an actual interleaved winding are presented to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the symmetrical linear antenna driven by a two-wire line is presented. Then symmetrical linear antenna and the feeder line are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous integral equations containing antenna and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent <b>driving-point</b> <b>admittance</b> is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground. Then theoretical results for admittances were compared with the experiments and remarkably good overall agreement has been found. On the contrary, a comparison with the corresponding theoretical results obtained with the idealized delta-function generator revealed remarkable discrepancies...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} for digital modeling of D-dimensional <b>driving-point</b> bridge <b>admittances</b> from vibration measurements on instruments of the violin family. Our study, {{centered around the}} two-dimensional case for violin, viola, and cello, is based on using the modal framework to construct an admittance formulation providing physically meaningful and effective control over model parameters. In a first stage, mode frequencies and bandwidths are estimated in the frequency domain via solving a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Then, mode amplitudes are estimated via semidefinite programming while enforcing passivity. We obtain accurate, low-order digital admittance models suited for real-time sound synthesis via physical models. 1...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Active {{transmission}} lines, a {{generalization of}} classical transmission lines, are useful electrical devices. They can be utilized to realize distributed amplifiers and to obtain other electrical characteristics unattainable with passive lines. Active lines have historical significance and model many physical processes including heat conduction in an internally heated material, a vibrating string, pressure waves in gas, neutron diffusion and fission, and semiconductor photodetection. This paper fully develops {{the analysis and}} synthesis of active transmission lines using a network theory approach. An active line is characterized by distributed series voltage and shunt current sources {{in addition to the}} passive line parameters. These sources may be of independent and/or dependent type. It is shown that independent sources may be removed from the line if appropriate modifications' in port conditions are made. Extraction integrals are formulated for this purpose. Examples of independent sources include initial condition generators; they also occur in devices exhibiting active coupling such as the traveling-wave transistor. Dependent sources however change the two-port parameters of the active line. These sources have their outputs controlled by either line voltage or current (a source at position x has an output which depends on either voltage or current at position x). Two basic types of lines are therefore possible. The uniform active line having dependent distributed sources is completely analyzed. Its traveling-wave characteristics including characteristic impedances and propagation functions are presented. Laplace transformation techniques are used to analyze the <b>driving-point</b> and transfer <b>admittances,</b> gain, bandwidth, step response, rise and delay time, and sensitivity of uniform rcg active lines. The general nature of the pole-zero patterns of nonuniform active lines having distributed dependent sources are investigated using several results from differential equation theory. Their two-port parameters are readily expressed using the basic set notation and self-adjoint properties of the active line equations. Lack of pole-zero cancellation is noted utilizing the Wronskian of the basic set solutions. Sturm-Liouville theory establishes the general pole-zero locations. many of the powerful theorems concerning lumped passive networks are seen to parallel those of active lines. Active transmission lines are readily synthesized directly in the time or frequency domain using variational calculus techniques. The parameter distributions required to produce specified port response for arbitrary excitations and loadings (consistent with parameter bounds, etc.) are generated by expressions involving voltage and current along the original line and a so-called adjoint line. The method is readily implemented by digital and hybrid computers. At the present time, active transmission lines cannot be realized because of the inability to distribute dependent sources along a passive line. Therefore artificial active lines are presently utilized The topology and two-port parameter requirements of the iterative two port are discussed. Future advances in solid-state electronics and thin-film technology should overcome this difficulty. Several current research studies involving semiconductor bulk effects and solid-state traveling-wave amplifiers are cited. Although this thesis is concerned with the class of active distributed network having an active transmission line equivalent, the various considerations are readily extendable to networks having other differential models. more generally then, this investigation is concerned with developing methods for analyzing and synthesizing active distributed networks...|$|R

The results available on the K-matrix and the adjoint network approach for sensitivity computations will form the basis of the discussions. THE P-MATRIX ONSIDER a resistive n-port network N. Let 4 = C {gi} denote the column matrix of edge conductances of N. We shall denote by Jo. = {gio} the nominal value of @., The sensitivity coefficient matrix P = [pii] with respect to the Y-matrix of N will be defined as follows: Pij = 218 =Oo I where yii is the short-circuit <b>driving-point</b> <b>admittance</b> across port i of N. Pij will be referred to as the sensitivity coefficient of yii with respect to the conductance gj. It may be seen that the matrix P is of order it x e, where e is the number of edges in N. Without any loss of generality the graph of the network N may be assumed to be complete by permitting edges with zero admittances. It follows from the results of [l], [2] that where vkj (a,‘) is th e voltage across conductance gk when port j(i) is excited with a source of unit voltage and all the other ports are short-circuited. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Hence we get Pik IO = 80 = Cvk’ 12 (3) as a consequence of the no amplification property of resistive networks pik I 1.
