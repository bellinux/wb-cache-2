As chronic HIV infection also influences <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> we determined the influence of HIV co-infection on coagulation, anticoagulation and the endothelium during sepsis or malaria. We performed a prospective observational study in 325 subjects with or without HIV infection (103 with sepsis, 127 with malaria and 95 asymptomatic controls) in an HIV endemic area in Central Africa. We measured plasma biomarkers indicative of activation of distinct <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Sepsis and malaria had similar effects with elevated markers of coagulation, reduced anticoagulation markers and activation of endothelium. In particular, asymptomatic HIV infection reduced the plasma levels of the anticoagulant co-factor free protein S, and increased activation of the vascular endothelium, which were not normalized by combination antiretroviral therapy. HIV co-infection during sepsis and malaria caused more profound changes in free protein S and von Willebrand factor in sepsis and malaria, and ADAMTS 13 in sepsis, while not influencing sepsis- or malaria-induced coagulation activation. These results show {{for the first time that}} HIV infection augments selective haemostatic changes during sepsis and malaria, which may contribute to the enhanced morbidity of these conditions in HIV patient...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS The <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanism</b> was {{investigated}} in 20 patients with renal failure, of whom nine had evidence of a bleeding tendency. A defect of platelet function {{was the most common}} finding. The effect of dialysis on the bleeding state is briefly discussed, and a scheme for the routine investiga-tion of haemostasis in renal failure is put forward. The occurrence of a bleeding diathesis as a complica-tion of renal failure has frequently been described. Recent advances in the management and prognosis of acute and chronic renal disease have made it desirable to undertake both a clinical appreciation and a thorough laboratory investigation of the incidence and nature of this complication. In patients in whom a bleeding tendency exists, or where surgery or needle biopsy is indicated, {{it would be a great}} advantage to know whether correction of the biochemical abnormalities would lessen the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications. The object of this study was to investigate the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanism</b> in an unselected group of uraemic patients. An attempt was made to relate the labora-tory results to the occurrence of clinical bleeding, and to the safety of biopsy techniques. In addition, some cases were re-assessed after alleviation of the uraemic state by dialysis. A number of workers have attempted to define the nature of the bleeding tendency, and a variety of abnormalities have been reported. Commonly, either thrombocytopenia (Altschuler, Marcus, and Ullman...|$|E

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), one of {{the most}} prevalent supra-ventricular arrhythmia in adults, is related to a substantial increase in the risk of thromboembolic events requiring tailored preventive strategy. In AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized according to a careful decision-making process, taking in account the likely concomitant presence of risk factors for stroke and bleeding. Anticoagulation management is particularly challenging in women with AF, to the extent that female sex is incorporated in commonly used stratification schemes for both thromboembolic and bleeding risk evaluation. Nevertheless, gender-based differences on the efficacy and safety of either "old" (i. e. vitamin K antagonist) or "new" oral anticoagulants (i. e. direct thrombin inhibitors and activated factor X inhibitors) are not conclusive and not always reported. This review aims to analyse the literature on sex differences in AF anticoagulation management. We focus on safety data, bleeding complications and specific <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> currently under investigation, which could account for observed disparities among sexes. Moreover, details on sex difference in response to anticoagulant treatment will be discussed. Comparing old and new antithrombotics, a need clearly emerges for differentiated and integrated strategies for the treatment of AF in female patients...|$|R
40|$|Testing for {{laboratory}} {{evidence of}} thrombophilia is now common {{but it has}} limited predictive value {{for the majority of}} unselected symptomatic patients. So when is testing indicated? And which one? The term "thrombophilia" describes disorders of the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which are likely to predispose to thrombosis. Thrombophilia may be heritable, acquired or mixed, resulting of the environment interacting with genetic background. To date, a limited number of genetic variants and other defects are proven to be independent risk factors for venous thromboembolism. These include antithrombin deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, factor V Leiden, the prothrombin gene mutation, hyperhomocysteinemia and antiphospholipid antibodies. There is no good evidence currently available to support the hypothesis that heritable thrombophilias increase the risk of arterial disease. But acquired or mixed thrombophilias such as hyperhomocysteinemia and anti-phospholipid antibodies have been found in association with both venous and arterial thrombotic disorders. When testing for thrombophilia is indicated, especially in case of venous thromboembolism, it should include assays for heritable, mixed or acquired defects: deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, factor V Leiden and prothrombin G 20210 A mutations, elevated factor VIII, hyperhomocysteinemia and for antiphospholipid antibodies. Depending on the site of venous thrombosis, laboratory testing to exclude myeloproliferative disorders should be performed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mortality}} rate {{in patients with}} upper gastrointestinal bleeding appears to be particularly related to re-bleeding. The <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that may influence the re-bleeding of ulcers are largely unknown. We studied and analysed fibrinolytic activity in bleeding ulcer patients {{and the effect of}} acid suppression on this activity. Fibrinolytic activity was analysed in mucosal biopsies from 29 bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer patients and six controls. We analysed levels of D-Dimer, fibrin plate lysis area, plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, and plasmin antiplasmin complexes. Significantly more fibrinolytic activity was detected in biopsies from patients with bleeding ulcers compared to controls. Moreover, in patients with endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage, mucosal fibrinolytic activity was higher compared to patients without stigmata of recent haemorrhage. In mucosal biopsies of patients that had used acid suppression before admission, a decreased fibrinolytic activity was found compared to patients without such therapy. This effect of acid suppression on fibrinolytic activity was confirmed in nine patients before and after a 24 -h ranitidine infusion.

40|$|The {{ability of}} low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) to inhibit the procoagulant activity of tissue factor is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction involving apolipoprotein (apo) B- 100. A lysine-rich sequence within apo B- 100 (residues 3121 - 3217), {{which we have}} termed lysine-rich apo B- 100 -derived (KRAD) - 98 peptide, {{may be responsible for}} its activity. Within this region, residues 3147 - 3160 (KRAD- 14) contain an exceptionally high proportion of positive amino acids. Both recombinant KRAD- 98 and KRAD- 14 peptides inhibited the procoagulant activity of tissue factor by preventing the activation of factor VII. KRAD- 14 also inhibited the prothrombinase components, factors Xa and V. In comparison with the parent protein (apo B- 100), KRAD- 14 peptide displayed a 20 -fold enhancement in the rate of inhibition, whereas KRAD- 98 peptide exhibited a rate closer to that of apo B- 100. Mutational analysis of KRAD- 14 peptide revealed three adjacent amino acids, alteration of which greatly reduced the inhibitory potential of this peptide. A peptide derived from tissue factor (residues 58 - 66) was found to act co-operatively with tissue factor itself, but also augmented the inhibition of tissue-factor activity by apo B- 100.

The toxicologic symptoms of Lachesis mutas occur from the disorganisation of the blood. This in-vitro study aimed to determine the effect of homoeopathically prepared Lachesis mutas 6 CH, 9 CH, 12 CH on the coagulation of blood. Twenty volunteers, fulfilling specified criteria were recruited. Twenty millilitres of blood was drawn from each volunteer. The blood was then centrifuged and the plasma separated into five tubes.

40|$|ASPECTS ON THE CYTOKINE LOAD IN TRAUMA {{with special}} {{reference}} to BLOOD COMPONENTS and LOCAL VERSUS SYSTEMIC CYTOKINE ACTIVITY by Marianne Kristiansson, M. D. Dissertation from the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Huddinge University Hospital Karolinska Institute, Stockholm and Department of Clinical Immunology, Umeå University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden Cytokines and their inhibitors {{are thought to}} be involved in many of the pathophysiological changes associated with trauma and infection. Therapeutic measures such as transfusion of blood components could have a bearing on the systemic cytokine load in these conditions. The relationship between local wound and systemic cytokine activity in humans has not been elucidated. The aims were to investigate the cytokine pattern in infected and not infected patients in the early postoperative period and the local and systcmic responses to trauma as reflected by the cytokine network and coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters and to characterize the content of cytokines in retrieved blood and in stored red blood cell concentrates (RBCs). Material and Methods: Activation of the immune system was assessed by determining the concentrations of ~he following components: tumour necrosis factor a (TNF), interleukin-l B (IL-I), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), soluble TNF receptors I and 11 (sTNF-R 1, sTNF-R 11), IL- I receptor antagonist (IL- I ra), a soluble form of the IL- 6 receptor (slL- 6 -R). soluble E-Selectin (sE-Selectin), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-l (slCAM 1), and soluble vascular adhesion molecule- I (sVCAM-I). <b>Haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were assessed by determining thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrin, soluble, antithrombin, fibrin D-dimer, prothrombin fragment l+ 2, protein C and protein S. Tbe systemic proinflammatory cytokines were studied in 20 patients subjected to moderate or major surgery, 9 with infections and 11 without. The local and systemic immune/haemostatic responses were studied in 10 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. The charactersistics of blood retrieved from a local tMuma site were investigated in 10 patients undergoing arthroplasty (hip or knee). Twenty-two units of stored RBCs were examined during the storage period. The effects of leukocyte filtration on the content of cytokines and soluble TNF receptors in RBCs were studied. Results: Patients with infections had higher IL- 6 concentrations than those without. Interindividual variations of the plasma IL- 6 concentrations were great in both groups. Wound drainage blood from a local trauma site hl patients undergoing arthroplasty displayed a more marked activation of the immune system, - in particular the anti-inflammatory components -, and of the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> than did the systemic circulation. In retrieved blood, intended for autotransfusion, marked hypercoagulability and increased concentrations of IL- 6 were found. In stored RBCs, the concentrations of IL- I and IL- 8 increased during the storage period. IL- 2 was never detected. The concentrations of cytokines and solublc TNF receptors were higher in non-filtered than in prestorage filtered units of RBCs. Filtration {{at the end of the}} storage period did not affect the concentrations of cytohnes and soluble TNF receptors. Conclusions: The present data suggest that monitoring of the systemic concentrations of components of the cytokine network does not accurately reflect the local immune response. The amount of retrieved blood retransfused to patients ought to be considered. Stored RBCs contained cytokines, but we remain about the clinical implications of this finding. Prestorage leukocyte filtration reduced the occurrence of cytokines and soluble TNF receptors in RBCs which may suggest that the handling of blood components should be modified accordingly.

The participation of many biologically active substances(including among others: kinins, endothelins, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, prostanoids and platelet factors) in breakdown and regenerative processes within functional layers of the endometrium has been described. The regulative role of steroid hormones (estrogens, progesterone, activin-follistatin) was taken into consideration.

40|$|PLATELET FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CARCINOMA: A) PREOPERATIVELY, B) DURING ANAESTHESIA AND C) 30 MINUTES AND THREE HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION. THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE APPLIED: 1. PLATELET COUNT. 2. BLEEDING TIME (MIELKE ET AL 1969). 3. PLATELET ADHESIVENESS TEST (SALZMAN'S METHOD, MODIFIED). 4. PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP, COLLAGEN AND ADRENALINE. 5. "ADP RELEASE" FROM PLATELETS BY COLLAGEN. IT WAS FOUND THAT: A) DURING THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD THE PLATELET ADHESIVENESS, PLATELED AGGREGATION AND ADP-RELEASE WERE SLIGHTLY REDUCED. B) AT 30 MINUTES AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION THE PLATELET AGGREGATION SHOWED A FURTHER SLIGHTREDUCTION AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS SLIGHTLY PROLONGED. C) THREE HOURS AFTERTHE BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION THE PLETELET AGGREGATION WAS FURTHER REDUCED AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS FURTHER PROLONGED. THE PROLONGATION OF THE BLEEDING TIME THE REDUCTION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE DELAY PERIOD OF THE COLLAGEN-INDUCED AGGREGATION AT 3 HOURS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION COMPARED TO THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, IN NO ONE CASE THE RESULTS WERE ABNORMALLY LOW. THESE CHANGES OF PLATELET FUNCTION CANNOT CAUSE DISTURBANCES OF THE <b>HAEMOSTATIC</b> <b>MECHANISM.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether an impairment of the haemostasis could be observed experimentally when thromboprophylactic substances, which act differently on the <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanism,</b> were given single or in combination in prophylactic doses. In 36 rabbits we measured the primary haemostatic plug formation time (PHT), rebleedings and total haemostatic plug formation time (THT) after transection of venules and arterioles using an intravital microscope. We combined unfractionated heparin (UH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in low dose with either dextran 70 or polygeline (placebo volume expander) in a randomized double-dummy set up. In the placebo group (NaCl and polygeline) the median PHT was 55 and 101 seconds for arterioles and venules respectively, which are well-comparable to earlier results from our group. Most prolonged PHT and THT for arterioles were seen for dextran+NaCl, actually less prolongation was seen for UH+dextran. We did not observe any differences, except for a prolongation of THT for venules in rabbits given dextran+NaCl (p less than 0. 05). Thus, in thromboprophylactic doses used, there does not seem to be an impaired or additive effect between heparins and dextran 70 in primary haemostasis in rabbits...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Trimeresurus stejnejeri venom {{plasminogen}} activator (TSV-PA) is a {{snake venom}} serine proteinase that specifically activates plasminogen. Snake venom serine proteinases form a subfamily of trypsin-like proteinases that are characterised {{by a high}} substrate specificity and resistance to inhibition. Many of these venom enzymes specifically interfere with <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and display a long circulating half-life. For these reasons several of them have commercial applications and are potentially attractive pharmacological tools. Results: The crystal structure of TSV-PA has been determined to 2. 5 å resolution and refined to an R factor of 17. 8 (R free, 24. 4). The enzyme, showing the overall polypeptide fold of trypsin-like serine proteinases, displays unique structural elements such {{as the presence of}} a phenylalanine at position 193, a C-terminal tail clamped via a disulphide bridge to the 99 -loop, and a structurally conserved Asp 97 residue. The presence of a cis proline at position 218 is in agreement with evolutionary relationships to glandular kallikrein. Conclusions: We postulate that Phe 193 accounts for the high substrate specificity of TSV-PA and renders it incapable of forming a stable complex with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and other extended substrates and inhibitors. Mutational studies previously showed that Asp 97 is crucial for the plasminogenolytic activity of TSV-PA, here we identify the conservation of Asp 97 in both types of mammalian plasminogen activator – tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA). It seems likely that Asp 97 of tPA and uPA will have a similar role in plasminogen recognition. The C-terminal extension of TSV-PA is conserved among snake venom serine proteinases, although its function is unknown. The three-dimensional structure presented here is the first of a snake venom serine proteinase and provides an excellent template for modelling other homologous family members...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) defines atherosclerotic {{disease of}} the arteries to the legs. PAD begins early in life and remains asymptomatic over long periods. The ankle brachial index (ABI) is an important diagnostic test which can identify asymptomatic individuals {{and serve as a}} good marker of the underlying peripheral and systemic atherosclerosis. Recent advances in vascular biology proposed a role of inflammatory and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in atherosclerotic disease. Although inflammatory and haemostatic markers have been associated with coronary atherosclerosis in large scale epidemiological studies their role in PAD development is not well established and for many markers unknown. Also, their relationship with the progression of early asymptomatic disease has not been studied before. The aim of this thesis was to examine 12 markers of inflammation and haemostasis in relation to peripheral atherosclerotic progression and incident PAD. The Edinburgh Artery Study was used for this analysis. This is a population based cohort study of 1, 592 men and women recruited in 1987. ABI was measured at baseline and at two follow up examinations which were conducted after 5 and after 12 years. Also, subjects were followed up for cardiovascular events for 17 years. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), E-selectin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), vonWillebrand factor (vWF), factor VII, fibrinopeptide A (FpA) and prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) were measured at baseline. Valid ABI measurements were available for 1, 582 subjects at baseline, for 1, 081 subjects at the 5 year follow up and for 816 subjects at the 12 year follow up. The population showed a progression in atherosclerotic disease assessed by the mean ABI decline over time. The mean change in ABI was - 0. 04 (0. 18) after 5 years and - 0. 06 (0. 19) after 12 years. From inflammatory markers, CRP (p < 0. 01), IL- 6 (p < 0. 001) and ICAM- 1 (p < 0. 01) were associated with atherosclerotic progression after 12 years, independently of baseline ABI and of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Also, from haemostatic markers, fibrinogen (p = 0. 05) and D-dimer (p ≤ 0. 05) were significantly associated with atherosclerotic progression independently of baseline ABI and cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, subjects with higher levels of both D-dimer and IL- 6 at baseline had the greatest ABI decline. Also, IL- 6 showed the stronger independent effect on atherosclerotic progression and retained statistical significance after adjustments for all inflammatory markers and for fibrinogen and D-dimer. Approximately 26...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{coagulation}} activation {{with reduced}} antithrombin III (ATIII) activity {{was seen in}} healthy neonates. Although systemic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-like plasminogen activator (u-PA) levels showed no significant differences from normal adults, enhanced fibrinolysis was indicated by elevated D-dimer and low plasminogen levels in the neonates in this study. Enhanced fibrinolysis observed was countered by elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI- 1) levels, a trend similar to that observed in the amniotic fluid during labour. The elevated PAI- 1 level seen in neonates may have a beneficial effect in preventing haemorrhage in the neonatal period. The <b>haemostatic</b> and fibrinolytic <b>mechanisms</b> studied in normal pregnancy neonates were similar to neonates born to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mothers. Further studies need to include neonates with poor outcome and low Apgar score to assess their haemostatic status...|$|R
