50|$|Hospital {{acquired}} infections by {{this species}} have been reported. The {{reason for this is}} due to the ability of A. candidus to reside in a wide range of environments, from showerheads to storage tanks and potted plants. The fungus can be observed microscopically in infected tissued mounted in potassium or sodium hydroxide solution containing the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener,</b> calcofluor white, or in fungal-specific tissue stains such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain. Aspergillus candidus secretes cytotoxic metabolites like terphenyl compounds and terprenins, as well as citrinin and immunotoxic (1→3)-β-D-glucans. In addition to humans, there have also been reports of A. candidus disease in pigs and birds.|$|E
30|$|The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agents (FBAs) {{could be}} {{primarily}} applied to paper {{to enhance their}} whiteness and brightness characteristics, because it increases the ultraviolet-blocking properties by absorbing light in the near ultraviolet region and re-emitting at a longer wavelength in the blue and visible regions [4 – 7]. As an important class of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agents, 4, 4 ′-diamino-stilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (DSD), which includes great conjugated system containing double carbon bonds, is widely used for whitening paper [8 – 10]. However, there still exist some deficiencies. DSD-based FBAs on paper tended to have a poor light fastness resulting from the trans–cis photoisomerization during the irradiation, and, consequently, had negative effects on the visual quality and value of paper. In addition, the solutions of the DSD-based FBAs in water have no adhesive property and film-forming property. Therefore, the practical applications of them are limited. To overcome the shortcomings mentioned above, the synthesis of a high-performance <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agent has become an intriguing topic. Zhang et al. prepared many kinds of triazine–stilbene <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agents which include different substitutes in the triazine rings [11 – 16]. Konstantinova et al. prepared polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agent based on the DSD acid-triazine structure [17 – 19]. Grabachev and Konstantinova et al. prepared polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> by fixing DSD acid-triazine monomer on the long chain of styrene or acrylonitrile [20 – 23]. However, the triazine–stilbene <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agent and the synthetic polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agent had poor water solubility and single function, which also restrict the practical applications of them. Therefore, the synthesis of water-soluble, multifunctional and polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener</b> agent remains a great challenge.|$|E

30|$|With {{the limit}} of forest {{resources}} all over the world, high-yield pulp (HYP), containing attractive features, such as high bulk, high opacity, high stiffness, good printability et al., has been gaining increasing interests in the manufacturing of uncoated and coated fine paper and paperboards. However, {{the main drawback of}} HYP is the color reversion, since it contains much more lignin [1 – 4]. The special chemical structure of lignin is easily influenced by a certain external environment, for instance, temperature, light, and the presence of metal cations. Among them, the light is the main factor. When the long term exposed under the sunshine, the structure of lignin can easily generate chromophores or auxochromes, losing the brightness of paper to make it yellowing. It leads to the weakness of light stability, especially the brightness stability of HYP, which greatly hindered its application in some high-value paper. According to the research about the light-induced yellowing mechanism of HYP, different proposed yellowing inhibition methods were studied, such as chemical modification of lignin, exploring a new bleaching process of high-yield pulp and adding chemical auxiliaries. From the perspective of cost and effect of light stability, adding chemical auxiliaries (ultraviolet absorbents, radical scavenger, and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brighteners,</b> et al.) is considered as the most feasible method to exhibit the yellowing of HYP.|$|R

40|$|The {{roles of}} the cell wall and {{cytoskeleton}} in cell differentiation of Metarhizium anisopliae were examined by treating germlings with antagonists of wall formation or with drugs which bind to microtubules and filamentous actin. Evidence for the greater plasticity of the appressorial wall compared with nongrowing regions comes from differential staining with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brighteners</b> (Uvitex and Calcofluor) and fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin; agents which detect chitin. Sorbose, which interferes with primary wall formation, was a potent inhibitor of differentiation which indicates that formation of appressoria involves addition of materials to the wall which matches the wall extension. Treatment with the anti-microfilament agent, cytochalasin A, disrupted polar growth and produced “ballooning” of the hyphal tip, indicating that actin stabilizes the tip against turgor pressure and {{may be involved in}} the transition to nonpolar growth of appressoria. Flooding differentiated germlings with 0. 5 % acetic acid produced bursting of appressoria and extrusion of the cytoplasm, indicating that growing appressoria are also turgescent and that internal hydrostatic pressure is a component in their growth. The effects of anti-microtubule agents are consistent with the well-known role for microtubules in the transport of vesicles. Taken together, our studies indicate that the microtubule-microfilament network is involved in the mediation of extracellular signals but not in initial reception. Inhibition of differentiation by vanadate (an inhibitor of the plasma membrane ATPase) and gadilonium (a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels) implies that changes in membrane potential {{may play a role in}} signal reception. We propose a model for the sequence of events during differentiation in which an induction signal, perhaps involving a localized change in transmembrane potential produced by deformation of the plastic hyphal tip, disrupts the apical Ca 2 + gradient required for maintenance of polar growth and the actin cytoskeleton, the consequent differential redistribution of Ca 2 + in the cell enlargement zone initiates germ tube swelling and appressorium formation by turgor pressure against an expanded area of the cell wall produced by disruption of exocytosis at the original apex and randomly dispersed intussusception of new wall material over the entire cell surface.

We report here the occurrence of fungi in deep-sea sediments from ~ 5000 m depth in the Central Indian Basin (9 - 16 oS and 73 - 76 oE). A total of 181 cultures of fungi, most of which belong to terrestrial sporulating species, were isolated by a variety of isolation techniques. Species of Aspergillus and non-sporulating fungi were the most common. Several yeasts were also isolated. Maximum species diversity was observed in 0 - 2 cm sections of the sediment cores. Direct staining of the sediments with Calcofluor, a <b>fluorescent</b> optical <b>brightener,</b> revealed the presence of fungal hyphae in the sediments. Immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies raised against a deep-sea isolate of Aspergillus terreus (# A 4634) confirmed its presence in the form of hyphae in the sub-section from which it was isolated. A total of 25 representative species of fungi produced substantial biomass at 200 bar pressure at 30 o as well as at 5 oC. Many fungi showed abnormal morphology at 200 bar/ 5 oC. A comparison of terrestrial isolates with several deep-sea isolates indicated that the former could grow at 200 bar pressure when growth was initiated with mycelial inocula. However, spores of a deep-sea isolate Aspergillus terreus (# A 4634), but not the terrestrial ones, showed germination at 200 bar pressure and 30 oC.

To identify novel therapeutic options for the treatment of skin infections, we compared the sensitivity of representative strains of the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans to CFW and a panel of fluorescent brighteners and phytoalexin compounds. We identified the structurally related stilbene fluorescent brighteners 71, 85, 113 and 134 as fungicidal to both T. rubrum and C. albicans to a similar degree as CFW, and the stilbene phytoalexins pinosylvan monomethyl ether and pterostilbene inhibited to a lesser degree, allowing us to develop a structure-activity relationship for fungal inhibition. Given the abilities of CFW to absorb UV 365 nm and bind specifically to fungal cell walls, we tested whether CFW combined with UV 365 nm irradiation would be synergistic to fungi and provide a novel photodynamic treatment option. However, while both treatments individually were cytocidal, UV 365 nm irradiation reduced sensitivity to CFW, which we attribute to CFW photoinactivation. We also tested combination treatments of CFW with other fungal inhibitors and identified synergistic interactions between CFW and some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors in C. albicans. Therefore, our studies identify novel fungal inhibitors and drug interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the tapetal cell surface and associated structures in Avena has been followed from cell formation to senescence. Plasmodesmata initially connect the tapetal cells to each other, the pollen mother cells, and the inner loculus wall cells. These connexions are subsequently severed, those to the sporogenous cells being broken first at the pollen mother cell surface during callose wall formation. Loss of cellulose from the tapetal walls was followed using {{the decline in the}} ability of the wall to bind the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightener,</b> Calcofluor White M 2 R New. Subplasma-membrane microtubules persist after loss of the cellulose wall. The tapetal plasma membrane facing the meiocytes then develops a series of depressions, or cups, over its surface, which are later the site of pro-orbicule formation. Sporopollenin is laid down over the pro-orbicules, to form orbicules, and over other tapetal cell surfaces. No morpho-logical evidence was found for the intracytoplasmic formation of pro-orbicules or polymerized sporopollenin precursors. These observations on Avena are compared with those on other plants. The changes in the cell wall and associated structures, plasmodesmata and microtubules, are considered in detail, while the general significance of cell wall loss to the water relations of the tissue are assessed. Proposals that pro-orbicule formation results from non-specific accumulation of lipid at a free cell surface are rejected, instead this formation is considered {{to be related to the}} presence of a specially modified plasmamembrane surface...|$|E
40|$|Dye {{perfusion}} {{is commonly}} used for the identification of conductive elements important {{for the study of}} xylem development as well as precise hydraulic estimations. The tiny size of inflorescence stems, the small amount of vessels in close arrangement, and high hydraulic resistivity delimit the use of the method for quantification of the water conductivity of Arabidopsis thaliana, one of the recently most extensively used plant models. Here, we present an extensive adjustment to the method in order to reliably identify individual functional (conductive) vessels. Segments of inflorescence stems were sealed in silicone tubes to prevent damage and perfused with a dye solution. Our results showed that dyes often used for staining functional xylem elements (safranin, fuchsine, toluidine blue) failed with Arabidopsis. In contrast, <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Brightener</b> 28 dye solution perfused through segments stained secondary cell walls of functional vessels, which were clearly distinguishable in native cross sections. When compared to identification based on the degree of development of secondary cell walls, identification with the help of dye perfusion revealed a significantly lower number of functional vessels and values of theoretical hydraulic conductivity. We found that lignified but not yet functional vessels form {{a substantial portion of the}} xylem in apical and basal segments of Arabidopsis and, thus, significantly affect the analyzed functional parameters of xylem. The presented methodology enables reliable identification of individual functional vessels, allowing thus estimations of hydraulic conductivities to be improved, size distributions and vessel diameters to be refined, and data variability generally to be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. (Energy Systems) {{manages a}} closed {{hazardous}} waste disposal unit, Chestnut Ridge Security Pits (CRSP), {{in the form}} of two trenches and several auger-holes, located on top of the eastern portion of Chestnut Ridge at the Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant in Tennessee. The groundwater monitoring system for the unit presently consists of a network of upgradient and downgradient monitor wells. To investigate the discharge of groundwater to springs and streams, Energy Systems, through Geraghty and Miller, Inc., conducted an initial dye-tracer study during the driest part of 1990. The dye was detected at some of the monitoring sites, but verification was necessary due to the proximity of some sites to extraneous dye sources. Based on the results of the initial study, Energy Systems recommended to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) in the 1990 Groundwater Quality Assessment Report (GWQAR) (HSW 1991) for the CRSP that a second dye-tracer study be conducted during the wet weather season. The procedures and materials were reviewed, and a field inspection of the monitoring sites was performed in the fall of 1991. The actual test commenced {{during the first week of}} February 1992 with a 4 -week baseline monitoring period to determine the inherent variability of the emission spectra within the wavelength range characteristic of Rhodamine WT (RWT) and <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Brightener</b> 28 (FB 28) or similar naturally occuring compounds within in the aquifer. This is commonly referred as background in discussion of minimum detectable levels of dyes. On March 13, RWT and FB 28 were injected; weekly monitoring began with the collection of the first set of detectors on March 19. The test was originally scheduled to conclude after 12 weeks but was extended to 18 weeks when no definitive results were obtained...|$|E
