5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers <b>device</b> <b>of</b> the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E
5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the <b>device</b> <b>of</b> a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, he argues that citizens {{do not have the}} right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Casino Royale, Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story. Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights) posthumously. Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the Cold War. The plot of From Russia, with Love uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had {{its roots in the}} wartime German Enigma machine. The novel's plot <b>device</b> <b>of</b> spies on the Orient Express was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{were very}} close, {{in matters of}} {{business}} and personally. Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and, with his brother, adopted the ancient heraldic <b>device</b> <b>of</b> the earls of Warwick, the bear and ragged staff. Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special significance for him. The town of Warwick felt this during a magnificent visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate {{the feast of the}} Order of Saint Michael, with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566. He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester's Hospital, a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today.|$|E

5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange <b>device</b> <b>of</b> his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a piece of his brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a <b>device</b> <b>of</b> which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite <b>device</b> <b>of</b> Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E

The next section is focused on the most modern <b>devices</b> <b>of</b> didactic technique, mainly on the interactive board. There is also mentioned the project Vzdělání 21, which is engaged to integrate the modern <b>devices</b> <b>of</b> didactic technique into elementary schools. The practical part is focused on the didactic technique at the economic high schools in Prague. Using a questionnaire I find out how schools are equipped, what <b>devices</b> <b>of</b> didactic technique teachers use. Then, I analyze how often teachers utilize them and in which part of lesson. Teachers answer also questions like considering different points of view, which technique is the most effective one. Training courses are also touched as a form of educating teachers in the field of didactic technique...|$|R
5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché <b>device</b> <b>of</b> {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|Short story {{fiction and}} tales were also popular during the Tang, {{one of the}} more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779–831), which was widely {{circulated}} in his own time and by the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional <b>device</b> <b>of</b> romantic tension.|$|E
5|$|The chief <b>device</b> <b>of</b> ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E

5|$|The {{literary}} critic G. Koster writes that, when writing Siti Akbari, Lie Kim Hok was {{limited by the}} formulaic Pandji romances and syair poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between Siti Akbari and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the archetype of a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into a chaotic kingdom, one which Koster suggests {{is representative of the}} cycle of oral law. Such an archetype and formulas were used in contemporary works such as Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina (Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China). The plot <b>device</b> <b>of</b> a woman passing herself as a man to do war was likewise common in Malay and Javanese literature. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and native literary influences.|$|E
5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational <b>device</b> <b>of</b> replacing the staves in silent measures with whites space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accession}} of ElizabethI in November 1558, Robert Dudley {{came into}} great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received {{the post of}} Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, {{so that he could}} not be held accountable for his predecessor's embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley.
