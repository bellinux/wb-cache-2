5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>take</b> advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>take</b> away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E

We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work.

500|$|Quesada {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that the Netflix series {{would be set}} within the MCU.

It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E
500|$|In an NPR {{interview}} via affiliate WBUR-FM, Mumbai Mirror columnist Aseem Chhabra called Chak De! India [...] "an {{example of}} a film that's been made {{within the framework of}} Bollywood and yet it is a very different film. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>take</b> up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance. Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film. Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India. People loved it". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film four out of five stars stating that it was a film of [...] "great performances by a bunch of unknowns." [...] India Today called Chak De! India [...] "the most feisty girl power movie to have come out of Bollywood ever." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu wrote, [...] "At another level, Chak De is about women's liberation. It {{is one of the best}} feminist films of our times." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Chak De's ... a winner all the way." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called the film [...] "the most authentic, meticulously researched sports movie India has made". [...] In Kolkata's Telegraph, Bharathi S. Pradhan wrote that the film combines [...] "an extremely well-knit screenplay with unrelentingly deft direction, 16 unknown, and not even glamorous, girls simply carried you with them, with one single known actor compelling you to watch Chak De India without blinking". Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave Chak De! India four out of five stars stating that [...] "while the tale of the sporting underdog is hardly new, Jaideep Sahni's screenplay offers a rare look at a popular Indian sport often overshadowed by cricket." [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the film gave a fresh look to the conventional underdog sports film, comparing its premise to the U.S. victory in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Derek Elley of Variety called Chak De! India [...] "a patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals."

2500|$|An Æon Flux Hollywood adaptation, {{which was}} {{released}} in the United States on December 2, 2005, provoked controversy among Æon Flux fans over initial reports that the film adaptation seemed to bear {{little resemblance to the}} original full-length animated series or the Liquid Television shorts, as no one involved with the original television series had a role in the making of the film. While <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>take</b> a number of major liberties with the character and concept of the series (such as making the character of Una into Æon's sister and giving Trevor a previously-unmentioned brother who plays a major role), the film also [...] incorporates characters, themes, gadgets, and even specific scenes as featured in the TV version, most notably a reenactment of the TV show's most iconic image: Æon trapping a fly in her eyelashes.

In August 2014, D'Onofrio stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out".

2500|$|The {{game was}} given {{generally}} favorable reviews, receiving around an 82.68% on GameRankings.

But {{keep in mind that the}} game doesn't stray far from the formula, and the game's difficulty will put off those who never mastered Parappa. So, to put it another way, if you didn't play Parappa to death and love every minute of it, you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy." [...] Similarly, IGN gave it an 8.6 and commented on the gameplay, story, graphics and sound, stating, [...] "If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. ... But the rest of the game is sweet. ... Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos... has so much more that Parappa didn't have." [...] Game Revolution also gave it a B, calling it [...] "a cool game, if for no other reason than to entertain sufficiently inebriated party guests. It's easily the most insane mish-mash of psychadelia [...] yet seen on a console, and at least deserves a shot (or the whole bottle, even)", but criticized the story, calling it [...] "the most obtuse, disjointed, drug-induced mess of a story that has ever been conceived, period."
