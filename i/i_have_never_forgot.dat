6000|$|Of {{the details}} of the {{struggle}} we know very little. Burke was not fond in after life of talking about his earlier days, not because he had any false shame about the straits and hard shifts of youthful neediness, but because he was endowed with a certain inborn stateliness of nature, which made him unwilling to waste thoughts on the less dignified parts of life. This is no unqualified virtue, and Burke might have escaped some wearisome frets and embarrassments in his existence, if he had been capable of letting the detail of the day lie more heavily upon him. So far as it goes, however, it is a sign of mental health that a man should be able to cast behind him the barren memories of bygone squalor. We may be sure that whatever were the external ordeals of his apprenticeship in the slippery craft of the literary adventurer, Burke never failed in keeping for his constant companions generous ambitions and high thoughts. He appears to have frequented the debating clubs in Fleet Street and the Piazza of Covent Garden, and he showed the common taste of his time for the theatre. He was much of a wanderer, partly from the natural desire of restless youth to see the world, and partly because his health was weak. In after life {{he was a man of}} great strength, capable not only of bearing the strain of prolonged application to books and papers in the solitude of his library, but of bearing it at the same time with the distracting combination of active business among men. At the date of which we are speaking, he used to seek a milder air at Bristol, or in Monmouthshire, or Wiltshire. He passed the summer in retired country villages, reading and writing with desultory industry, in company with William Burke, a namesake but perhaps no kinsman. It would be interesting to know the plan and scope of his studies. We are practically reduced to conjecture. In a letter of counsel to his son in after years, he gave him a weighty piece of advice, which, is pretty plainly the key to the reality and fruitfulness of his own knowledge. [...] "Reading," [...] he said, [...] "and much reading, is good. But the power of diversifying the matter infinitely in your own mind, and of applying it to every occasion that arises, is far better; so don't suppress the vivida vis." [...] We have no more of Burke's doings than obscure and tantalising glimpses, tantalising, because he was then at the age when character usually either fritters itself away, or grows strong on the inward sustenance of solid and resolute aspirations. Writing from Battersea to his old comrade, Shackleton, in 1757, he begins with an apology for a long silence which seems to have continued from months to years. [...] "I have broken all rules; I have neglected all decorums; everything except that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgot</b> a friend, whose good head and heart have made me esteem and love him. What appearance there may have been of neglect, arises from my manner of life; chequered with various designs; sometimes in London, sometimes in remote parts of the country; sometimes in France, and shortly, please God, to be in America." ...|$|E

"I cannot think," [...] said Estella, {{raising her}} eyes after a silence [...] "why {{you should be}} so {{unreasonable}} when I come to see you after a separation. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> your wrongs and their causes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been unfaithful to you or your schooling. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> shown any weakness that I can charge myself with." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a 1981 column, Ellison {{wrote that}} he {{stumbled}} across one particular episode in his childhood, and afterwards, became a devoted Quiet, Please listener.

6000|$|... "You {{poor little}} darling!" [...] she said, {{as she came}} up and took Mrs. Ferrola in her arms. [...] "You must let me come, and not mind me; for I know all about it.

6000|$|... "I {{was only}} five {{when my mother}} died," [...] she sobbed.

6000|$|LORD LOAM. And now, my friends, I {{should like}} to think that there is some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying over which you might ponder in my absence.

I {{want to see}} the sea break {{against your}} rocks," [...] she went on, as she took the cigarette which he passed her. [...] "There used to be a little path through your plantation to a place where you look sheer down.

6000|$|... 'So soon, my chela? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> it. But when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left thee {{it seemed}} better that I {{should go to}} the Temple and take counsel, for, look you, India is very large, {{and it may be that}} wise men before us, some two or three, have left a record of the place of our River. There is debate in the Temple of the Tirthankars on this matter; some saying one thing, and some another. They are courteous folk.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> the old days.

Then {{he put his arm}} round her and kissed her, as he might have done to a sister,--as it was natural that he should do to Marie Bromar, {{regarding}} her as a cousin. She did not speak a word more, and then he was gone! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ran to the}} Hall—I {{dared not}} go to the Kennels. In a short time I was back with the squire and three men. As I led the way, I saw the child lifting a corner of the {{handkerchief}} to peep and see if the eyes were closed in sleep. Then he heard us, and started violently. When we removed the covering, and he saw the face unchanged in its horror, he looked at me with a look <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?

I, as a humble Lama, was engaged in preparing her apartment when she entered and threw aside her veil; yes, and perceiving a young man, spoke to me, asking many questions, and even if I was not glad to look again upon a woman." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{started from}} my side, and ran along a jagged timber which {{protruded}} {{from the place}} we stood upon, and overhung the deep water at some height, without the least defence. The incident is so impressed on my remembrance, that if I were a draughtsman I could draw its form here, I dare say, accurately as it was that day, and little Em'ly springing forward to her destruction (as it appeared to me), with a look that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten,</b> directed far out to sea.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> helped him, read {{letters to}} him, and written them for him, and {{overlooked}} his accounts {{enough for the}} work not to be altogether new and strange to me, and I took it up eagerly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> the sermon by the holy Father Vincent, whom the Church has since acknowledged as a saint, and our excellent Abbe had heightened the impression that a good work lay prepared for me; but he warned me to be prudent, and I am afraid I was hot-headed and eager.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{was better}} off," [...] she continued, [...] "I {{used to help}} at a soup kitchen in Poplar. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> a certain look we used to see {{occasionally}} {{in the faces of}} some of the men and women. I found out what it meant--it was hunger. Once or twice lately <b>I</b> <b>have</b> passed the girl who has just gone out, upon the stairs, and she almost frightened me. She had just the same look in her eyes. I noticed it yesterday--it was just before dinner, too--but she never came down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brocas {{gazed at}} me intently, {{brushing}} {{back with his}} hand the thick hair on my forehead and remarked, “He has a fine head!

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Philip, [...] "so it does; {{but it does}} me good. It's a heavy sorrow {{to think}} of that time, but it does me good, George.

William, my boy, your mother loved him dearly to the last, and with her latest breath said, 'Tell him I forgave him, blessed him, and prayed for him.'

6000|$|No! Whatever the {{preliminary}} anxieties {{might have been}} this adventure was not to end in sorrow.

[...] However he took care to mention that there were various kinds of audacity. Oh, there are, there are!... There is, for instance, the kind of audacity almost indistinguishable from impudence....

But I resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards; {{and turning to}} Mehevi, I soon made the ready chief understand that I wished a light to be brought.
