50|$|The Wilkinson ADC was {{designed}} by D. H. Wilkinson in 1950. The Wilkinson ADC {{is based on the}} comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until its voltage is equal to the amplitude of the input pulse (a comparator determines when this condition has been reached). Then, the capacitor is allowed to discharge linearly, which produces a ramp voltage. At the point when the capacitor begins to discharge, a gate pulse is initiated. The gate pulse remains on until the capacitor is completely discharged. Thus the duration of the gate pulse is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse. This gate pulse operates a linear gate which receives pulses from a <b>high-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> clock. While the gate is open, a discrete number of clock pulses pass through the linear gate and are counted by the address register. The time the linear gate is open is proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse, thus the number of clock pulses recorded in the address register is proportional also. Alternatively, the charging of the capacitor could be monitored, rather than the discharge.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the exploration of the charge transport through nanoscale low-dimensional systems [1, 2].

The tunneling current usually depends on the transition in low-dimensional structures or in the interface between the metal electrodes and nanoscale structures [11]. Particularly, the NDR behavior in transport properties of the nanojunction strongly depends on the quantum nature of the nanowire and the metal contacts [12].

40|$|This work is {{comprised}} of two key accomplishments: the study and design of fluidic oscillators for flow control applications, and the development and application of porous pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) for unsteady flowfields. PSP development was a necessary prerequisite for characterizing the unsteady fluid dynamics of the fluidic oscillators. Development work on the fluidic oscillator commences with {{a study on the}} internal fluid dynamics of the feedback-free class of oscillators. This study demonstrates that the collision of two jets within a mixing chamber forms an oscillating shear layer driven by counter-rotating vortices. A micro-scale version of this type of oscillator is also characterized with PSP measurements and frequency surveys. Subsequently, this <b>high-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (∼ 5 kHz) is coupled with a low-frequency solenoid valve to create dual-frequency injection that is useful in flow control applications. A new hybrid actuator is developed that merges piezoelectric and fluidic technology. This piezo-fluidic oscillator successfully decouples the oscillation frequency from the supply pressure, thereby enabling closed-loop flow control actuation. Fluidic oscillators are then applied to a practical flow control application for cavity tone suppression. The fluidic oscillators are able to suppress the tone by 17. 0 dB, while steady blowing at the same mass flow rate offers only 1. 6 -dB suppression. Work with pressure-sensitive paint involved development of a model for the quenching kinetics of the paint. Two fast-responding paint formulations, Polymer/ceramic and Fast FIB, are evaluated experimentally and compared to the model predictions. Both the model and experiments demonstrate that a paint layer will respond faster to a decrease in pressure than an increase of the same magnitude, and that the polymer/ceramic paint has a flat frequency response of at least 1. 59 kHz. Furthermore, the excellent response characteristics of porous PSP are highlighted by applying the paint to various flowfields. The polymer/ceramic formulation is used to record the 12 -kHz oscillating shock wave and propagating acoustic waves generated by a Hartmann oscillator. Polymer/ceramic PSP is also used to measure the acoustic mode shapes in a rectangular resonance cavity driven by a speaker at 145 dB. These results compare favorably to the analytical solution for the same geometry. ...|$|E
40|$|Back in 2000, the Nobel prize {{committee}} {{recognized the}} invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 by Jack Kilby {{as one of the most}} far-reaching steps forward in modern technology. Today, almost sixty years after this invention, electronics are found everywhere in our society. This is mainly caused by the characteristic exponential growth factors in electronics industry (Moore's law), which result in an exponential miniaturization and cost decrease. This evolution goes hand in hand with a similar growth of wireless communication technology: devices become smaller, frequencies and data rates higher. As a result, the wearability and functionality of wireless electronic devices drastically increase. This ongoing technological progress is the direct cause of the appearance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). An increasing number of autonomously operating devices is wirelessly connected to a network and/or to the internet; an evolution which will eventually result in the so-called Internet of Things. Since both the miniaturization as well as the cost decrease of these wireless sensor nodes is necessary to become economically feasible, a growing need for fully-integrated, single-chip wireless devices is observed. The use of modern deep-submicron CMOS technologies in analog electronics, however, has several drawbacks in terms of temperature sensitivity and linearity. This work elaborately investigates the possible circuit techniques to overcome the temperature- and supply voltage-sensitivity of fully-integrated time references for ultra-low-power wireless communication in WSN. In a first step, the basic needs to build a frequency reference are studied. Furthermore, a closer look to the short-term as well as the long-term frequency stability of integrated oscillators is taken. This results in a design strategy, which is applied to six different oscillator design cases. All six implementations are subject to a study of phase noise and long-term frequency stability. The first two implementations are respectively a temperature- and a supply voltage-independent Wien bridge oscillator. The temperature independence is obtained by using a novel feedback amplifier topology of which the output resistance only depends on a temperature stable resistor. This requires advanced circuit techniques and a highly-stable amplitude regulation circuit. The second Wien bridge implementation makes use of two nested regulators, resulting in an ultra-high supply voltage stability over a wide voltage range. The third design case makes use of a high-quality bondwire LC tank. A novel pulsed driving technique is developed to decrease the power consumption of the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit. This driving technique reduces the impact of the oscillator circuitry on the output frequency and therefore also on the temperature- and supply voltage-stability of the oscillator. To better understand the application field of the pulsed oscillator topology, the noise performance is analyzed as well. The processed implementation is a unique combination of power consumption and long-term frequency stability. Next, two injection-locked oscillator implementations are discussed. Apart from a stable output frequency, also a high absolute accuracy is obtained due to the locking to a wirelessly received RF signal. The first design uses the received 2. 4 GHz carrier frequency as a time reference. Despite its simple system topology, this approach has several drawbacks in terms of selectivity and power consumption. The second implementation locks to the envelope of the received RF signal. Therefore, the oscillator can run at a low frequency, drastically diminishing the power consumption. A second improvement is the addition of a network coordination receiver. For this purpose, a novel ultra-low-power receiver topology and demodulation technique are developed. As a result of the addressability, the overall power consumption in the network is reduced. The last design case is a temperature- and supply voltage-independent oscillator-based sensor interface. Since the challenge in this design is rather the stability of the output value than the frequency stability, a different design strategy is used. It is shown that the matching of different oscillator delay stages can be applied to obtain a stable and highly-linear digitalization of a sensor input. The wirelessly injection-locked oscillator, the coordination receiver, the sensor interface and a transmitter are combined into one highly-flexible wireless tag. The content, the scrambling code and the length of the transmitted data burst can be adapted freely, depending on the application. The developed tag can therefore be used in a wide range of applications, with different accuracy requirements and energy constraints. Finally, an elaborate comparison between the developed oscillator designs and the state of the art is performed. It is shown that the free-running implementations as well as the injection-locked designs improve the state of the art. This discussion results in several suggestions for possible future work. nrpages: 466 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Vibrational {{overtone}} excitation of jet-cooled methanol, {{in combination}} with infrared laser assisted photofragment spectroscopy (IRLAPS) detection, reveals OH stretch bands that are significantly simplified with respect to room-temperature spectra. The simplification afforded by jet-cooling permits the observation of spectral splitting {{on the order of}} 50 cm(- 1) in the region of the 5 nu(1) OH stretch overtone band. Tracking this splitting as a function of OH stretch vibrational level {{in combination with}} isotopic substitution studies allows us to identify the perturbing state as the combination level involving four quanta of OH stretch and one quantum of CH asymmetric stretch, 4 nu(1) + nu(2). Careful examination of the spectra reveals that this strong interaction arises from a fourth-order anharmonic term in the Hamiltonian that couples the OH and CH ends of the molecule. These frequency domain results indicate that subsequent to coherent excitation of the 5 nu(1) band, methanol would undergo energy redistribution to the methyl part of the molecule on a time scale of similar to 130 fs.
