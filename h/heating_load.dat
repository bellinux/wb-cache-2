The cryogenic system shall operate smoothly to extract the pulsed <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> by circulating supercritical helium into the coils and structures. However {{the value of the}} total <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> and its temporal variation are not known before the plasma scenario starts. A real-time <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> estimator is of interest for the process control of the cryogenic system in order to anticipate the arrival of pulsed <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> to the refrigerator and finally to optimize the operation of the cryogenic system. The large variation of the thermal loads affects the physical parameters of the supercritical helium loop (pressure, temperature, mass flow) so those signals can be used for calculating instantaneously the loads deposited into the loop. The methodology and algorithm are addressed in the article for estimating the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> deposition before it reaches the refrigerator. The CEA patented process control has been implemented in a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and has been successfully validated on the HELIOS test facility at CEA Grenoble. This <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> estimator is complementary to pulsed load smoothing strategies providing an estimation of the optimized refrigeration power. It can also effectively improve the process control during the transient between different operating modes by adjusting the refrigeration power to the need.

The uncertainty of an estimate of the total <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> arises mainly from the <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> of the LHe transfer lines. We aligned the accumulated static <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from the engineering specifications of each LHe supply line provided by vendors with the measured value of a cryogenic transfer system as built. A tolerance factor is introduced in our alignment effort to take into consideration all construction uncertainties of the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> and is also an effective merit of figure to verify the applicability of our calculational approach. Tolerance factor 1.5 is adopted as the safety margin of <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> of a LHe supply line to determine the total mass flow rate demanded in the test of a SRF module in the design phase, as is commonly used in cryogenic designs. After the transfer system is installed, the value of the actual tolerance factor can be verified on aligning the modeled accumulated static <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> with the results measured in situ. Additionally, after the actual accumulated static <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from the LHe supply line is obtained, the actual total <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> at varied heater power applied on the tested SRF module will be deduced. In this paper, we take the 220 -m flexible cryogenic transfer lines as built at NSRRC as an example to introduce how to design long cryogenic transfer lines for a cryogenic test stand. This transfer system is originally designed with tolerance factor 1.5; the actual tolerance factor is found to be 1.287 by experiment after the system installation. The feasibility and validity of our simple analytical approach with actual tolerance factor 1.287 are verified using five test cases with varied operating conditions.|$|R
