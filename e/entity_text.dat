40|$|We {{report on}} our {{experiments}} for the CLEF 2013 Entity Recogni-tion Challenge. Our approach {{is based on}} a combination of machine translation and NE tagging techniques. The Silver Standard Corpus (SSC) is used to obtain a corresponding annotated corpus in the target language. The plain text of the SSC is translated and a mapping is created between entities in the original and phrases in the translation, to which are associated the same CUIs as in the origi-nal. This produces a Bronze Standard Corpus (BSC) in the target language. A dictionary of entities is also created, which associates to each pair (<b>entity</b> <b>text,</b> semantic group) the corresponding CUIs that appeared in the SSC. The BSC is used to train a model for a Named Entity tagger. The model is used for tagging entities in sentences in the target language with the proper semantic group and the entity dictionary is used for associating CUIs to each of them...|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} literature {{is a rich}} and challenging data source for research in systems biology, providing numerous interactions between biological <b>entities.</b> <b>Text</b> mining techniques have been increasingly useful to extract such information from the literature in an automatic way, but up to now {{the main focus of}} text mining in the systems biology field has been restricted mostly to the discovery of protein-protein interactions. Here, we take this approach one step further, and use machine learning techniques combined with text mining to extract a much wider variety of interactions between biological entities. Each particular interaction type gives rise to a separate network, represented as a graph, all of which can be subsequently combined to yield a so-called integrated network representation. This provides a much broader view on the biological system as a whole, which can then be used in further investigations to analyse specific properties of the networ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a graph-based model called TremenRank to collec-tively identify target <b>entities</b> in short <b>texts</b> given a name list only. TremenRank prop-agates trust within the graph, allowing for an arbitrary number of target <b>entities</b> and <b>texts</b> using inverted index technology. Fur-thermore, we design a multi-layer direct-ed graph to assign different trust levels to short texts for better performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art meth-ods with an average gain of 24. 8 % in accu-racy and 15. 2 % in the F 1 -measure on three datasets in different domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Maps and cartographic {{sketches}} as representational media carry {{information in}} two ways: pictorially and {{by means of}} symbols. Maps and sketches are pictorial representations as they result from an analogical mapping of spatial characteristics into a spatial (planar) medium. This means that maps, and in certain aspects sketches too, form a natural or physical homomorphism {{in the sense of}} knowledge representation theory [PALMER 1978]. On the other hand, in every map and in every sketch certain classes of entities are represented symbolically. This means that signs are used which stand for geographic <b>entities</b> (<b>text</b> is also regarded as symbolic representation denoting names of depicted entities). As maps and sketches are pictorial as well as symbolical representations, they can be seen as multimodal communication systems. From this point of view it is worthwhile to look at the differences between maps and sketches for the following reasons:. In comparing the two media it is...|$|R

The goal of text-mining is analyzed large collections of unstructured documents {{for the purposes of}} extracting interesting and non-trivial patterns of knowledge.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which scientific equipment is opened up, redesigned, reinvented and reassembled to make it more usable for amateur scientists. I call this process “amaterialization”. Scientific equipment is amaterialized to produce other versions of equipment or, to be more precise, to produce a similar functionality with another kind of equipment. The amaterialization of equipment is, in fact, a many-fold process. We see equipment being redistributed across social worlds, being technically transformed and redesigned, and alongside material artefacts, we see a proliferation and an increasing circulation of non-material <b>entities</b> (<b>texts,</b> information, videos, etc.). This equipment can act as a material link between, on the one hand, the actual experimentation in laboratories and, on the other, more general arguments about the “democratisation” and “opening up” of biology. Hence, their value does not only derive from the fact that they can serve as boundary objects between amateurs and professionals. Their value also stems from their evocative power, a power that arises from a convergence between material practices and moral visions, between the redesign of scientific objects and the articulation of political objectives...|$|R
