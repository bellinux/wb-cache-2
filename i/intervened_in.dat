Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, since that time, {{the armed forces}} have not <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country. In reality, the larger problem has been the misuse and sometimes abuse {{of the military and}} police by political and ethnic leaders.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{problem to}} face the empire came {{as a result of}} the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) in Persian politics when he <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and Anatolia until Heraclius' successful counterattack. In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories.|$|E

5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008. That was accomplished with the help of Ross Perot, who had met him at a history seminar in 2001, and who <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> 2008 with the White House regarding a final resting place.|$|E
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> August 1943.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son, Bogdan III the One-Eyed (15041517) whose reign {{was troubled by}} {{a long series of}} {{military}} conflicts with Poland and Wallachia. The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (15171527). His successor, Peter IV Rareş (15271538, 15411546) <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the struggle for the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Székely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I's partisans.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the credibility of this report has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1941, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning. The German Wehrmacht also <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> Greece thus beginning the Battle of Greece. Italian failures had allowed another British foothold on the continent too close to the Romanian oilfields — Germany's ally.|$|E
5|$|The first castle at Lydford {{was built}} in the {{aftermath}} of the Norman conquest of England in 1066. In 1068 William the Conqueror <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> South-West England to put down widespread Anglo-Saxon revolts against Norman rule and set about pacifying the region. William had been responsible for building urban castles across England in the former centres of Anglo-Saxon power and in Devon he constructed new urban castles at Exeter, Totnes, possibly Barnstaple and in the town of Lydford.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British and French <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions {{and a desire}} to return to France. The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E
5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
40|$|Although {{teachers}} {{may be in}} a position to address enactments of sexual and gender stigma among their students, little is known about their motivations to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> such situations. We surveyed secondary school teachers in the Netherlands, assessing how beliefs, norms, and self-efficacy were related to their intentions to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> two hypothetical situations that involved bullying of lesbian/gay or gender non-conforming students. We found significantly stronger intentions to intervene among teachers who were more confident in their abilities to intervene successfully and who had stronger beliefs that <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> the situation would produce a positive outcome...|$|R
50|$|That {{people would}} also be obliged to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> nature {{has been used as}} a reductio ad absurdum against the {{position}} that animals have rights. This is because, if animals such as prey animals did have rights, people would be obliged to <b>intervene</b> <b>in</b> nature to protect them, but this is claimed to be absurd. An objection to this argument is that people do not see <b>intervening</b> <b>in</b> the natural world to save other people from predation as absurd and so this could be seen to involve treating non-human animals differently in this situation without justification.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the ship}} {{participated in the}} Siege of Tsingtao in August–November 1914 and served as the {{flagship}} of the Japanese Intervention Squadron in Vladivostok in 1918 when Japan <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the Russian Civil War. She {{was used as a}} training ship in 1921 and disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Sources differ as to her ultimate fate; she was either sunk as a target by aircraft near Miura in July 1924 or scrapped at Kobe in 1924–1925.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations to defense of Crete. The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He <b>intervened</b> <b>in</b> the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669.
