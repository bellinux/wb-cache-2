50|$|In 2013, a new 10,000 krónur {{banknote}} was introduced. The face {{of natural}} scientist and poet Jónas Hallgrímsson {{appears on the}} bill, {{as well as the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover.</b>|$|E
50|$|The new {{forest was}} {{populated}} with animals from refugia in Italy, Spain and the Balkans. Animals such as Emys orbicularis (European pond tortoise), which require warmer temperatures, {{were to be}} found in Denmark. The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> came as far north as Norway.|$|E
50|$|The moor {{contains}} about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies. Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Bodmin Moor, North, {{and has been}} officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB. Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The moor has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of European stonechats {{as well as a}} wintering population of 10,000 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers.</b> The moor has also been recognised as a separate natural region and designated as national character area 153 by Natural England.|$|R
50|$|The many water {{birds and}} other coastal avians, that have their {{hatching}} grounds on Sylt {{or use the}} island for resting on their migrations constitute an ornithological feature. There are two notable hatching areas on Sylt, the Königshafen bay with the small island Uthörn {{in the north and}} the Rantum basin in the southeast. Birds that hatch on Sylt include black-headed gull, Arctic tern, pied avocet, common redshank, common gull, oystercatcher, northern lapwing, common shelduck and tufted duck. During the migration, Sylt is a resting spot for thousands of brent geese and shelducks, Eurasian wigeons and common eiders, as well as bar-tailed godwits, red knots, dunlins and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers.</b> Ringed plover, common snipe, ruff and other species are less common visitors to the island.|$|R
40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plovers Pluvialis spp. {{all have}} very {{distinct}} breeding plumage rich in contrast, with a conspicuous black belly and breast bordered by a bright white fringe. <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> are known partly to replace their breeding plumage with striped yellow feathers during incubation, different from both breeding and non-breeding plumages. In this study a similar partial breeding moult {{was observed in}} Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> caught on the nest or collected during incubation, although the feathers did not differ clearly from those of non-breeders. This moult starts during incubation and precedes the post-breeding moult into non-breeding plumage. Because the lighter feathers reduce {{the contrast between the}} black belly and the white flanks, we suggest that during incubation the plumage characteristic that {{plays an important role in}} mate choice is no longer important; at this stage it is better for the bird to be inconspicuous. Additional information on museum skins of <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and of Grey Plovers indicated that only the three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> undergo this partial moult, but that Grey Plovers in general retain full breeding plumage throughout incubation. The three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> also resemble each other in their generally very passive nest defence strategies. In contrast, the larger Grey Plovers actively chase and attack aerial and ground predators. Thus, a reduced conspicuousness of the body plumage during incubation is likely to benefit the <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> more than the Grey Plover. We suggest that nest defence behaviour, plumage characteristics and perhaps size have co-evolved as a response to different selection pressures in <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plover, but alternative hypotheses are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The area {{supports}} breeding {{populations of}} several important birds: merlin, short-eared owl and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> {{are listed in}} Annex 1 of the European Commission's Birds Directive as requiring special protection, while black grouse, red grouse, dunlin, Northern lapwing, ring ouzel and twite {{are listed in the}} United Kingdom's Red Data Book (Birds).|$|E
50|$|Broadhaven Bay and its inlets support {{important}} {{numbers of}} breeding terns of several varieties and black-headed gulls. It {{is an important}} area for wintering waterfowl. The following species have nationally important populations in the area - red-breasted merganser, ringed plover, grey plover, sanderling, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit, brent goose, oystercatcher, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> lapwing, knot, curlew, common redshank and turnstone.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{principal}} importance {{lies in its}} nationally important breeding {{populations of}} birds: three species - merlin, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> and short-eared owl - are listed in Annex 1 of the European Commission's Birds Directive as requiring special protection and several others, including red grouse, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and dunlin, {{are listed in the}} United Kingdom's Red Data Book (Birds).|$|E

40|$|Before {{predictable}} {{periods of}} high nutritional demand and {{little or no}} intake, vertebrates store fuel mainly composed of energy-dense lipids or energy-poor but protein-rich muscle tissue. Documenting contrasts in fuel composition and storage patterns within species, or even within individuals, would greatly help to elucidate the functional significance {{of the variety of}} storage strategies demonstrated in birds. We show here that the 40 – 50 g mass gain of 200 g in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> (Pluvialis apricaria) in autumn in The Netherlands consists of fat only, but that the similar gain in body mass in spring consists of proteinaceous tissue (pectoral and other skeletal muscle and possibly skin tissue). That the same <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> store energy in autumn and store protein in spring suggests that they face energy deficits in early winter and risk protein deficits in spring, especially perhaps after arrival on the breeding grounds in late April and early May. In autumn and winter their diet consists largely of protein-rich earthworms, but upon arrival on Low Arctic and montane tundras, <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> tend to eat berries which are rich in sugars but notably poor in proteins. We therefore propose that the build-up of proteinaceous tissue in spring reflects a strategic storage of a nutritional resource that is likely to be in short supply somewhat later in the year. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Eurasian</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis apricaria staging in the Netherlands {{during the}} non-breeding season show strikingly {{constant}} seasonal changes in body mass with a first mass peak in late November and December {{and a second}} peak in late April and May. Despite huge sample sizes, variations in this pattern over successive years in the 1990 s and among age classes were minuscule. However, {{in contrast to the}} body mass levels at other times of the year, there was a marked decline in the winter peak mass of <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from the 1970 s/early 1980 s to 1989 – 2000. The decrease, by an average of 29 g, was about half the extra mass previously stored in autumn. This additional mass is known to consist of fat and may be interpreted as an energy store − insurance − for sudden cold spells when a negative energy balance forces the birds to move south and stay in front of the frostline. As the rate of the mass increase in September–October showed no change from the 1980 s to the 1990 s, changes in food availability are unlikely to explain the long-term mass decline. Also, there were no differences in two factors known to influence energy expenditure and feeding rate, air temperature and rainfall. The one striking environmental change relevant to plovers was the steep increase in the occurrence of raptors in the northern Netherlands in the 1980 s, notably Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus and Goshawks Accipter gentilis. We argue that the halving of the winter mass peak over a decade is consistent with the hypothesis that under increased risk of predation, birds lower their body mass in order to reduce individual vulnerability, a reduction that may be traded off against an increased risk of starvation. ...|$|R
50|$|The area {{supports}} breeding {{populations of}} a number of species of birds that are listed in the United Kingdom's Red Data Book (Birds), including three - merlin, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> and short-eared owl - that are listed in Annex 1 of the European Commission's Birds Directive as requiring special protection. The flora of the area includes a number of species that are scarce locally or nationally.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} the near-threatened {{great snipe}} (Gallinago media) and {{vulnerable}} long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis).Other resident or breeding birds include the black grouse, western capercaillie, greater scaup, red-throated loon, Arctic loon, common kestrel, merlin, northern harrier, rough-legged hawk, common crane, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> Eurasian dotterel, whimbrel, spotted redshank, common redshank, wood sandpiper, Temminck's stint, purple sandpiper, broad-billed sandpiper, ruff, red-necked phalarope and long-tailed jaeger.|$|E
50|$|The European {{golden plover}} (Pluvialis apricaria), {{also known as}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> or just the golden plover within Europe, is a largish plover. This species is similar to two other golden plovers. American golden plover, Pluvialis dominica, and Pacific golden plover, Pluvialis fulva, are both smaller, slimmer and {{relatively}} longer-legged than European golden plover, and both have grey rather than white axillary feathers (only properly visible in flight).|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{the purpose}} of the {{traditional}} wilsternetting technique of the northern Netherlands for trapping <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis apricaria has changed from a hunting practice to bird ringing. In a companion paper, the ringing data and recoveries for demographic trends from 1949 onwards were examined. This paper examines the possibility of using the same data source for future monitoring of the population. Schemes monitoring the vital rates (survival rate, recapture probability, and recruitment) of migrant birds are rare. For two reasons, it is not immediately clear that effective monitoring is possible. First, hunting returns from outside The Netherlands have ceased so the data available for analysis are much reduced. Secondly, the very low probability of recapturing a ringed bird (c. 0. 25 %) leads to large standard errors of estimates of demographic parameters. For practical reasons, only triennial monitoring was considered for survival and recapture rates. Program MARK was used to estimate vital rates. A Monte Carlo simulation showed that a change in survival rate of 5 % or more should be detected within six years if more than 3000 birds were ringed per annum. The proposed monitoring methodology was applied to the historical data, using only the data available {{at the end of each}} three-year period. This test detected the changes in survival rate and recapture probability. Reasonable consistency with earlier recruitment estimates was achieved despite the need to monitor this aspect on an annual basis. The parallel monitoring of recruitment through the juvenile proportion of catches is regarded as desirable, both to validate the methodology and for mutual checking between methods. ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} birds are found at the fjord and the inner {{wetlands}} but the nature preservation has a special focus on the whooper swan. It is a migratory bird which eats underwater vegetation and forages on wintergreen meadows. During mild winters the whooper swan stays in the area from April to November and the flocks here has been recorded to reach some 12,000 birds. The number of swans wintering in the area has risen over the years, possibly {{as a result of}} milder winters or maybe an enlarged area suitable for foraging. In and around the fjord the most common {{species of birds}} are eurasian coot, northern lapwing, <b>eurasian</b> wigeon, mallard, <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> tufted duck, <b>eurasian</b> teal, mute swan, a number of waders and, during cold winters, the common merganser. White-tailed eagle and peregrine falcons also have a presence in the area, both very rare and endangered birds in Denmark. The dominant species at Norsminde Fjord are dabbling ducks, a result of the large number of surface algae caused by previous years nutrient pollution from poor wastewater management and fertilizer runoff.|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> across Scotland was modelled using land cover and management variables, {{and used to}} highlight the spatial association between <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> abundance and current and proposed wind farm developments. Overlap was greatest in three biogeographical zones (the Western Isles, the Western Central Belt and the Borders Hills) and was estimated at ca. 5 % of the biogeographical population in each case. New field data were used to predict the effects of wind farm development on <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations, employing a conservative analytical approach to detect statistically significant wind farm related effects. The results provide evidence of significant avoidance of wind turbines by breeding <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> to a distance of at least 200 metres. Furthermore, wind farm sites appear to support lower densities of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> than predicted by the distribution model for sites without wind farms. Therefore, there is evidence for negative effects of wind farm developments on <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> and we suggest strategies to reduce any potential conflict between the need to promote wind energy {{and the need to}} maintain <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations...|$|R
