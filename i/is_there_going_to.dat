That great process of history, of thousands of years of an increase in a dignity of the individual, seems to have been halted for a good period of time by the growth of totalitarian societies, and those are breaking up now. Certainly the totalitarian instinct has not gone away. There are a great many wars going on and struggles by peoples, but that ice jam, that blockage that was representative of the domination of a third of the world by communism, is gone. I think that’s reason for great optimism.|$|E

40|$|The term „neuroenhancement“ {{refers to}} the {{improvement}} of cerebral, particularly cognitive functions of healthy individuals via pharmacological or invasive interventions. The aim of this dissertation is {{to point out the}} development of invasive neuroenhancement, to discuss it by means of medical ethics and to come to a closing evaluation. For that purpose several invasive neurotechnologies are presented initially, namely deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, visual and auditory prosthesis and brain-computer interfaces. Today these technologies are used in a therapeutic context, but they bear a potential for being used for the purpose of neuroenhancement. In the following it is shown how invasive neuroenhancement could be realised in the future and to which cerebral functions it could be applied. Afterwards, the ethical discussion of invasive neuroenhancement techniques is carried out. First, the definition of enhancement and the distinction between therapy and enhancement is analysed; it is made clear that although these terms and definitions contain a certain notional vagueness they are useful as a conceptual and terminological basis for the discussion. Subsequent, the arguments around pharmacological neuroenhancement are divided into three large groups – health aspects, impacts on society and alteration of the idea of man – and it is analysed whether or to what extend these arguments can be applied to invasive neuroenhancement as well. In doing so, it can be shown that the health risks in nonpharmacological neuroenhancement can be much more severe because of the invasiveness, the irreversibility and the difficulty of anticipating the possible outcome especially regarding the arguable benefit. It is shown that the impacts of invasive neuroenhancement on society are going to be dependent on the following questions: First of all, are these procedures going to be financed publicly or privately and secondly, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be any compensational regulation by the governments? If invasive neuroenhancement was financed publicly, it would be possible that social tendencies like coercion, hyper-competitiveness and medicalization could be established similar to the tendencies that are seen today in pharmacological neuroenhancement. But because of the high costs of these procedures {{it is more likely that}} they are going to be financed privately. If there wasn’t any compensational regulation, this could lead to a new kind of two-class society and to an amplification of existing socio-economic differences and inequalities, national as well as international. Concerning the discussion about a possible alteration of the idea of man, one can see that arguing against invasive neuroenhancement by pointing to the „naturalness“ of certain aspects of personality or to certain inalterable core values is not convincing. On the other hand, it would be also short-sighted to legitimise invasive neuroenhancement just by pointing to the right to create one’s own identity by any means. Especially the possibility of a change in personal identity through influencing certain cerebral areas associated with memory functions by invasive neuroenhancement interventions appears to be such a severe complication that a cautious approach is to be asked for. Besides, the experiences in the therapeutic application of invasive neurotechnologies show that mechanistic conceptions, such as the idea of selectively manipulating one specific aspect of personality, do not live up to reality; they also show that severe adverse effects, especially unintended changes of personality traits, can occur. In particular the unintended manipulation of certain cerebral functions that contribute to self-evaluation and self-assessment needs to be viewed critically. To sum it up, it is necessary to state that invasive neuroenhancement techniques must be evaluated critically because of their severe health risks and the imponderability of their outcome. To specify these risks, it will be essential to observe the development of invasive neurotechnologies used in the therapeutic context as well as for the purposes of neuroenhancement, and, if necessary, to re-evaluate the benefit-to-risk profile. Future decisions whether to approve certain forms of invasive neuroenhancement cannot be based on the individual health-associated benefit-risk-profile solely. The possible social consequences and developments, in terms of the alteration of certain established and crucial values within society, have to be taken into consideration as well. Such a challenge places a responsibility on neurosciences, ethics, politics and society itself in terms of making a decision – in the context of an ideally public and parcipatory process – about the prospective direction the development of invasive neurotechnologies and invasive neuroenhancement in particular should take...|$|E
40|$|Cue: While {{livestock}} farmers {{should make}} every effort to stop their animals becoming sick, some illness is inevitable. In such cases, the only cure may be a drug that the farmer will have to buy. Sometimes however, the veterinary drugs that are available for sale may do more harm than good. In Nigeria for example, many of the drugs that are sold are fake, or else are too old and are no longer effective. Such drugs cost farmers large amounts of money, but do nothing for their livestock. To address this problem, the Nigerian government recently authorised the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control, known as NAFDAC, to regulate those who sell veterinary drugs, something which has not been done in the past. Tunde Fatunde spoke to Dr Jerry Abenga, a senior veterinary research officer from Kaduna State, about the problems of controlling the supply of veterinary drugs in the country, and the progress made by NAFDAC. He began by asking Dr Abenga to explain the problem of unregulated veterinary drugs in Nigeria. IN:		?Because there is no regulation? OUT:		?so that these drugs are identified. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Jerry Abenga emphasising the need for collaboration in the battle against fake veterinary drugs in Nigeria. Transcript Abenga	Because there is no regulation on who sells veterinary drugs, {{there has been a lot}} of importation of drugs that have been found to be fake. Fatunde	For example? Abenga	There are several antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines, that many of them don?t have the necessary chemicals to cure diseases. And also a lot of drugs meant for the control of ecto-parasites, many of them have no effect on animals. Fatunde	What do you mean by ?ecto-parasites?? Abenga	Ticks, flies and other parasites that infest the body of animals. Fatunde	Now these drugs are they adulterated or are they expired or is it that they are not adapted to the specific species of animals we have in Nigeria? Abenga	Many of the drugs because they are not properly regulated, many of them are expired, some because of the keeping quality. We are in a tropical environment and some of these drugs are exposed to the heat of the sun and as a result there is degeneration. And these drugs, many of them they don?t have effect to cure disease anymore. Fatunde	What are the peculiar problems being faced by farmers when they buy these drugs and the animals that have been affected? Abenga	Some of these drugs are toxic, some cause decay at the point of injection, some even cause abortion. Also these drugs because they don?t cure, the animal dies of infection. So you find out that the farmer spends so much money buying the drug and the animal still dies. So he lost his money in buying of drugs and his animals also die. Fatunde	How do they know that these drugs are adulterated? What are the processes? Abenga	When a vet buys a drug and treats an animal and the animal does not improve then it?s a clear sign that the drug is probably not containing the necessary chemicals to cure the infection. And when that is established, further confirmation is done in the laboratory. And there are some companies doing chemical analysis of these drugs. And because of this some drugs have been found not to contain, sometimes even nothing that could cure disease. Fatunde	How is the government tackling these problems? Abenga	For many years this area has been neglected by the government. But looking at the affect of animal disease on our economy, the federal government through the agency of NAFDAC, that is National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control, they have now stepped in to look at the shelves of shop owners that sell veterinary drugs, who want to look for their license and to analyse these drugs, to make sure that even veterinary drugs come under their control. Fatunde	What is your own assessment so far on the work being done by NAFDAC? Abenga	Well NAFDAC has just stepped in to control veterinary drugs and we are still waiting to see the impact of their activity. As of now fake veterinary drugs are still being sold in several parts of the country. Fatunde	<b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a collaborative work between NAFDAC, farmers and veterinary institutes in Nigeria with a view to tackling this problem? Abenga	Yes NAFDAC cannot succeed in the war against fake veterinary drugs alone. There needs to be collaboration with the other research institutes like Nigerian Veterinary Research Institute and several universities who have faculties of veterinary medicine so that these drugs are identified. End of track. A senior veterinary research officer describes the need for regulation in the sales of veterinary drugs, to prevent sales of fake, out-or-date or adulterated drugs, and a recent initiative being undertaken in Nigeria to achieve this...|$|E
