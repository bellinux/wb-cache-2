40|$|AbstractEach {{dry powder}} inhaler has a {{different}} resistance so that a respirable dose can be generated from the formulation by the patient's inspiratory effort. It {{is important to recognize}} that this effect is achievable. The inspiratory flow characteristics of asthmatics inhaling through a Clickhaler®were determined. In a separate study 10 volunteers inhaled separate 2 × 100 μ g salbutamol doses from a Clickhaler (ML Laboratories plc U. K.). Two different formulations (one with a high and one with a low respirable fraction) were each inhaled using an inspiratory flow of 30 and 60 l min− 1. A urine sample was collected 30 min post inhalation and then pooled for the next 24 h. The mean (SD) inhalation rate of 24 asthmatics when they inhaled from a Clickhaler was 37 · 3 (14 · 6) l min− 1. The mean (SD) urinary salbutamol excretion during the first 30 min, by the volunteers, using the high respirable <b>dose</b> <b>formulation</b> at 30 and 60 l min− 1 was 5 · 59 (1 · 87) and 4 · 62 (1 · 49) μ g respectively (P< 0 · 01). Similar values using the low respirable <b>dose</b> <b>formulation</b> were 4 · 84 (1 · 58) and 3 · 86 (2 · 14) μ g. There was no significant difference between the amounts excreted in the 24 h post-dose. The different 30 -min urinary excretions following inhalation of the two formulations suggest a link between the relative bioavailability of salbutamol to the lung and the respirable dose, and that a slow inhalation rate should be used when using a Clickhaler. The patient study shows that this rate is achieved by most asthmatics without further training...|$|E
40|$|Context: Anticholinergic {{drugs are}} {{commonly}} used in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) who do not achieve symptom relief {{and quality of life}} improvement with conservative management. Several drugs, with different <b>doses,</b> <b>formulations,</b> and routes of administration are currently available, making the choice quite difficult. Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of different <b>doses,</b> <b>formulations,</b> and route of administration of the available anticholinergic drugs. Evidence acquisition: A systematic review of the literature was performed in August 2007 using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Efficacy (micturitions per 24 h, volume voided per micturition, urgency urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h, incontinence episodes per 24 h) and safety (mainly, adverse events and withdrawal rates) end points were evaluated in the randomized control trials (RCTs) assessing the role of anticholinergic drugs in non-neurogenic OAB. Meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted using the Review Manager software 4. 2 (Cochrane Collaboration). Evidence synthesis: Our systematic search identified 50 RCTs and three pooled analyses. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) had a more favorable profile of adverse events than oxybutynin IR. Regarding different dosages of IR <b>formulations,</b> <b>dose</b> escalation might yield some limited improvements in the efficacy but at the cost of significant increase in the rate of adverse events. In the comparisons between IR and extended-release (ER) formulations, the latter showed some advantages, both in terms of efficacy and safety. With regard to the route of administration, use if a transdermal route of administration does not provide significant advantage over an oral one. Conclusion: Many of the available RCTs have good methodological quality. ER formulations should be preferred to the IR ones. With regard to IR <b>formulations,</b> <b>dose</b> escalation might yield some improvements in the efficacy with significant increase in the AE. More clinical studies are needed to indicate which of the drugs should be used as first-, second-, or third-line treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nonclinical safety {{studies are}} {{required}} to follow applicable Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Nonclinical dose formulations {{are required to}} be analyzed to confirm the analyte concentration, homogeneity, and stability. Analytical samples that fall outside of the acceptance criteria are considered out of specification (OOS), and an investigation should be conducted. The US FDA has issued a guidance document for GMP studies on conducting OOS investigations. However, no regulatory guidance has been issued regarding nonclinical safety study (GLP) OOS investigations, which often vary in regard to content, assessment, and impact statements. There is opportunity {{to improve the quality}} of OOS investigations by defining expectations and providing guidance in several areas including root cause assessment, impact statements, and acceptable paths forward. This paper will provide recommendations of best practices for nonclinical <b>dose</b> <b>formulation</b> OOS investigations.

40|$|Vaccination {{remains the}} {{principal}} {{way to control}} seasonal infections and {{is the most effective}} method of reducing influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Since the 1940 s, the main method of producing influenza vaccines has been an egg-based production process. However, {{in the event of a}} pandemic, this method has a significant limitation, as the time lag from strain isolation to final <b>dose</b> <b>formulation</b> and validation is six months. Indeed, production in eggs is a relatively slow process and production yields are both unpredictable and highly variable from strain to strain. In particular, if the next influenza pandemic were to arise from an avian influenza virus, and thus reduce the egg-laying hen population, there would be a shortage of embryonated eggs available for vaccine manufacturing. Although the production of egg-derived vaccines will continue, new technological developments have generated a cell-culture-based influenza vaccine and other more recent platforms, such as synthetic influenza vaccines...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Thiomersal (also {{known as}} thimerosal in the United States) is a {{bacteriostatic}} preservative used in vaccines and other biologic products since the 1930 s for several specific reasons: as a broad bacteriostatic agent; as a preservative; and to inactivate specific moieties. Its concentration in most vaccines results in delivery of about 25 μg of thiomerosal in each dose administered. Importantly, thiomerosal is only 50 % ethylmercury by weight. Many regulators, including the United States Code of Federal Regulations, require {{the addition of}} a preservative to multi-dose vaccine vials. Multi-dose vials have several advantages. They are cheaper than single <b>dose</b> <b>formulations,</b> and because more doses can be stored in a smaller space, they allow for decreased storage costs across the cold chain from production to final administration.

However, there are limitations to administrate IND as it, {{such as its}} renal toxicity and the high grade of metabolism and degradation. We aimed to encapsulate IND in biodegradable Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (Np) and to engineer their surface by the conjugation with an anti-Cryptosporidium IgG polyclonal antibody (Ab). Methods: Tetramethylrhodamine labelled Np were loaded with IND and modified by conjugation with an Ab. The IND loaded modified Np (Ab-TMR-IND-Np) did not show any change, as shown by chemical analysis studies. Results: The treatment with 50 µM of the Ab-TMR-IND-Np added to the culture {{at the same time}} with excysted oocysts, resulted in a complete inhibition of the infection.

Many researches have been published dealing with the design of multiple ligands, able to act {{at the same time}} towards several targets relevant for a given pathology. In the present review, the clinical results about these compounds have been reported, together with the design strategy adopted, in order to allow a critical evaluation of the outcomes of these efforts. What is emerging is that several effective design strategies of multitarget compounds are available, and the choice among these appears to be dependent on the therapeutic area considered. However, at present, besides multitarget drugs discovered during optimization efforts by means of phenotypic assays, drug coadministrations or fixed <b>dose</b> <b>formulations</b> appear to be more useful therapeutic options than designed multiple ligands; this scenario will change when systems biology will be able to select critical targets, i. e. nodal proteins that should be inhibited in order to obtain a therapeutic action; at this point, the design of multiple ligands will allow a renaissance of medicinal chemistry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to produce fine {{particles}} with different corrugated degree of surface by spray-drying and to investigate the effect of surface morphology on in vitro aerosol performance of the particles within HFA 134 a based metered <b>dose</b> <b>formulations.</b> Compositions of rizatriptan and scutellarin were spray-dried using different spray-drying parameters, and particles were suspended within HFA 134 a. The surface morphology were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the aerodynamic performance of MDIs was evaluated using a next generation pharmaceutical impactor. The surface morphology of spray-dried particles could vary from smooth to moderately corrugated, and to raisin-like depending upon spray-drying parameters and preparation compositions. In general, increasing inlet temperature, decreasing feed concentration and/or adding leucine to the feed solution tended to increase the corrugated degree of particle surface. Deposition results indicated that raisin-like particle based MDIs for all compositions of the two drugs produced significantly better aerodynamic performance in terms of fine particle fractions and mass median aerodynamic diameters relative to the formulations of the corresponding smooth or slightly corrugated particles when the particle compositions were the same. The present results demonstrated that wrinkled particles increased fine particle fractions within surfactant-free MDI formulations...|$|R
