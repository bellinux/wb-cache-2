5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) synthetic fuel and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards with the synthetic fuel powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend.|$|E

5|$|From late 2001, Hercules began {{flying into}} Afghanistan {{to support the}} SAS {{squadron}} deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No.36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As {{the first phase of the}} war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{would use}} approximately 350 gliders for the operation, {{the majority of}} which would transport 6th Airlanding Brigade. This number included thirty-four Hamilcars; four would land in landing zone 'N' between 03:00 and 04:30 {{in support of the}} operations of 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, and would carry four 17-pounder anti-tank guns and their transport vehicles and crews. The other thirty would land at approximately 21:00 in landing-zone 'W' as part of a reinforcement lift. Twenty of the Hamilcars would carry Tetrarch light tanks and their crews which belonged to 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, four more carried three Rota trailers without crews, and another three carried Universal Carriers with their crews. The last three carried two Universal Carriers converted to accommodate a 3-inch mortar, one Universal Carrier which carried a slave battery, sixteen motorcycles and a jeep. The four Hamilcars which were to land in support of 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades took off from Tarrant Rushton at 02:10 on 6 June and were due to land at approximately 03:30; however, only two landed successfully. One suffered a broken tow rope shortly after <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> although it was able to land safely at an airfield in England; the other reached the Normandy coast, but the tow rope was disconnected too early and it landed a considerable distance away from the landing zone. When dawn broke, it was discovered by German forces and attacked; four of the crew and passengers were killed and one captured, but the rest managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, {{and it was then}} flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It was not possible to tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the tow rope was detached; cross-country navigation was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to be inside the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common occurrence. During training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E

25|$|Argentine {{folk music}} is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of {{regional}} dances, a national folk style {{emerged in the}} 1930s. Perón's Argentina would give rise to Nueva Canción, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. Atahualpa Yupanqui, the greatest Argentine folk musician, and Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> in the 1970s, {{and went on to}} influence the entirety of Latin American music. Today, Chango Spasiuk and Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. León Gieco's folk-rock bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.|$|E
