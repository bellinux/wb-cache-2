5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of <b>inattention.</b>|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, <b>inattention</b> and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's <b>inattention</b> to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and <b>inattention</b> resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E
25|$|ROR crashes {{are due to}} <b>inattention,</b> speeding, {{traction}} loss, overreaction, crash avoidance, {{and mechanical}} failure. Rumble strips only prevent ROR crashes due to <b>inattention.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manipulators and abusers {{control their}} victims {{with a range}} of tactics, {{including}} positive reinforcement (such as praise, flattery, ingratiation, love bombing, smiling, gifts, attention), negative reinforcement, intermittent or partial reinforcement, psychological punishment (such as nagging, silent treatment, swearing, threats, intimidation, guilt trips, <b>inattention)</b> and traumatic tactics (such as verbal abuse or explosive anger).|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{hyperthyroidism}} typically {{leads to}} improvement in {{cognitive and behavioral}} impairments. Agitation, <b>inattention,</b> and frontal lobe impairment may improve more rapidly than other cognitive functions. However, several studies confirm that a substantial proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism have psychiatric disorders or mental symptoms and decreased quality of life even after successful treatment of their hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|It appears, in short, that {{contradictory}} cartographic {{evidence in}} this field has been caused either by wartime mistakes, mere <b>inattention</b> or inadvertent proliferation of previous technical mistakes. It does not necessarily reflect consistent legal opinions or policies of either side. The conflicting cartographic evidence may nevertheless {{be one of the}} causes for the different sovereignty claims.|$|E
25|$|More {{common side}} effects may include: Central nervous system depression, {{including}} somnolence, dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, hangover {{feeling in the}} morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and <b>inattention</b> have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported.|$|E
25|$|Her brother {{says the}} report of him {{catching}} her with his girlfriend is completely fabricated and that he never even spoke with the detective who wrote it. Similarly, Lieberman says the couple never fought at the courthouse after her arraignment. The police, they believe, were extrapolating from what little they could find {{in an effort to}} make up for their early <b>inattention</b> to the case.|$|E
25|$|When both {{motor and}} vocal tics are present and persist {{for more than}} one year, a {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome (TS) is likely. TS is an inherited neurobehavioral disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics. Many individuals with TS may also develop obsessions, compulsions, <b>inattention</b> and hyperactivity. TS usually begins in childhood. Up to 5% of the population suffers from tics, but at least 20% of boys will have developed tics {{at some point in their}} lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|Civil <b>inattention</b> {{is defined}} as the polite way to manage {{interaction}} with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon. It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be so crowded that they 'touch' another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect those around them.|$|E
25|$|The AA Highway is a rural two-lane highway {{for most}} of its length and {{traverses}} through some desolate terrain. Driver <b>inattention</b> and speeding, in combination with the numerous side road entrances and at-grade intersections have made it a dangerous and deadly road. To address these issues, guide signs comparable to interstate-styled signs have been installed along the highway at major intersections, along with additional overhead lighting. Other measures to improve safety and increase capacity are under consideration.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1813 Ferret left Leith {{and sailed}} for Portsmouth. The next evening she {{grounded}} and bilged near Newbiggin-by-the-Sea (Northumberland), {{due to the}} <b>inattention</b> and ignorance of her pilot. The pilot, Robert Muckle, was barred from ever serving as a pilot again {{and was sentenced to}} three months in the Marshalsea prison. The court martial reprimanded the Master, Charles Lupton, for failing to keep track of her position and sentenced him to the loss of one year's seniority.|$|E
25|$|The expense was {{borne by}} the community, and strict {{discipline}} was observed. Rav, however, ordered Samuel b. Shilat to deal tenderly with the pupils, to refrain from corporal punishment, or at most to use a shoe-strap in correcting pupils for <b>inattention.</b> A stupid pupil was made monitor until able to grasp the art of learning. Raba fixed the number of pupils at twenty-five for one teacher; if the number was between twenty-five and forty an assistant teacher ("resh dukana") was necessary; and for over forty, two teachers were required.|$|E
25|$|There were 110 class A {{accidents}} in the 25 years that Canada operated the CF-104 resulting in 37 pilot fatalities. Most {{of these were}} {{in the early part}} of the program centering on teething problems. Of the 110 class A accidents 21 were attributed to foreign object damage (14 of which were birds), 14 were in flight engine failures, 6 were faulty maintenance, 9 were mid air collisions. 32 struck the ground flying at low level in poor weather conditions. Of the 37 fatalities 4 were clearly attributable to systems failures, all of the others were attributable to some form of pilot <b>inattention.</b>|$|E
25|$|Side effects {{typical of}} {{hypnotic}} benzodiazepines {{are related to}} CNS depression, and include somnolence, sedation, drunkenness, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (in higher doses), and <b>inattention.</b> Euphoria was rarely reported with its use. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, much more rarely reported than headaches and diarrhea. Anterograde amnesia may also develop, as may respiratory depression in higher doses.|$|E
25|$|The {{lingering}} {{symptoms of}} neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi {{are known as}} Korsakoff's syndrome, or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine, sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi, as characterized by ocular abnormalities, ataxia of gait, a global state of confusion, and neuropathy. The state of confusion associated with Wernicke's may consist of apathy, <b>inattention,</b> spatial disorientation, inability to concentrate, and mental sluggishness or restlessness. Clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance, yet these criteria may be too rigid. Korsakoff's likely represents {{a variation in the}} clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy, as they both share similar pathological origin.|$|E
25|$|Hemispatial neglect, {{also called}} hemiagnosia, hemineglect, {{unilateral}} neglect, spatial neglect, contralateral neglect, unilateral visual <b>inattention,</b> hemi-inattention, neglect syndrome or contralateral hemispatialagnosia, is a neuropsychological condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere {{of the brain}} is sustained, a deficit in attention to and awareness of {{one side of the}} field of vision is observed. It is defined by the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli {{on one side of the}} body or environment, where that inability is not due to a lack of sensation. Hemispatial neglect is very commonly contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but instances of ipsilesional neglect (on the same side as the lesion) have been reported.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} a panel of outside experts determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his Inspiration closed circuit rebreather (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's <b>inattention</b> to his handset and head up displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to Aquarius alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from hypoxia and drowned when the mouthpiece came out of his mouth. Saturation and CCR diving at Aquarius were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures.|$|E
25|$|Can {{there be}} {{anything}} more preposterous than an unknown tongue; {{and in this}} country either for want of books or inability to read, the great part of our congregations must be utterly ignorant of the meaning and sense of the public office of the Church. It may have been prudent, for aught I know, to impose a compliance in this matter with the insulting and reproachful demands of the first reformers; but to continue {{the practice of the}} Latin liturgy in the present state of things must be owing either to chimerical fears of innovation or to indolence and <b>inattention</b> in the first pastors of the national Churches in not joining to solicit or indeed ordain this necessary alteration. It would be nearly 200 years until Carroll's wish for vernacular language-liturgy was realized in the United States {{as a result of the}} Second Vatican Council.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Barry was openly {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} longstanding addictions to cocaine and alcohol; he would later admit that he lost control of his drug habit soon after being sworn in for a third term. His public appearances were marked by his glassy eyes and slurred speech. His aides began scheduling all of his daily events later and later in the day as he was arriving to work as late as lunchtime, and nodding off to sleep at his desk. His ability to function as mayor had become so impaired that even his closest associates urged him not to run again. They tried to create an endowed professorship for him at the University of the District of Columbia. In the wake of Barry's <b>inattention,</b> the city declined badly. Barry was watching Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, California when a winter blizzard struck Washington in January 1987; city crews were accused of badly mishandling the road clearing, adversely affecting local businesses.|$|E
25|$|At the Kai Monastery {{is a young}} initiate, {{given the}} name Silent Wolf. On the feastday of Fehmarn, when all the Kai Lords gather at the monastery, Silent Wolf is sent to cut wood from the {{surrounding}} forest as a punishment for his <b>inattention</b> in class. While he is gone, a surprise attack is launched from the Darklands at several places across Sommerlund. The Monastery is assaulted and the gathered Kai Lords massacred. Rushing back from the woods, Silent Wolf is knocked out by a low-lying tree branch (in the Legends of Lone Wolf novelizations based on the books, it's implied that the branch was placed there by a demi-goddess called Alyss so Silent Wolf would be spared the attack). When he awakes, he finds himself the only survivor. The last of the Kai, he renames himself Lone Wolf and sets out for the capital to inform the King {{of the loss of}} the Kai.|$|E
25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's <b>inattention</b> to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. However, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the valet de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} match, Fleetwood-Smith, O'Reilly, Leo O'Brien and Stan McCabe were summoned {{to appear before}} four of Australia's leading cricket administrators, who read a {{prepared}} statement accusing the team of excessive drinking, <b>inattention</b> to fitness and disloyalty to the captain. The meeting ended in confusion when the four players {{were told that they}} were not being held responsible for the matters raised. This incident {{has been the subject of}} conjecture for many years. It is often interpreted as an illustration of a sectarian divide in Australian cricket during the period. Fleetwood-Smith attended Xavier (a Roman Catholic school) with O'Brien, while McCabe and O'Reilly were raised as Catholics in rural New South Wales; at least two of the administrators present were members of Masonic lodges. Several of the senior players wanted McCabe as captain in place of Bradman, whose relationship with O'Reilly was strained. However, Fleetwood-Smith's presence is puzzling as he missed the first two Tests, to which the administrators specifically referred. Greg Growden, his biographer, records that Fleetwood-Smith had an unlikely friendship with Bradman (in that the two men were of opposite personalities), which later cooled after an unknown disagreement not associated with this incident.|$|E
25|$|Denmark {{also began}} {{a number of}} reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their {{dependence}} on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms {{have led to a}} number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such <b>inattention</b> to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments. Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 2009 Schlesinger's {{task force}} {{released}} its report regarding the overall DoD's {{management of the}} country's nuclear weapons mission. The report criticized the DoD {{for a lack of}} focus and oversight on its nuclear weapons programs and recommended that the DoD create a new assistant secretary position to oversee its nuclear management. The task force found that within the DoD only the United States Navy was effectively managing its nuclear arsenal. The panel stated that it found [...] "a distressing degree of <b>inattention</b> to the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence among many senior DoD military and civilian leaders." ...|$|E
500|$|The federal government's {{intervention}} in the rally attracted strident protests from the [...] "Yes" [...] side, who felt the discounts and coordination were an illegal {{intervention in}} the referendum. Bouchard publicly contrasted the rally with what he believed was the <b>inattention</b> of English Canada {{to the collapse of}} the Meech Lake Accord. Nolin regretted granting permission for the [...] "No" [...] committee once the scale became known, and Johnson felt the rally only exacerbated tensions with regard to English Canada. Opinions on whether the rally had an impact were divided and unable to be gauged, as the rally happened while the final polls for the Monday referendum were being produced.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the flight}} of Mercury-Atlas 7, Kraft had objected to the choice of Scott Carpenter as the {{astronaut}} for the mission, telling Walt Williams that Carpenter's lack of engineering skills might put the mission or his own life in danger. The mission suffered from problems including an unusually high rate of fuel usage, a malfunctioning horizon indicator, a delayed retrofire for re-entry, and a splashdown that was [...] downrange from the target area. Throughout the mission, Kraft found himself frustrated by the vagueness of Carpenter's communications with Mission Control, and what he perceived as Carpenter's <b>inattention</b> to his duties. [...] "Part of the problem," [...] he recalled, [...] "was that Carpenter either didn't understand or was ignoring my instructions." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 33 {{studies on}} gender differences, a small {{significant}} effect (r = [...]06) {{has been found}} indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior. This effect {{may be related to}} the slight gender differences found in delay discounting (i.e., minimizing the value of a delayed reward) and higher levels of impulsivity and <b>inattention</b> in boys. Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age (e.g., puberty) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan. Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does.|$|E
500|$|Hull led the St. Louis Blues with 41 {{goals in}} , but his poor skating and <b>inattention</b> to his {{defensive}} responsibilities concerned the club. Head coach Brian Sutter convinced Hull {{to improve his}} conditioning over the summer. He arrived to begin the [...] {{in much better shape}} and showed a marked improvement in his skating. Center Adam Oates, acquired over the summer, joined Hull on the top line. The pair, dubbed [...] "Hull and Oates" [...] as a play on the band Hall and Oates, were prolific scorers. [...] Hull scored 228 goals between 1989–90 and , the second-highest three-season total of any player in NHL history, behind only Wayne Gretzky's 250 tallies between [...] and [...] He became the fifth player in NHL history to score 50 goals in 50 games in ,—joining Maurice Richard, Mike Bossy, Gretzky, and Mario Lemieux—then repeated the feat in 1991–92.|$|E
500|$|When Albert Victor {{was just}} short of {{seventeen}} months old, his brother, Prince George of Wales, was born on 3 June 1865. Given the closeness in age of the two royal brothers, they were educated together. In 1871, the Queen appointed John Neale Dalton as their tutor. The two princes were given a strict programme of study, which included games and military drills as well as academic subjects. Dalton complained that Albert Victor's mind was [...] "abnormally dormant". Though he learned to speak Danish, progress in other languages and subjects was slow. Sir Henry Ponsonby thought that Albert Victor might have inherited his mother's deafness. Albert Victor never excelled intellectually. Possible physical explanations for Albert Victor's <b>inattention</b> or indolence in class include absence seizures or his premature birth, which {{can be associated with}} learning difficulties, but Lady Geraldine Somerset blamed Albert Victor's poor education on Dalton, whom she considered uninspiring.|$|E
500|$|Although many attend regular {{education}} classes, some children with AS may utilize {{special education services}} because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, yet some do marry and work independently. The [...] "different-ness" [...] adolescents experience can be traumatic. Anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as <b>inattention,</b> withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical experience suggests the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by systematic empirical studies.|$|E
500|$|Pistrucci {{submitted}} a lengthy letter of advice {{to aid in}} hardening the dies, with commentary on other matters interspersed; he had the letter published in the numismatic press. The matrices were each submitted in two pieces, a ring and core, and Pistrucci cautioned that successfully making dies from them was no certainty, [...] "an accident produced by carelessness or <b>inattention</b> might in one moment entirely destroy the whole work, and without remedy". The matrices were [...] in diameter; Mint officials did not think they could be hardened and converted to dies without the likelihood of major damage. A few electrotypes were made from the matrices, along with some soft impressions, but no medals were struck. Improving relations between Britain and France made presentation of medals recalling Waterloo impolitic. Linecar noted that by then [...] "all the great men to whom it was intended that a specimen of the medal should be given were dead, save only the Iron Duke".|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech Review Panel report {{shed light}} on {{numerous}} efforts by Cho's family to secure help for him as early as adolescence. However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his <b>inattention</b> to classwork, his classroom absences and his asocial behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge) Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that [...] " [...] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power... that's why she came to our church– because we were helping several people like him." [...] Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by [...] "demonic power" [...] and needed [...] "deliverance." [...] Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.|$|E
