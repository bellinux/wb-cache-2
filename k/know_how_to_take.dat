25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst {{the crowd is}} Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is the}} bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for a child who is left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the situation to kill him. Marat, received by the deputies with a mixture of hostility and respect, addresses the assembly.|$|E
500|$|Barney was {{notoriously}} non-monogamous, a {{fact that}} the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, {{at a time when the}} writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and the mother of two daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel. Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values when she said, [...] "Civilized beings are those who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> more from life than others." [...] Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. [...] Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.|$|E

2500|$|On October 12, 2004, a {{few months}} before his death, Hedberg sat in on the news with Robin Quivers on The Howard Stern Show. He {{appeared}} on the show again on March 17, 2005, just 12 days before his death, and briefly discussed his drug use, saying, [...] "Well, you know, I got the drugs under control now." [...] Stern asked, [...] "Do you? You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them responsibly?" [...] Hedberg replied, [...] "Yeah, you know, just for the creative side of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simulation of an algorithm: {{computer}} (computor) language: Knuth {{advises the}} reader that [...] "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it [...] [...] [...] immediately take pen and paper and work through an example". But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can effectively execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide {{a set of rules}} for extracting a square root.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Abbott was criticised {{after she}} claimed that at her local {{hospital}} [...] "blonde, blue-eyed Finnish girls" [...] were unsuitable as nurses {{because they had}} [...] "never met a black person before". In response Marc Wadsworth, executive member of the Anti-Racist Alliance, who is half-Finnish, {{pointed out that the}} then-current Miss Finland, Lola Odusoga, is black, of Nigerian and Finnish descent. [...] "She's a black Finn like me," [...] he said. Abbott's position was supported by fellow Labour MP Bernie Grant: [...] "Bringing someone here from Finland who has never seen a black person before and expecting them to have some empathy with black people is nonsense. Scandinavian people don't know black people—they probably don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their temperature".|$|E
