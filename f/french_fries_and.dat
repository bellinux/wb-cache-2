An increased number of food processing plants, creating items such as <b>french</b> <b>fries</b> <b>and</b> potato chips, have also benefitted from access to the increased potato crop and the ease of transporting off the island. Time-critical seafood has also increased exports from Prince Edward Island since 1997.|$|E

40|$|Mushrooms were {{soaked in}} water or salt {{solution}} covered with batter, <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>and</b> then blast frozen. Average weight loss/gain {{for the process}} for water soaked mushrooms (6 hr soak) was nil. The frozen product had a high quality shelf life of at least 9 months. Samples <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>and</b> frozen within 2 hr of picking had a better flavour and softer texture than those kept at 18 C and processed 24 hours later. <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> mushrooms that had been soaked in water or salt solution had a better flavour and texture than unsoaked ones. If the amount of batter used was increased an overall gain in mushroom weight for the process was obtained. However, product acceptability was adversely affected. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be soaked, coated with batter and then frozen. This results in a significant gain (up to 89 % of initial weight) to the processor since the weight loss encountered at the frying stage is now {{passed on to the}} consumer. The quality of this product was tested after 4 months and was satisfactory...|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} 1956 there were {{suggestions}} {{in the scientific}} literature that trans fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed. In fact, by the 1980s, fats of animal origin {{had become one of}} the greatest concerns of dieticians. Activists, such as Phil Sokolof, who took out full page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonald's <b>french</b> <b>fries</b> <b>and</b> urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils. The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to switch to trans fats.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration {{announced}} that acrylamide {{can be found}} in baked and fried starchy foods, such as potato chips, breads, and cookies. Concern was raised mainly because of the probable carcinogenic effects of acrylamide. This was followed by a strong, but short-lived, interest from the press. On August 26, 2005, California attorney general Bill Lockyer filed a lawsuit against four makers of <b>french</b> <b>fries</b> <b>and</b> potato chips – H.J. Heinz Co., Frito-Lay, Kettle Foods Inc., and Lance Inc. – to reduce the risk to consumers from consuming acrylamide. The lawsuit was settled on August 1, 2008, with the food producers agreeing to cut acrylamide levels to 275 parts per billion in three years, to avoid a Proposition 65 warning label. The companies avoided trial by agreeing to pay a combined $3 million in fines as a settlement with the California attorney general's office.|$|E

To measure this westernization trend, data from a survey of Chinese consumers in Beijing is evaluated using a multinomial ordered logit model to determine which consumer attributes influence the probability of consuming western foods such as <b>French</b> <b>fries,</b> mashed potatoes, <b>and</b> potato chips. Results show that higher income levels and positive opinions concerning western food taste have a significant influence on increased consumption of all three processed potato products. Additionally, younger ages and female gender were highly significant indicators of increased <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> <b>and</b> potato chip consumption. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
