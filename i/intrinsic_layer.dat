50|$|Quantum wells {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to increase the efficiency}} of solar cells. The theoretical maximum efficiency of traditional single-junction cells is about 34%, {{due in large part to}} their inability to capture many different wavelengths of light. Multi-junction solar cells, which consist of multiple p-n junctions of different bandgaps connected in series, increase the theoretical efficiency by broadening the range of absorbed wavelengths, but their complexity and manufacturing cost limit their use to niche applications. On the other hand, cells consisting of a p-i-n junction in which the intrinsic region contains one or more quantum wells, lead to an increased photocurrent over dark current, resulting in a net efficiency increase over conventional p-n cells. Photons of energy within the well depth are absorbed in the wells and generate electron-hole pairs. In room temperature conditions, these photo-generated carriers have sufficient thermal energy to escape the well faster than the recombination rate. Elaborate multi-junction quantum well solar cells can be fabricated using layer-by-layer deposition techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy or chemical vapor deposition. It has also been shown that metal or dielectric nanoparticles added above the cell lead to further increases in photo-absorption by scattering incident light into lateral propagation paths confined within the multiple-quantum-well <b>intrinsic</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} {{scientists}} have been trying both {{to increase the efficiency}} of solar cells, whilst at the same time reducing dimensions and costs. Increases in efficiency have been brought about by implanting carbon nanotubes onto the surface of solar cells {{in order to reduce the}} reflection of sunrays, as well as through the insertion of polymeric arrays into the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>layer</b> for charge separation. Results The experimental results show power rising linearly for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses between 0 – 50 nm. Wider thicknesses increase the possibility of recombination of electrons and holes, leading to perturbation of the linear behaviour of output power. This effect is studied and formulated as a function of thickness. Recognition of the critical <b>intrinsic</b> <b>layer</b> thickness can permit one to determine the length of carbon nanotube necessary for optimizing solar cells. Conclusion In this study the behaviour of output power as a function of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses has been described physically and also simulated.

This heterostructure problem {{has been a major}} limitation in application of the electroabsorption technique. The new technique only utilizes measurements from a particular solar cell, and is thus a significant improvement on earlier techniques requiring measurements on auxiliary films.
