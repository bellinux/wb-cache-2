From 70 to 100 {{percent of the}} cones from several collecting periods were injured. Moderate damage (40 - 70 percent of cones injured) occurred to Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, and western white pine from a few areas. Light damage (less than 40 percent) occurred on western white pine cones from a few seed production areas, and to all lodgepole pine and western hemlock cones collected. The primary insect species observed were western spruce budworm on Douglas-fir and western larch; midges on Douglas-fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine; cone worms on Douglas-fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine; and the <b>Douglas-fir</b> <b>cone</b> <b>moth</b> on Douglas-fir...|$|E

40|$|Six {{species of}} insects were found attacking limber pine cones from July 26, 1968, through October 4, 1969, in Cache National Forest. The three species {{considered}} of major importance are: Conophthorus flexilis Hopkins, Dioryctria abietella (D. 2 Ì† 6 S.), and D. sp. near or disclusa Heinrich. The three minor species encountered are; Bradysia sp., Trogoderma parabile Beal, and Asynapta keeni (Foote). In {{addition to the}} major and minor cone pests three parasites, Apanteles sp. prob. starki Mason, Elacherus sp., and Hypopteromalus percussor Girault were found associated with the cone pests. C. flexilis, which completely destroys the cone, was ranked as the number one pest {{on the basis of}} numbers present plus severity of damage. During 1968 and 1969 C. flexilis destroyed 11. 47 percent of the 1500 cones examined, with a mean of 5. 87 larvae per infested <b>cone.</b> The <b>cone</b> <b>moths,</b> D. abietella and D. sp. near or disclusa, were ranked second and third in importance respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{impact of}} various factors on seed {{production}} in a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seed orchard in western Oregon was examined by monitoring {{the fate of}} seeds in thirty cones, stratified into three crown levels, on each of ten trees during the 1984 growing season. Cones were examined monthly between April and September for mortality or evidence of insect damage. In September, a sample of mature cones was collected and completely dissected. Each seed was examined for extractability, insect damage, or unexplained abortion. Abortion of immature cones was found to start early in the growing season and had a substantial impact on seed production. A newly discovered cone-feeding weevil (Lepesome leconei) caused {{a large proportion of}} this abortion. Unexplained cone abortion (possibly frost damage), empty and aborted seed, <b>Douglas-fir</b> <b>cone</b> gall Midge (Contarinia oregpnensis) and Douglas-fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus spermotrophus) were other major causes of seed loss. Crown stratification was found to be important for an accurate estimate of the importance of these various seed loss factors. A basis for an inventory-monitoring system for Douglas-fir seed production is suggested based on early monitoring of immature cones, identifying specific seed loss factors, stratified crown sampling, and an adequate sample size...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation for}} the exceptional diversity of herbivorous insects emphasizes host shift as the major driver of speciation. However, phylogenetic studies have often demonstrated widespread host plant conservatism by insect herbivores, calling into question the prevalence of speciation by host shift to distantly related plants. A limitation of previous phylogenetic studies is that host plants were defined at the family or genus level; thus, {{it was unclear whether}} host shifts predominate at a finer taxonomic scale. The lack of a statistical approach to test the hypothesis of host-shift-driven speciation also hindered studies at the species level. Here, we analyze the radiation of leaf <b>cone</b> <b>moths</b> (Caloptilia) associated with maples (Acer) using a newly developed, phylogeny-based method that tests the role of host shift in speciation. This method has the advantage of not requiring complete taxon sampling from an entire radiation. Based on 254 host plant records for 14 Caloptilia species collected at 73 sites in Japan, we show that major dietary changes are more concentrated toward the root of the phylogeny, with host shift playing a minor role in recent speciation. We suggest that there may be other roles for host shift in promoting herbivorous insect diversification rather than facilitating speciation per se...|$|R
40|$|Many insects exploit {{sections}} {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} as foraging or attraction cues, detecting wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV; ~ 300 â€“ 400 nm), human visible (400 â€“ 750 nm) and infrared (> 750 nm) range. Two distinct types of receptors are involved. Compound eyes in the head detect UV and human visible light, and IR receptors on the thorax or abdomen detect radiant IR which contrasts against the background and is therefore dectable. I investigated the potential use of electromagnetic foraging cues in three members of the conophagous insect guild: the diurnal Western conifer seed bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidermann (Hemiptera: Coreidae), the nocturnal fir coneworm moth, Dioryctria abietivorella GrotÃ© (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and the diurnal <b>Douglas-fir</b> <b>cone</b> gall midge, Contarinia oregonensis Foote (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). In electrophysiological recordings, two-choice laboratory bioassays, and field trapping experiments, I tested the hypotheses that during (cone) foraging C. oregonensis, D. abietivorella and L. occidentalis (1) rely on IR receptors that receive and respond to cone-derived radiant IR, (2) receive and respond to cone or plant-derived colour cues, and (3) integrate radiant IR and insect visible light cues. My data support these hypotheses, at least in part. Male and female L. occidentalis were more attracted to radiant IR from heat sources within but not outside the natural cone temperature range. Male and female D. abietivorella have IR receptors on their ventral prothorax which help them detect and discriminate between IR stimuli. Both D. abietivorella and C. oregonensis are attracted to warm objects with IR signatures resembling or corresponding to those of tree branches but not those of cones. No insects oriented towards cone-reflected light as a singular foraging cue, but mated female L. occidentalis preferred the complete light spectrum of conifer needles (their oviposition site) to a narrow bandwidth of visible light. Visible (blue) light combined with radiant IR from a 40 ÂºC heat source were synergistic in attracting female L. occidentalis, indicating that the central nervous system of L. occidentalis is capable of processing and integrating information from compound eyes and IR receptors. Such integration of visible stimuli and IR was previously known only in viperid snakes...|$|R
5000|$|Pseudotsuga [...] is a genus of {{evergreen}} {{coniferous trees}} in the family Pinaceae. Common names include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, and Oregon pine. Pseudotsuga menziesii is widespread in western North America and is {{an important source of}} timber. The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged. [...] Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas-firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and even Sequoia. Because of their distinctive <b>cones,</b> <b>Douglas-firs</b> were finally placed in the new genus Pseudotsuga (meaning [...] "false hemlock") by the French botanist CarriÃ¨re in 1867.

40|$|Polyunsaturated {{hydrocarbons}} (Type II pheromone components) {{have been}} reported to be synergists for unsaturated acetates, alcohols or aldehydes (Type I components) in the sex pheromones of several species of Lepidoptera. However, there is some debate over whether the active components are the hydrocarbons themselves or more volatile degradation products. Extracts of pheromone glands of adult females of the <b>cone</b> <b>moth,</b> Dioryctria mendacella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), contain (Z,E) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienyl acetate (ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac) and at least ten times as much (Z,Z,Z,Z,Z) - 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 -pentacosapentaene (ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H). The former elicits a strong electroantennogram response from males while no response could be recorded to the latter. In field trapping tests, both compounds were individually unattractive to male D. mendacella moths, but blends of the two compounds containing at least a 10 : 1 ratio of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H : ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac were highly attractive. The relatively involatile hydrocarbon was shown to be released from the dispensers used and no significant degradation could be detected. Furthermore, blends of ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac and analogs of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H with fewer carbons and/or double bonds that might be expected to produce similar degradation products to ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H were unattractive. This indicated a specific response to the hydrocarbon itself, further substantiated by the observation that related hydrocarbons did not interfere with the activity of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H. Thus a three-step conversion of fish oil was used to produce a blend of unsaturated hydrocarbons containing ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H as the major component, albeit only 30 % of the total, and a blend of this material with ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac was as attractive to male D. mendacella moths as blends with an equivalent amount of the purified material. This mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons is much cheaper to produce than the pure pentaene, and may be useful in lures for other species using these compounds. Dioryctria mendacella is a major constraint to production of edible pine kernels throughout the Mediterranean region. Pheromone traps will provide a means to improve monitoring of seasonal flight patterns and changes in population abundance of this pest...|$|R

40|$|Fire frequency, intensity, {{and size}} can {{influence}} the nature of forest development, with potentially profound effects on ecosystem processes and the abundance of native species. The effect of an intense wildfire and subsequent severe fires within a short period (reburns) on forest establishment, composition, and structure was examined in the 16, 000 ha Siouxon Creek watershed in the western Cascades of southern Washington. Evidence of large intense fires and small patchy fires {{was found in the}} watershed, with 4 fires occurring since 1900. Tree establishment was rapid and abundant throughout most of the area burned in the 1902 fire, possibly from survival of on-site seed sources. Tree establishment was delayed on most reburns and corresponded with years of abundant regional <b>Douglas-fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii) <b>cone</b> production, indicating off-site sources of seed. Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) was less abundant on reburns than on the 1902 burn. The ranges of Douglas-fir ages within stands were greater on reburns than on single burns, but fire frequency effects could not be distinguished from potential stand age and composition effects. There were no clear patterns of tree species abundance related to presumed dispersal distances of up to 3 km from unburned forest.
