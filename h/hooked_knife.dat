So many of the grapes are harvested and manufactured in common that it is necessary the vintage should begin on a fixed day, and no one was allowed to anticipate or postpone. Some cut the grapes, and dropped them into the flattish wooden barrels, which others, after mashing the berries with a long wooden pestle, bore off and emptied frothing and gurgling into big casks mounted on carts. These were then driven into the village, where the mess was poured into the presses, and the wine crushed out to the last bitter dregs. The vineyards were a scene of activity, but not hilarity, though a little way off they looked rather lively with the vintagers at work in them. We climbed to one of them far up the mountain-side one day, where a family were gathering the grapes on a slope almost as steep as a house roof, father, mother, daughter, son-in-law, big boy, and big girl all silently busy together. There were bees and wasps humming around the tubs of crushed grapes in the pale afternoon sun; the view of the lake and the mountains was inspiring; but there was nothing bacchanalian in the affair, unless the thick calves of the girl, as she bent over to cut the clusters, suggested a Mænad fury. These poor people were quite songless, though I am bound to say that in another vineyard I did hear some of the children singing. It had momentarily stopped raining; but it soon began again, and the vintage went sorrowfully on in the mud. All Villeneuve smelt of the harsh juice and pulp arriving from the fields in the wagons, carts, tubs, and barrels which crowded the streets and sidewalks, and in divers cavernous basements the presses were at work, and there was a slop and drip of new wine everywhere. After dark the people came in from the fields and gossiped about their doors, and the red light of flitting lanterns blotched the steady rainpour. Outside of the village rose the black mountains, white at the top with their snows.|$|E

40|$|Background: Natural orifice transluminal {{endoscopic}} surgery has received much attention in recent years. Instead of using prototype devices, we explored the feasibility and practicability of using readily available off-the-shelf devices to perform Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery in an animal model. Methods: Twenty pigs underwent transvaginal cholecystectomy, 16 {{of which were}} used for surviving study after the procedure. A single-channel endoscope and standard instruments for endoscopic submucosal dissection (<b>hook</b> <b>knife</b> and Insulated Tip knife) were used for cholecystectomy. A single 5 -mm laparoscopic port was inserted for gallbladder retraction. Results: Completion of the procedure was achieved in all 20 pigs. In 16 pigs, which were used for surviving study after surgery, 15 survived. Death of 1 pig was due to leakage of urine from the colpotomy and urogenital sinus. Technical success was achieved in the access, dissection, and retrieval of specimen in all the animals. Conclusions: A hybrid approach with single-channel endoscope together with endoscopic submucosal dissection instruments for transvaginal cholecystectomy was shown {{to be safe and}} feasible in this pig model and this serves as a good training model before application of this technique in human.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the arthroscopically accessible {{anatomy of the}} tarsal collateral ligaments in the horse. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. ANIMALS: Cadaveric equine hind limbs (n = 24) obtained from horses without tarsal disease. METHODS: Two pairs of tarsal joints were used to obtain silicone models of the tarsocrural joint and dissect the tarsal collateral ligaments (CLs). Ten pairs of tarsocrural joints had arthroscopic exploration and the accessible parts of the tarsal CLs were marked with an arthroscopic <b>hook</b> <b>knife.</b> Subsequently, the limbs were dissected and the marked positions were allocated to the specific parts of the CLs. RESULTS: Ipsilateral arthroscope and instrument portals were used in each pouch of the tarsocrural joint. Via the plantaromedial pouch, the superficial (2 / 20 limbs), middle (7), deep (6) or both middle and deep (3) short medial CL and the long medial CL (14) were reached. Access via the plantarolateral pouch allowed manipulation of the deep short lateral CL (20 / 20 limbs) and the long lateral CL (20). Dorsally, arthroscopy via the dorsomedial pouch gave access to the deep short medial CL (20 / 20 limbs), while the superficial (9) or middle (10) or both superficial and middle (1) short lateral CL could be reached via the dorsolateral joint recess.

Some case reports describe different endoscopic approaches, including endoscopic electrocision with a papillotomy <b>knife</b> or <b>hook</b> <b>knife.</b> We report a case of a colorectal anastomosis web occlusion, treated without electrocision. Gastrografin enema and sigmoidoscopy showed complete obstruction at the anastomotic site due to the presence of an anastomotic occlusive web.

A written questionnaire -in-cluding 201 structured items was sent to all 180 hospitals and departments performing gen-eral or abdominal surgery in Bavaria. RESULTS: The response rate was 60 %. A total of 16 615 operations for gallstone disease including 16 051 cholecystectomies and 453 CBD explo-ra-tions with or without cholecystectomy were -reported. 88 % of all cholcystectomies started -laparoscopically, the conversion rate was 5. 6 %. The Veres needle (69 %), 4 trocar techniques and electrosurgical <b>hook</b> <b>knife</b> were reported as standard procedures. A retrieval bag was used by 53 % of all surgeons. The overall complication rate for cholecystectomy was 5. 46 % including 0. 15 % -major bile duct injuries. Relaparoscopy was performed in 0. 35 %, relaparotomy in 0. 44 % and postoperative treatment by ERC in 1. 45 %. The overall hospital mortality rate was 0. 13 %. When choledocholithiasis was suspected, a two-stage management ("therapeutic splitting") with preoperative ERC was preferred (99 %). The conversion rate of simultaneous laparoscopic CHE+CBD exploration was 43 %. CONCLUSION: These results allow an estimation of the frequency and overall risks in surgical therapy for gallstones.

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of a water-jet hybrid knife to facilitate wedge hepatic resection using a natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach in a non-survival porcine model. METHODS: The Erbe Jet 2 water-jet system allows a needleless, tissue-selective hydro-dissection with a pre-selected pressure. Using this system, wedge hepatic resection was performed through three natural routes (trans-anal, trans-vaginal and trans-umbilical) in three female pigs weighing 35 kg under general anesthesia. Entry into the peritoneal cavity was via a 15 -mm incision using a <b>hook</b> <b>knife.</b> The targeted liver segment was marked by an APC probe, followed by wedge hepatic resection performed using a water-jet hybrid knife {{with the aid of}} a 4 -mm transparent distance soft cap mounted onto the tip of the endoscope for holding up the desired plane. The exposed vascular and ductal structures were clipped with Endoclips. Hemostasis was applied to the bleeding cut edges of the liver parenchyma by electrocautery. After the procedure, the incision site was left open, and the animal was euthanized followed by necropsy. RESULTS: Using the Erbe Jet 2 water-jet system, trans-anal and trans-vaginal wedge hepatic resection was successfully performed in two pigs without laparoscopic assistance. Trans-umbilical attempt failed due to an unstable operating platform. The incision for peritoneal entry took 1 min, and about 2 h was spent on excision of the liver tissue. The intra-operative blood loss ranged from 100 to 250 mL. Microscopically, the hydro-dissections were relatively precise and gentle, preserving most vessels. CONCLUSION: The Erbe Jet 2 water-jet system can safely accomplish non-anatomic wedge hepatic resection in NOTES, which deserves further studies to shorten the dissection time...|$|R

As a result of the analysis components and sizes were selected for a real system that could be implemented at the abattoir. This project seeks ultimately to improve abattoir operations by reducing non-renewable energy use through the development of a solar thermal system. Its outcomes have the potential to benefit the wider industry...|$|R
2500|$|Opponents of the whaling often {{cite the}} methods, which involve <b>knives,</b> <b>hooks,</b> and the chasing of whales by powerboats, as being {{inherently}} cruel to social animals capable of communication within their species. Opponents further note that most whale drives {{do not take}} [...] "a few minutes" [...] as often cited by Faroese government officials. However, the drive itself is often included in this figure, which takes a significantly longer time than the actual kills, which are usually all complete in less than half an hour.|$|R
5000|$|In Tibetan iconography, it is {{depicted}} in the Vajrayana as a weapon of strength and tenacity. The Vajrayan weapons which have makara symbolism are; axe, iron <b>hook,</b> curved <b>knife,</b> vajra, and ritual dragon, in all of which the theme is [...] "emergence of the blade from the open mouth of the makara".Its symbolic representation {{in the form of}} a makara head at the corner of temple roofs is as water element which also functions as a [...] "rainwater spout or gargoyle". It is also seen as water spouts at the source of a spring. The artistic carving in stone is in the form of identical pair of makaras flanked by two Nāgas (snake gods) along with a crown of Garuda, which is called the kirtimukha face. Such depictions are also seen at the entrance of wooden doorways as the top arch and also as a torana behind Buddha's images.|$|R
