5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form <b>for</b> <b>emphasis</b> or effect.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E

5|$|The 250-metre {{long and}} 35-metre tall {{building}} has nine floors, but {{the height of}} the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt Travertine marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that the passive voice is useful <b>for</b> <b>emphasis,</b> or when the receiver of the action {{is more important than}} the actor.|$|E
25|$|All vocal {{languages}} use pitch pragmatically in intonation—for instance <b>for</b> <b>emphasis,</b> {{to convey}} surprise or irony, or {{to pose a}} question. Tonal languages such as Chinese and Hausa use intonation in addition to using pitch for distinguishing words.|$|E

25|$|Fingerspelling {{is used in}} {{different}} sign languages and registers for different purposes. It {{may be used to}} represent words from an oral language which have no sign equivalent, or <b>for</b> <b>emphasis,</b> clarification, or when teaching or learning a sign language.|$|E
25|$|Moynihan was {{a popular}} public speaker with a {{distinctly}} patrician style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, {{in the form of}} slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> Linguist Geoffrey Nunberg compared his speaking style to that of William F. Buckley, Jr.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the new 1990s time frame, events in the past are {{generally}} aged by ten years, though not always. The first edition also featured illustrations by Dennis Nix. Later printings dropped the illustrations, used a smaller typeface, and switched from bold to italics <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also {{note that}} kutja or kokutja can be {{inserted}} before the intentional concord <b>for</b> additional <b>emphasis.</b>|$|R

25|$|Male authors came {{to write}} {{literature}} using hiragana. Hiragana {{was used for}} unofficial writing such as personal letters, while katakana and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with katakana writing. Katakana is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The word sim ("yes") may be {{used for}} a {{positive}} answer, but, if used alone, it may in certain cases sound unnatural or impolite. In Brazilian Portuguese, sim can be used after the verb <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> In European Portuguese, emphasis in answers is added with the duplication of the verb. In both versions of Portuguese, emphasis can also result from syntactical processes that are not restricted to answers, such as the addition of adverbs like muito ("much") or muitíssimo ("very much").|$|E
25|$|In modern Japanese, kanji {{are used}} to write parts of the {{language}} (usually content words) such as nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems, while hiragana {{are used to}} write inflected verb and adjective endings and as phonetic complements to disambiguate readings (okurigana), particles, and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji is considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. Katakana are mostly used for representing onomatopoeia, non-Japanese loanwords (except those borrowed from ancient Chinese), the names {{of plants and animals}} (with exceptions), and <b>for</b> <b>emphasis</b> on certain words.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from their}} highly inflected forms, German {{relative}} pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one {{is based on}} the definite article der, die, das, but with distinctive forms in the genitive (dessen, deren) and in the dative plural (denen). Historically this is related to English that. The second, which is more literary and used <b>for</b> <b>emphasis,</b> is the relative use of welcher, welche, welches, comparable with English which. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{uses the}} diaeresis. For example, in ruïne {{it means that}} the u and the i are {{separately}} pronounced in their usual way, and not {{in the way that the}} combination ui is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the i. Diacritics can be used <b>for</b> <b>emphasis</b> (érg koud for very cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (één appel = one apple, een appel = an apple; vóórkomen = to occur, voorkómen = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.|$|E
25|$|A two-handed manual alphabet, {{identical}} to the one used in British Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, is integral to Auslan. This alphabet is used for fingerspelling proper nouns such as personal or place names, common nouns for everyday objects, and English words, especially technical terms, {{for which there is no}} widely used sign. Fingerspelling can also be used <b>for</b> <b>emphasis,</b> clarification, or, sometimes extensively, by English-speaking learners of Auslan. The amount of fingerspelling varies with the context and the age of the signer. A recent small-scale study puts fingerspelled words in Auslan conversations at about 10% of all lexical items, roughly equal to ASL and higher than many other sign languages, such as New Zealand Sign Language. The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time.|$|E

500|$|Before its execution, its {{planners}} {{sometimes referred}} to the purge as Hummingbird (German: [...] ), the codeword used to send the execution squads into action {{on the day of}} the purge. The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase [...] "Night of the Long Knives" [...] in the German language predates the killings and refers generally to acts of vengeance. Germans still use the term [...] to describe the killings, the term given to it by the Nazi regime, despite its unproven implication that they were necessary to prevent a coup. German authors often [...] use quotation marks or write about the [...] ("so-called Röhm Putsch") <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Aggies {{today will}} often end public {{addresses}} and emails to other Aggies with a hearty [...] "Thanks and Gig 'em!". The [...] "Gig 'em" [...] tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before {{the football game}} against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate {{and member of the}} school's Board of Regents, asked [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] <b>For</b> <b>emphasis,</b> he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't Look Any Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects <b>for</b> <b>emphasis.</b> He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes in the room with Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, that is really effective." ...|$|E
