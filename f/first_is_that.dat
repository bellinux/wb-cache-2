5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} the satellite communications. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|This cut-marked human bone {{assemblage}} {{represented the}} largest yet identified from within a Neolithic long barrow in southern Britain, although similar evidence for dismemberment {{has been found}} from other Neolithic British sites, such as West Trump, Eyford, Aldestrop, and Haddenham. There are two possibilities for how this material developed. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the bodies of the}} dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements, followed by a secondary burial within the tomb. The second is that they were placed in the tomb, where the flesh decomposed, before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself. These practices may have been accompanied by other ritualistic or ceremonial practices, direct evidence for which does not survive.|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. <b>First</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E

"The <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> {{no current}} {{arrangements}} {{for admission to}} the sixth form on the school’s website and the second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the school required applicants to attend a selection interview {{as part of the}} admission arrangements to the sixth form.|$|R
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
50|$|When {{his case}} was heard, Wintle was read the three charges against him. The <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had feigned {{defective}} eyesight (and infirmity, to avoid active duty). This charge was dismissed after Wintle's defence provided medical evidence.|$|R
60|$|Many results {{followed}} {{from this}} change in the old man. One of the <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Kenneth and Lizzie Gordon were married, Bucephalus was not sold, and Dan Horsey was retained {{in the service of}} his young master.|$|R
30|$|The two {{conclusions}} {{presented in}} the original paper still stand.

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Paris Accord {{that ended}} the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the outset, in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the cease-fire.|$|R

25|$|Debate {{around the}} best method of tick removal is based around two main concerns. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the method of removal could cause further {{injection}} of noxious substances (allergens, paralysing toxins and infectious micro-organisms). The second is that the method may leave the 'head' (really just the tick's mouthparts) embedded in the skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{complications}} of SEMS {{are related to}} a number of factors. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the endoscopic procedure used to insert a SEMS involves the use of sedative medications, which may lead to oversedation, aspiration, or drug reaction. SEMS also expand and can lead to perforation of the bowel or compression of structures adjacent to the bowel.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} {{hypothesis is}} best described using three principles. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many brain systems are activated by visual input, and the activations by these different inputs compete for processing access. Secondly, competition occurs in multiple brain systems and is integrated amongst these individual systems. Finally, competition {{can be assessed}} (using top-down neural priming) based on the relevant characteristics of the object at hand.|$|E

25|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward regarding the origin of Burlington's name. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was named after Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, {{and the second is}} that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{speciation}} {{is a genuine}} problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, {{there is not a single}} population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.|$|E
