5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> this indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E

According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E

Harris tells the children not to be afraid to tell someone {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need. You know nothing gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll.

It depends on many factors—ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics." [...] <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> {{that it is time}} to promote a scientific approach to normative morality, rejecting the idea that religion determines what is good. He believes that once scientists begin proposing moral norms in papers, supernatural moral systems will join [...] "astrology, witchcraft and Greek mythology on the scrapheap".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> {{the idea}} of free will [...] "cannot be mapped on to any {{conceivable}} reality" [...] and is incoherent. According to Harris, science [...] "reveals {{you to be a}} biochemical puppet." [...] People's thoughts and intentions, <b>Harris</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control." [...] Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change {{the way we think about}} some of the most important questions in life.|$|E

2500|$|Neuroscientist and {{prominent}} ideological critic Sam Harris contrasts {{the example of}} Muhammad with that of Jesus Christ. While he regards Christ {{as something of a}} [...] "hippie" [...] figure, Muhammad is an altogether different character and one whose example [...] "as held in Islam is universally not [...] a pacifist," [...] but rather one of a [...] "conquering warlord who spread the faith by the sword." [...] Harris notes that while sayings such as [...] "render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" [...] provide Christianity with a [...] "rationale for peace," [...] it is impossible to justify non-violence as central to Islam. <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> that the example of Muhammad provides an imperative to [...] "convert, subjugate, or kill" [...] and [...] "the core principle of Islam is Jihad." [...] Harris also suggests that Muhammad [...] "may well have been schizophrenic," [...] dismissing the Prophet's claim that the Koran was dictated to him by the archangel Gabriel.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, The Moral Landscape, {{author and}} neuroscientist Sam Harris also argues against free will. He offers one thought {{experiment}} where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, {{of a particular}} human. Harris believes {{that it is no}} longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has [...] "free will". <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes [...] "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?" [...] adding that [...] "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes." [...] That is, he believes there is compelling evidence of absence of free will.|$|E

2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors in some way that facilitates mind-control. [...] Whatever this drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't know exactly what the drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem to be some sort of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E
2500|$|Understanding the biblically {{recorded}} {{sequence of}} events in Hezekiah's life as chronological or not {{is critical to the}} contextual interpretation of his reign. According to scholar Stephen L. Harris, chapter 20 of 2 Kings does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161). Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> it [...] "evidently took place before Sennacherib's invasion' when Hezekiah was [...] "trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.' Consequently, [...] "Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.' Likewise, The Archaeological Study Bible says, [...] "The presence of these riches' that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians [...] "indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah's payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 BC" [...] (564). Again, [...] "Though the king's illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described {{at the end of the}} accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria. Thus, Isaiah's chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.|$|E
2500|$|In an [...] "Op-Ed" [...] {{published}} on December 4 in The Jerusalem Post, David A. Harris, {{executive director of}} the American Jewish Committee (AJC), says that he finds it [...] "startling that a former president who prides himself on his ongoing contribution to world peace would write a crude polemic that compromises any pretense to objectivity and fairness": [...] "Carter leaves out what any reasonable observer, even those that share his basic views of the conflict, would consider obvious facts, but does include stunning distortions".; Harris [...] "cite just two of the numerous examples" [...] of what he calls [...] "such mendacity." [...] The first of these, <b>Harris</b> <b>says,</b> is that [...] "Carter discounts well-established claims that Israel accepted and Arafat rejected a generous offer to create a Palestinian state." [...] The second [...] "manifest distortion," [...] according to Harris, is that [...] "Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'"; whereas well-informed observers know that [...] "Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border." [...] In omitting [...] "these well-known developments," [...] Harris argues, Carter is [...] "leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality." ...|$|E
5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} occurred while Gregory {{halted the}} match by not sending out {{a replacement for}} Murdoch. The New South Wales skipper called on Lord Harris to remove umpire Coulthard, whom he considered to be inept or biased, but his English counterpart declined.

Eventually, Gregory agreed to resume the match without the removal of Coulthard. However, the crowd continued to disrupt proceedings, and play was abandoned for the day.

6000|$|On the vexed {{question}} of Shakespear's social standing Mr <b>Harris</b> <b>says</b> that Shakespear [...] "had {{not had the}} advantage of a middle-class training." [...] I suggest that Shakespear missed this questionable advantage, not because he was socially too low to have attained to it, but because he conceived himself as belonging to the upper class from which our public school boys are now drawn. Let Mr Harris survey for a moment the field of contemporary journalism. He will see there some men who have the very characteristics from which he infers that Shakespear was at a social disadvantage through his lack of middle-class training. They are rowdy, ill-mannered, abusive, mischievous, fond of quoting obscene schoolboy anecdotes, adepts in that sort of blackmail which consists in mercilessly libelling and insulting every writer whose opinions are sufficiently heterodox to make it almost impossible for him to risk perhaps five years of a slender income by an appeal to a prejudiced orthodox jury; and they see nothing in all this cruel blackguardism but an uproariously jolly rag, although they are by no means without genuine literary ability, a love of letters, and even some artistic conscience. But he will find not one of the models of his type (I say nothing of mere imitators of it) below the rank that looks at the middle class, not humbly and enviously from below, but insolently from above. Mr Harris himself notes Shakespear's contempt for the tradesman and mechanic, and his incorrigible addiction to smutty jokes. He does us the public service of sweeping away the familiar plea of the Bardolatrous ignoramus, that Shakespear's coarseness was part of the manners of his time, putting his pen with precision on the one name, Spenser, that is necessary to expose such a libel on Elizabethan decency. There was nothing whatever to prevent Shakespear from being as decent as More was before him, or Bunyan after him, and as self-respecting as Raleigh or Sidney, except the tradition of his class, in which education or statesmanship may no doubt be acquired by those who have a turn for them, but in which insolence, derision, profligacy, obscene jesting, debt contracting, and rowdy mischievousness, give continual scandal to the pious, serious, industrious, solvent bourgeois. No other class is infatuated enough to believe that gentlemen are born and not made by a very elaborate process of culture. Even kings are taught and coached and drilled from their earliest boyhood to play their part. But the man of family (I am convinced that Shakespear took that view of himself) will plunge into society without a lesson in table manners, into politics without a lesson in history, into the city without a lesson in business, and into the army without a lesson in honor.|$|E
