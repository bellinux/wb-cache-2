Rajo put the pieces onto the bed of the truck, grabbed the necessary tools, and said [...] "You drive, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> thing together on the road".

5000|$|One of {{the cities}} {{intended}} {{to be a part of}} the AABA was Augusta, Georgia. Augusta's mayor, Deke Copenhaver, stated that he did not support the idea: [...] "As a sports enthusiast, I have always supported bringing more sporting activities to Augusta. However, in this instance I could not support in good conscience bringing in a team that did not fit with the spirit of inclusiveness that I, along with many others, have worked so hard to foster in our city." [...] Clint Bryant, athletic director at Augusta State University, described the idea for the league as [...] "absurd", and noted that it [...] "gives you an idea of the sickness of our society." [...] Dip Metress, head men's basketball director at ASU, also opposed the idea, saying [...] "nobody is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> money behind <b>this.</b> Basketball is an international game." [...] Chattanooga, Tennessee was another city targeted by Lewis' plan; a spokesman for Chattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield described Lewis' plan as [...] "absolutely ridiculous", but also added that he was unaware of anything the City could do to actually stop it.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few days}} after the 1929 cloudburst, a group of {{mountain}}eers led by Horace Kephart climbed to the crest of the Central Smokies to inspect the damage. When they reached the now-barren western flank of the Sawteeth, Charlie Conner, a mountain guide from Oconaluftee, removed his shoe, revealing a badly-swollen foot. Upon seeing this, Kephart was said to have remarked, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>this</b> <b>put</b> on a Government map for you." [...] There is another, slightlydifferent, story told by Paul M. Fink in his book"The Names and Lore of The Great Smoky Mountains"in which Fink says that one of the group upon looking at the bare rock pinnacle left by thestorm, and knowing of Conner's foot affliction,remarked: [...] "Well that sticks out like Charlie'sbunion" [...] prompting Kephart to decide on that name. The United States Geological Survey gave it the name [...] "Charlie's Bunion" [...] shortly thereafter. The mountain rising above Charlies Bunion to the west was named after Kephart himself.|$|R

She turned away her eyes from the white and gold to the dark bundle, and as her hands touched the serge, her tears began to be checked. That coarse roughness recalled her fully to the present, from which love and delight were gone. She unfastened the thick white cord and spread the bundle out on the table. It was the grey serge dress of a sister belonging to the third order of Saint Francis, living in the world but especially devoted to deeds of piety--a personage whom the Florentines were accustomed to call a Pinzochera. Romola was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on <b>this</b> dress as a disguise, and she determined <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it on at once, so that, if she needed sleep before the morning, she might wake up in perfect readiness to be gone. She put off her black garment, and as she thrust her soft white arms into the harsh sleeves of the serge mantle and felt the hard girdle of rope hurt her fingers as she tied it, she courted those rude sensations: they were in keeping with her new scorn of that thing called pleasure which made men base--that dexterous contrivance for selfish ease, that shrinking from endurance and strain, when others were bowing beneath burdens too heavy for them, which now made one image with her husband. Then she gathered her long hair together, drew it away tight from her face, bound it in a great hard knot {{at the back of her}} head, and taking a square piece of black silk, tied it in the fashion of a kerchief close across her head and under her chin; and over that she drew the cowl. She lifted the candle to the mirror. Surely her disguise would be complete to any one who had not lived very near to her. To herself she looked strangely like her brother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; the eyes, already sad, had only to become a little sunken. Was she getting more like him in anything else? Only in this, that she understood now how men could be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delights, how they could be prompted to dwell on images of sorrow rather than of beauty and joy.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Beattie did not blithely {{play along}} with the establishment. One {{occasion}} perhaps highlights this better than any: In September 1932 Lord Craigavon, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, spoke in the parliament on a motion thanking the Belfast Corporation {{for the use of}} the city hall for meetings of the Northern Ireland Parliament. Beattie, incensed, seized the mace and shouted that his motion to bring [...] "to your notice the serious position of the unemployment in Northern Ireland" [...] had been rejected. An unusual scene of uproar ensued as Tommy Henderson joined Beattie in his protests. Bardon reports that ignoring the Speaker's pleas for order, Beattie continued shouting [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> out of action....The House indulged in hypocrisy while there are starving thousands outside." [...] Beattie then wrested the mace from the sergeant-at-arms, threw it upon the floor, and walked out.|$|E

Moores, {{who wanted}} to own the next NFL {{franchise}} in Houston, met with Texas State Senator Mario Gallegos, Jr., and other local Hispanic leaders {{in regards to the}} future of a football-only Astrodome and a new baseball-only ballpark in Downtown Houston. Meanwhile, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels pieced together a plan to build a new ballpark next to the Astrodome in the Astrodomain. The Astros echoed the Astrodomain location sentiment because they believed construction time would be shorter. Eckels, who convinced then Mayor Bob Lanier of the lack of viability for the ballpark in a downtown location, was quoted as saying, [...] "They keep telling me about these miracles in other cities, but it doesn't work in Houston ... If we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> stadium some place, let's stick with a proven place." [...] This plan was considered to be nearly finalized when the Astros and Harris County agreed to a $250 million USD county-funded stadium whose overrun costs would be funded by the Astros.|$|E

Now I don't think," [...] Mr. Dane went on, leaning a little further over the table, [...] "that the Mr. Douglas Romilly who has disappeared was ever capable of writing a play. I don't think he was a man of talent at all. I don't think he could have written, for instance, 'The House of Shams.' Let us, however, leave the subject of Douglas Romilly for a moment. Let us go a little further back--to Detton Magna, let us say. Curiously enough, there was another young man who disappeared from that little Derbyshire village about the same time, who has never been heard of since. His name, too, was Romilly.
