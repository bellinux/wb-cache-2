5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative <b>hollow</b> double-gear <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative <b>hollow</b> double-gear <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b> The <b>hollow</b> shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{designs for}} the 5LM60 <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and {{bearings}} (<b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and main shaft).

50|$|The basic {{mechanism}} {{consisted of}} three moving parts, an <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> an output disk, and some sort of roller or disk between the two. Generally the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> was electrically driven and used some sort of governor to ensure it spun at a constant speed. The output was a metal disk on a shaft that was arranged {{at right angles to}} the input. That is, if the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> was vertically aligned, the output shaft would be horizontal, with the disk {{on the end of the}} output shaft lying vertically beside the input.|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the clutch is disengaged, the <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> clutch disk and countershaft can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> and clutch, and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|R
5000|$|The early model C4 (1964-1969) used a [...]788-inch 24-spline <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{which was}} {{upgraded}} in 1970 to 26-spline and [...]839-inch.

25|$|Currently, three {{variations}} of clutch installation are used. The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches {{shared the same}} plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> along the same centre line as the engine crankshaft; when viewed head-on {{along the length of}} the <b>input</b> <b>shaft,</b> this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.|$|R

50|$|A hydroviscous drive {{consists}} {{of one or}} more discs connected to the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> pressed against a similar disc or discs connected to the output shaft.

The transmitted torque is proportional to the pressure exerted by a hydraulic cylinder that presses the discs together.|$|R
50|$|The <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is mounted}} {{eccentrically}} to a Rolling-element bearing (typically a cylindrical roller bearing), causing the cycloidal disc {{to move in}} a circle. The cycloidal disc will independently rotate around the bearing as it is pushed against the ring gear. This is similar to planetary gears, and the direction of rotation is opposite {{to that of the}} <b>input</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper; two {{models of the}} <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> for a Longitudinal Mounted four Speed Automotive Automatic Transmission {{for the first time}} were {{introduced}} to describe the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> critical loads. In the first model; the DC (Di rect Clutch) connects two gears together. This gives no change in the set torque (the set output torque equal to the set input torque). In the second model; the ODB (Over Drive Brake) fixes one element of the planetary set. This is resulting, the gear set gives reduction ratio (the set output torque is not equal to the set input torque). So, the transmission <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is worked under two different working operating conditions of torque.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical, simulation, {{and practical}} analyses of a variable speed magnetic gearbox (MG) that uses contra-rotating (CR) <b>input</b> <b>shafts.</b> The CR turbine comprises {{two sets of}} rotors one behind the other: one rotor rotates in a clockwise direction while the other rotor rotates in an anticlockwise direction.

50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the <b>input</b> and output <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft.
