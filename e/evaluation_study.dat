40|$|Obviously, {{evaluations}} of parenting programmes {{are important for}} improving clinical practice. Such <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> can show us whether a parenting programme works and for whom and under which circumstances the programme has the best effects. An additional, often neglected, role of <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> {{is to provide a}} test of the theory on which the programme is based. In the present paper, we discuss the ways in which <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> can be used to test and refine theories pertaining to parenting behaviour and child development. Several examples of such studies are presented and both conceptual (specifying the theory-based expectations regarding working mechanisms) and methodological issues (quality criteria for real-life <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> of parenting programmes) involved in evaluation research are addressed...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{significance}} of <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> {{as well as the}} interest in adequate methods and approaches for evaluation has grown in medical informatics. In order to put this discussion into historical perspective of evaluation research, we conducted a systematic review on trends in evaluation research of information technology in health care from 1982 to 2002. In a first step of our inventory, we concentrated on describing long-term developments e. g. in study questions and methods used of IT <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> as described in the abstracts of the identified 1. 035 publications. In the second step of our inventory, we now analysed 64 randomly selected full papers on <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies,</b> in order to answer two questions: Did IT <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> show a positive effect of IT on quality of processes or outcome quality of patient care, and how did the quality of <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> themselves develop in the last 20 years. Appropriateness of the care process was the most common and mostly positively evaluated aspect. There was a trend towards more multi-centre studies. The quality of the studies remained stable over time. Randomized controlled trials had significantly higher quality than non-RCT studie...|$|R

40|$|The strongest {{tradition}} of IR systems evaluation {{has focused on}} system effectiveness; more recently, {{there has been a}} growing interest in evaluation of Interactive IR systems, balancing system and user-oriented evaluation criteria. In this paper we shift the focus to considering how IR systems, and particularly digital libraries, can be evaluated to assess (and improve) their fit with users’ broader work activities. Taking this focus, we answer a different set of evaluation questions that reveal more about the design of interfaces, user–system interactions and how systems may be deployed in the information working context. The planning and conduct of such <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> share some features with the established methods for conducting IR <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies,</b> but come with a shift in emphasis; for example, a greater range of ethical considerations may be pertinent. We present the PRET A Rapporter framework for structuring user-centred <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> and illustrate its application to three <b>evaluation</b> <b>studies</b> of digital library systems...|$|R
