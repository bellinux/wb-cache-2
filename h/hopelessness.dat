5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree. When a staff officer sought to make him aware of the <b>hopelessness</b> of the situation, Kesselring {{told him that he}} had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and <b>hopelessness</b> brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|In {{its current}} version, the BDI-II is {{designed}} for individuals aged 13 and over, and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as <b>hopelessness</b> and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, {{as well as physical}} symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest in sex.|$|E
5|$|Heather has {{had enough}} of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fueled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, she takes the baby and walks out ("Too Much, Too Soon"). Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the <b>hopelessness</b> he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and was shocked by the news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or <b>hopelessness</b> of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and <b>hopelessness</b> which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of <b>hopelessness</b> that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an {{insensitive}} personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the students and Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male and was very strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's <b>hopelessness</b> as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1945 Königsberg {{fell to the}} Red Army, and on 13 April Dietrich's SS {{unit was}} forced out of Vienna. The Battle of Berlin began at 03:30 on 16 April with a massive {{artillery}} barrage. Within the week, fighting was taking place inside the city. Among the many elements defending Berlin were French, Latvian, and Scandinavian Waffen-SS troops. Hitler, now living in the Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery, still hoped that his remaining SS soldiers could rescue the capital. In spite of the <b>hopelessness</b> of the situation, members of the SS patrolling the city continued to shoot or hang soldiers and civilians for what they considered to be acts of cowardice or defeatism. The Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May, two days after Hitler committed suicide. As members of SS expected little mercy from the Red Army, they attempted to move westward to surrender to the western Allies instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the <b>hopelessness</b> of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to <b>hopelessness</b> as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the <b>hopelessness</b> of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of <b>hopelessness</b> that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|A pervading {{sense of}} <b>hopelessness,</b> {{brought on by}} {{physical}} exhaustion, poverty and monotony.|$|E
25|$|Loss of, {{or changes}} in, one's system of meanings, which may include {{a loss of}} {{sustaining}} faith or a sense of <b>hopelessness</b> and despair.|$|E
25|$|The trauma {{resulting}} from these crimes included {{a range of}} {{mental and physical health}} problems including feelings of <b>hopelessness,</b> flashbacks, erectile dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction, and coital pain.|$|E
25|$|Hope - a {{man trying}} {{to break out of}} the museum of <b>hopelessness.</b> His muscles, brain and {{backbone}} have been removed and his pickaxe has been blunted, rendering his attempt hopeless.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu Vilandré and Steve Chartier (aka Esteve Decalisse) {{were brought}} on guitar and bass {{respectively}} {{just in time}} for touring in support of Fuck the Fact’s next release, Legacy of <b>Hopelessness.</b> This six-song EP had been recorded in the fall of 2004 and was co-released in June 2005 through Topon's Ghetto Blaster Recordings and Steve's label Capital Kill. A much more experimental release, Legacy of <b>Hopelessness</b> featured more electronic and ambient elements combined with the usual Fuck the Facts grindcore sound. The summer support tour for the EP took the band all the way from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|People with {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} are particularly {{likely to use}} emotional blackmail (as too are destructive narcissists). However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of <b>hopelessness,</b> rather than being the product of any conscious plan.|$|E
25|$|Joyner, {{now seeing}} the <b>hopelessness</b> of South Carolinas situation, decided to fire her guns one last time, {{not wishing to}} {{surrender}} with his cannons loaded. He then struck, ending the battle. The British took possession of South Carolina and transferred their prisoners over to the British ships.|$|E
25|$|The social {{stigma of}} the drug also {{complicated}} studies of PCE; researchers labored under the awareness that their findings would have political implications. In addition, the perceived <b>hopelessness</b> of 'crack babies' may have caused researchers to ignore possibilities for early intervention that could have helped them. The social stigma {{may turn out to}} be a self-fulfilling prophecy.|$|E
25|$|Seeing the <b>hopelessness</b> of his position, Bergeret sent ensign Hugon {{on a boat}} to {{negotiate}} a capitulation, offering to surrender Psyché {{in exchange for the}} British permitting his crew to keep their personal weapons and effects and to stay aboard overnight to attend to the wounded. Lambert accepted the terms and Bergeret struck his colours at midnight.|$|E
25|$|Peter Hays {{has refused}} to give his lawyer any {{information}} on his background, something that counted against him with the district attorney, and seems depressed {{to the point of}} <b>hopelessness,</b> using the novel's title Might as well be dead to describe how he feels. This tends to validate Archie's tentative identification, but a personal meeting of Archie with Hays would be needed to be sure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} and last issue of the 2001 DC Vertigo miniseries Enemy Ace: War In Heaven, lead {{character}} Hans von Hammer leads a Luftwaffe flight against USAAF bomber formations with him piloting a scarlet red Me 262 that has no swastika tail insignia. Seeing the <b>hopelessness</b> of the war, {{he and his men}} later destroy the remaining 262s in their control before surrendering to a U.S. Army unit.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{return from}} the Legacy of <b>Hopelessness</b> tour, Mathieu Vilandré and Steve Chartier were brought into the band as {{permanent}} members. It was {{at this time that}} the band recorded a two-song pre-production demo as an indicator of the direction the band would be taking for their next album. These demos were eventually released on two splits (with Pleasant Valley and Mesrine), and were used to look for a possible record deal.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Bradley Headstone {{has tried}} to put the blame for his assault on Wrayburn onto Rogue Riderhood, by {{dressing}} in similar clothes when doing the deed. Riderhood realises this and attempts to blackmail Headstone. Headstone, overcome with the <b>hopelessness</b> of his situation, especially after discovering that Wrayburn has survived and has married Lizzie, is seized with a self-destructive urge and flings himself into the lock, pulling Riderhood with him so that both are drowned.|$|E
25|$|When Backstabber Etiquette was {{recorded}} in 2002, vocalist Mel Mongeon had replaced Christoff, and her distinctive growl was markedly different than Brent's deep sound. Mel's higher pitched scream became the norm for the band. The musical style became more heavily influenced by death metal and showed more technical aspirations. This style persisted over the splits recorded between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of <b>Hopelessness</b> (these recordings are largely what make up the tracks on the Collection of Splits 2002-2004).|$|E
25|$|The bitterly fought {{uprising}} {{lasted for}} two months and resulted in the death or expulsion {{from the city of}} hundreds of thousands of civilians. After the Poles realised the <b>hopelessness</b> of the situation and surrendered on 2 October, the Germans carried out a planned destruction of Warsaw on Hitler's orders that obliterated the remaining infrastructure of the city. The Polish First Army, fighting alongside the Soviet Red Army, entered a devastated Warsaw on 17 January 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire of}} the German people to be one nation again {{remained}} strong, but {{was accompanied by a}} feeling of <b>hopelessness</b> through the 1970s and into the 1980s; Die Wende, when it arrived in the late 1980s driven by the East German people, came as a surprise, leading to the 1990 elections which put a government in place that negotiated the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany and reunited East and West Germany, and the process of inner reunification began.|$|E
25|$|Deinstitutionalisation (or deinstitutionalization) is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less isolated community mental health services for those diagnosed with a mental disorder or developmental disability. Deinstitutionalisation works in two ways: the first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates; the second focuses on reforming mental hospitals' institutional processes so as to reduce or eliminate reinforcement of dependency, <b>hopelessness,</b> learned helplessness, and other maladaptive behaviours.|$|E
25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening mammography. Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling of <b>hopelessness</b> and helplessness, largely due to their belief in fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness may be a more critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa {{were thus}} hemmed in and {{looking down the}} barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah’s letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old {{commander}} was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the <b>hopelessness</b> of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West were {{turned over to the}} British on 15 May 1815.|$|E
25|$|Legacy of <b>Hopelessness</b> showcased {{a bit of}} a {{departure}} for the band in that it had a lot more electronic influences. Keyboards are featured on nearly every track, and are sometimes the primary focus. Of course, grindcore is still quite present as well as Mel's distinctive vocals. The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Central Europe Campaign, Allied victory in Europe was inevitable. Having gambled his future ability to defend Germany on the Ardennes offensive and lost, Hitler had no real strength left to stop the powerful Allied armies. The Western Allies still had to fight, often bitterly, for victory. Even when the <b>hopelessness</b> of the German situation became obvious to his most loyal subordinates, Hitler refused to admit defeat. Only when Soviet artillery was falling around his Berlin headquarters bunker did he begin to perceive the final outcome.|$|E
25|$|Agha Mohammad Shah first {{marched to}} Astarabad, and penalized the Turkmens {{who had been}} pillaging {{the city and its}} surroundings. He then {{continued}} to Mashhad, where the local chieftains, who knew of the <b>hopelessness</b> to resist, swiftly acknowledged his rule. Agha Mohammad Shah also demanded these local chieftains to dispatch him hostages, who were sent to Tehran. When Agha Mohammad Shah reached Mashhad, Shahrokh, along with a prominent mujtahid named Mirza Mehdi, went to the Qajar encampment. There they were warmly received by Agha Mohammad Shah's nephew Hossein Qoli Khan.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{widespread}} political discontent characterized by bitter armed conflict. King Louis-Philippe of France was overthrown in the Revolution of 1848 and a republic was declared with a Provisional Government. Three new political groups emerged during that era: {{they were the}} liberals, radicals and the socialists. The combination of man-made and natural disasters in Corsica created an acute feeling of <b>hopelessness.</b> All this came about {{at a time when}} Spain was growing fearful of the possibility of a rebellion in her Caribbean possessions, which consisted of Puerto Rico and Cuba.|$|E
