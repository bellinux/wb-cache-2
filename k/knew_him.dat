5|$|Charles was universally beloved, beloved {{not only}} by the crowd of {{individuals}} with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but thoroughly popular with the mass of his subjects and particularly with the poorer populace of London who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> best.|$|E
5|$|Pryce's death, and its horrific nature, {{were met}} with great grief from all those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> during his career, {{especially}} his wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team.

5|$|Tommy Lee Jones was {{originally}} considered for another role that was ultimately {{cut from the}} film and Stone who decided to cast him as Shaw. In preparation for the film, Jones interviewed Garrison on three different occasions and talked to others {{who had worked with}} Shaw and <b>knew</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it {{was produced}} by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with people who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> and home movie footage contributed by his children.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> best in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{continued}} to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception {{from those who}} were aware of his past. Some who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but had never seen his father conduct a service.|$|E

5|$|Michael Korolenko {{directed}} the 1984 biopic Chords of Fame, which featured Bill Burnett as Ochs. The film included interviews {{with people who}} had known Ochs, including Yippies Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, manager Harold Leventhal, and Mike Porco, the owner of Gerde's Folk City. Chords of Fame also included performances of Ochs songs by folk musicians who <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> including Bob Gibson, Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton, Dave Van Ronk, and Eric Andersen.|$|E
5|$|Rouass' {{involvement}} in the series was first announced in March 2010, with her character name revealed later in May. Because Maya was only a background character, Rouass's role was limited, did not perform any stunts and had time to perform other projects. The actress liked working with Richard Armitage, who played Lucas, as she <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> for some years prior to working on Spooks. The character was met with generally mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> very well.|$|E

5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who <b>knew</b> <b>him.</b> Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Brian Mansfield {{speculated that}} Carey was {{addressing}} Eminem in the lyrics, {{with whom she}} has had a longstanding feud. Carey has reportedly been romantically linked with several male celebrities {{during the course of}} her career, some of which she has openly spoken about and acknowledged, while others she has denied dating. Eminem has claimed on multiple occasions that he dated Carey, but Carey has always firmly denied that she <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> on a romantic level. In 2001, Carey contacted Eminem to discuss the possibility of writing a song together for inclusion on Carey's ninth studio album Charmbracelet (2002), and they reportedly started dating soon after.|$|E
5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Why, no, I don’t <b>know</b> <b>him</b> by that name,’ {{returned}} Flamwell, {{in a low}} tone, {{and with}} an air of immense importance. ‘I have no doubt I <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> though. Is he tall?’ ...|$|R

5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who <b>knew</b> <b>him.</b> His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|McGugin {{took time}} off from {{coaching}} {{to work in the}} mining business during the First World War. On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Peter Kingdom, {{a small-town}} {{solicitor}} whose work revolves around cases {{brought by the}} eclectic and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play out before the hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> (including Peter) assumed that he committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} verses of chapter 3, the Kaushitaki Upanishad asserts that {{to really know}} someone, one must know his soul. Know {{the soul of the}} subject, not just {{superficial}} objects. The structure of its argument is as follows (abridged), One should not desire to understand the speech but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who speaks,One should not desire to understand the smell (described by a person) but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who smells,One should not desire to understand the form (of the person) but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who sees the form,One should not desire to understand the sound (described) but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who hears,One should not desire to understand the food (description) but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who tastes,One should not desire to understand the deed but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who performs the deed,One should not desire to understand pleasure and pain from excitation but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who feels the pleasure and pain,One should not desire to understand the opinion and thinking but should desire to <b>know</b> <b>him</b> who opines and thinks.Because if there were no elements of consciousness, there would be no elements of material beingBecause if there were no elements of material being, there would be no elements of consciousnessBecause any one phenomenon does not come about through the one without the other,Because Prana (life-force) is also the Prajnatman (knowledge-self), is bliss, is not ageing, is immortalThis is my Atman (soul) which one should know, O! this is my Atman which one should know.
