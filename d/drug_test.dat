5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his <b>drug</b> <b>test,</b> even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their <b>drug</b> <b>test.</b> Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the <b>drug</b> <b>test,</b> and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the <b>drug</b> <b>test,</b> and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{economic issues}} posed by illicit <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision {{to adopt a}} <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program is analyzed {{in the context of}} a matching model. Essay one studies the labor market effects of preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> While <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> enhances productive efficiency, many of these welfare gains are dissipated by a labor market externality. <b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> also benefits drug-free workers at the expense of drug users. Low turnover rates, high injury rates, the use of job training, and large workforces all increase the likelihood that the firm adopts a preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program. Essay two considers the use of “for cause” <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in conjunction with preemployment testing. Large firms and firms with high injury rates test with greater intensity than others. As the firm becomes larger, it is relatively more likely to adopt a preemployment testing program than a “for cause” policy. Essay three studies the pattern of adoption of preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> over time. The early adoption of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs is positively related to factors influencing their profitability. ...|$|R
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a <b>drug</b> <b>test</b> for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard <b>drug</b> <b>test</b> for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance furosemide. Furosemide is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive <b>drug</b> <b>test</b> was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed <b>drug</b> <b>test.</b> CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E

50|$|Soon, {{controversy}} over <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> would cause powerlifting to splinter into multiple federations. In 1981, the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA), led by Brother Bennett, {{became the first}} federation {{to break away from}} the USPF, citing the need to implement effective <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in the sport. Meanwhile, the IPF was moving towards adopting <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> at international meets, and requiring member nations to implement <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> at national meets as well. In 1982, <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was introduced to the IPF men's international championship, although the USPF championships that year did not have <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The IPF's push for <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was resisted by some American lifters, and in 1982 Larry Pacifico and Ernie Frantz founded the American Powerlifting Federation (APF), which advertised its categorical opposition to all <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> In 1987 the American Powerlifting Association (APA) and World Powerlifting Alliance were formed by Scott Taylor. The APA and WPA offer both <b>drug</b> <b>tested</b> and non-tested categories in most of their competitions. Ultimately, the USPF failed to conform to IPF demands, and was expelled from the international body in 1997, with the ADFPA, now named USA Powerlifting (USAPL), taking its place.|$|R

40|$|The {{intrusive}} {{nature of}} <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> implicates the concern over a person 2 ̆ 7 s right to privacy. Currently, Congress has proposed legislation which would establish minimum <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> requirements in professional sports. This legislation is {{a reaction to}} suspicions and investigations surrounding Major League Baseball players {{and the use of}} performance enhancing drugs. Federally mandated <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> would raise constitutional issues regarding the players 2 ̆ 7 rights against mandatory <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> These concerns could be avoided if <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies are implemented through a collective bargaining agreement, negotiated and agreed upon between the leagues and their players associations. Thus, as previously asserted, collective bargaining provides the ideal forum for implementing performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports. Part II of this article explores the evolution and nature of professional sports in America and analyzes why the public is demanding that professional athletes be submitted to performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Part III of the article scrutinizes the nature of <b>drug</b> <b>testing,</b> examines the associated onstitutional concerns, and recognizes current <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports. Part IV of the article provides an overview of collective bargaining agreements and the use of arbitration. Then, Part V explains why collective bargaining is the appropriate forum for implementing performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports.

40|$|Ireland {{has become}} one of the first European {{countries}} to legislate for workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> However, little is known about the attitudes of Irish workers towards various aspects of workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programmes. This paper aims to address this matter by presenting the findings of a survey of construction apprentices and their attitudes to workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The results indicate that under some circumstances there is approval for tests; testing with advance warning is preferred to random testing. In addition, the practice of workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in a company would not deter most respondents from applying for a position there. However, attitudes towards most aspects of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> - such as the need for random testing, the right of employers to <b>test</b> for <b>drugs,</b> and infringement of personal rights - are characterised by extreme variability. Higher self-reported frequency of alcohol and drug use, particularly of cannabis, was associated with more negative reactions towards workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The implications of implementing workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programmes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> {{is used in}} {{a number}} of {{contexts}} in Australia and internationally. These uses include providing medical information within drug treatment, helping inform legal decisions, roadside <b>drug</b> <b>testing,</b> and detecting <b>drug</b> use among specific populations, such as in workplaces and schools. •	The aims which <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs are proposed to meet, the rationale for their use, evidence of their effectiveness for meeting their aims, their other potential consequences, and the ethical and legal issues they invoke, all differ by context. •	<b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs impose a burden on those tested, in terms of their infringement on individuals’ bodily and information privacy. For a specific <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program to be acceptable, this burden must be outweighed by relevant factors present in the specific context of use. Such factors may include considerations of public safety or other significant public interests, or the consent of those undergoing testing. •	This paper focuses on <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> as used within drug treatment, among parents in contact with child protection services, in schools, among welfare beneficiaries, and in the workplace. •	With regard to each of these contexts, the paper overviews the rationale for using <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> or implementing a program of <b>drug</b> <b>testing,</b> the coherence of the rationale, the current evidence base for the use of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in that context, and the ethical or legal issues raised. •	Within <b>drug</b> treatment, <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> is primarily used in Australia to support medical decision-making. This is a valid medical usage to ensure that prescribed treatments will be safe and effective for patients. There is, however, a need to ensure that such testing does not outrun its medical use, and is used only to review and improve the individual’s progress in treatment. •	Regarding parental <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> to facilitate child protection decisions, <b>drug</b> <b>tests</b> may provide further information on particular families’ situations. It is important that the use of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in this context is cautiously considered. Where decisions to use <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> are made within particular cases the information they provide should be considered supplementary to other information on the family situation. The possibility of false negatives or false positives needs to be carefully considered and addressed. •	There is little satisfactory evidence to support the use of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in schools, but there are reasons for concern about potential negative effects and high costs, and evidence of other, non-intrusive methods that might better meet the aims of such <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs. There should be a presumption against the use of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs in schools on the currently available evidence-base. •	There is no evidence that <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> welfare beneficiaries will have any positive effects for those individuals or for society, and some evidence indicating such a practice could have high social and economic costs. In addition, there would be serious ethical and legal problems in implementing such a program in Australia. <b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> of welfare beneficiaries ought not be considered. •	The evidence for the effectiveness of workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs to improve workplace safety is limited. There is potential for negative consequences for companies as well as employees, including high economic costs; and some evidence that other measures {{would be more likely to}} improve workplace safety. In addition there are problematic ethical and legal implications surrounding employee privacy. While the ANCD recognises that a stronger rationale and argument for <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> of workers in safety-sensitive positions, or in positions of public trust and authority, can be given, there should be a presumption against a broader introduction of workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> •	<b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs are highly expensive. For example, the cost of implementing <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs in Australian schools has been estimated be up to 355 million. A program of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> welfare beneficiaries which operated for four months in Florida, USA, and discontinued benefits to those who tested positive, cost the state an estimated 118, 140, and ran at a net loss of approximately 45, 000. <b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs are unlikely to have any economic benefits in most contexts. •	Whilst it is understandable why some might presume that <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> is a useful strategy, it is high in cost, may have unintended adverse outcomes, and raises serious ethical and legal issues. Its drawbacks may be addressed, at least in part, if it is clearly demonstrated that <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> effectively meets its aims and reduces risk. At least to date, however, the evidence does not support such a conclusion...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if a <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program could impact or change student drug use at the secondary education level. Secondary purposes were to 1) assess the perceptions of secondary education students toward licit and illicit drugs, drug use, and the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program, and 2) to examine why drug use may continue even after a <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program has been implemented. Data was collected through the use of questionnaires, discussion groups, and one-on-one interviews. Examination of the questionnaire data indicated that student drug use was not substantially deterred by the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program over a three to four month time period. Also, students' perceptions of the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program were mainly that of disagreement. Students commented that they felt the <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policy was implemented to "catch them" using drugs rather than "help them" with a possible drug addiction. One of the main reasons that the <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program did not have a great deterrent effect on student drug use, as suggested by the students, was that the odds were not high enough that they would be selected to be <b>drug</b> <b>tested.</b> In some instances, <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was not proving to be a deterrent to drug use, but rather a deterrent to participation in school activities.
