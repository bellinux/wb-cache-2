5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E

5|$|In November 1938, Blamey was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting.

In 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939. On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.|$|E

5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, {{setting the stage for}} the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Avonmouth {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a self-contained railway which {{ran along the}} River Avon in Bristol, England. The station, which opened in 1865, was adjacent to a pier on the River Severn at Avonmouth. It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} engine shed and water tank. The station was closed in 1902 as the land was required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903. The hotel continued in operation until 1926, when it too was demolished {{to make way for the}} docks. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> white {{settlement}} from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too deep to ford {{for most of the}} year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result {{of not being able to}} sustain themselves in the valley.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Shoghi Effendi {{launched}} a seven-year {{plan for the}} Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946. In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the Ten Year World Crusade. This plan included extremely ambitious goals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of Bahá'í texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bahá'í pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade {{that it would be}} followed by other plans {{under the direction of the}} Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then {{launched a}} nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F {{with less than}} 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had {{caught the attention of}} Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E

When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E

5|$|Katia tracked west-northwestward {{for several}} days, steered by an {{expansive}} mid-level ridge to the cyclone's north. The strong upper-level winds that were affecting the cyclone gradually slackened, allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> a central dense overcast, {{the formation of}} a large curved band in the southern semicircle, and development of a banding eye on microwave imagery. Satellite intensity estimates increased accordingly, prompting the NHC to upgrade Katia to hurricane intensity at 00:00UTC on September1, while the storm was situated about 1,350miles (2,175km) east of the Leeward Islands. Although conditions were forecast to remain conducive for further intensification, water vapor satellite and microwave imagery indicated that mid-level dry air began eroding eyewall convection immediately after the storm's upgrade, and upper-level winds eventually became less favorable as Katia approached a sharp upper-level trough. As a result, the storm maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for almost three days, with only a partial eyewall or banding-eye feature appearing on satellite.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is {{considered}} one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on death metal. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> extreme metal to countries where it had previously been unknown. The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure to pay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> {{the military and the}} air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Great Moravia made room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the Czech or Bohemian state, which {{likewise}} incorporated {{some of the}} Polish lands. The {{founder of}} the Přemyslid dynasty, Prince Bořivoj, was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague. His son and successor Spytihněv was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of East Frankish/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which {{was destined to be}} decisive. Borivoj's grandson Prince Wenceslaus, the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother Boleslaus. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the Vistulan and Lendian tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of Silesia.|$|E
