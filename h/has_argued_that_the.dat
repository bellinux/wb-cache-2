5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pandemic, when {{combined}} with {{the increasing number of}} women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|James Richard Ellis <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if {{she and her father}} were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — {{is bound to}} decrease {{sometime in the future}} as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{scholars}} have always defended {{the value of}} specific parts of the work. Anthony Birley, for instance, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lives up to Septimius Severus {{are based on the}} now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. As a result, his translation of the History for Penguin Books covers only the first half, and was published as Lives of the Later Caesars, Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these {{are not part of the}} original texts, which begin with Hadrian).|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E

The main factors for membership most agreed upon are regular, competitive, free and fair elections, and protection of individual rights and the rule of law.Other progressive thinkers, such as Daniele Archibugi <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same purposes will be better served by a democratic reform of the United Nations.|$|R
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief {{for the loss of}} his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E

5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cause of}} the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not be blamed on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand had fewer civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of the keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany {{as well as the}} miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts {{to reform the}} global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly {{the most important issue}} is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, {{also known as the}} Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped {{by natural selection}} and adapted to our communication needs. He {{is the author of}} seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
