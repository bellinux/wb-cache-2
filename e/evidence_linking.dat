5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> {{the gang}} to {{a spate of}} vehicle thefts along the A1 road, Ross is unable to persuade his superior, Sergeant Pearson (Arthur Rigby), to {{investigate}} the café.

When Pearson learns of Ross' private investigation, he threatens the officer's job, causing tension between Ross and his wife Joan (Patricia Heneghan).|$|E
5|$|Philip Marc Smith (born July 10, 1965 in Willenhall , England) is an English spree killer {{serving a}} life {{sentence}} for the murders of three women in Birmingham. A former fairground worker employed at the Rainbow public house in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> him to the deaths.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a Minnesota {{resident}} named Lyle Christiansen {{watched a}} television {{documentary about the}} Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also summarized the circumstantial <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> Christiansen to the Cooper case.|$|E

5|$|The {{five men}} {{were charged with}} {{terrorism}} aimed at undermining authority on 29 October. The investigation was led by Gagik Jhangiryan, the Chief Military Prosecutor of Armenia, who claimed his team {{was looking for the}} masterminds of the shooting even after the trial had begun. According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan's investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the Deputy Presidential Adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but, by the summer of that year, they were released.

5|$|When Thomas Hunt Morgan began {{experimenting with}} {{breeding}} the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{he was a}} saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> it to chromosomal inheritance. His work also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small effects, such as a change in eye color, and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, mutations served to increase variation within the existing population.|$|E
5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is no hard <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E

5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because her body was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after her body was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism. They eventually find the car, but uncover no <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> it to Watson.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess whether}} school environments can {{adversely}} affect academic performance, we review scientific evidence relating indoor pollutants and thermal conditions, in schools or other indoor environments, to human performance or attendance. We critically review evidence for direct associations between {{these aspects of}} indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and performance or attendance. Secondarily, we summarize, without critique, evidence on indirect connections potentially linking IEQ to performance or attendance. Regarding direct associations, little strongly designed research was available. Persuasive <b>evidence</b> <b>links</b> higher indoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide to reduced school attendance, and suggestive <b>evidence</b> <b>links</b> low ventilation rates to reduced performance. Regarding indirect associations, many studies link indoor dampness and microbiologic pollutants (primarily in homes) to asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections, which in turn have been related to reduced performance and attendance. Also, much <b>evidence</b> <b>links</b> poor IEQ (e. g., low ventilation rate, excess moisture, or formaldehyde) with adverse health effects in children and adults and documents dampness problems and inadequate ventilation as common in schools.

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, there was some {{violence}} and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed Kayumba Nyamwasa, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to Johannesburg, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist Jean-Léonard Rugambage, who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, {{the vice president of the}} Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, was beheaded in Butare. There is no concrete <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> Kagame with the attacks, but it was sufficient for the United Nations to demand an investigation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he belonged}} to a prestigious family, Cofresí was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maravedís in taxes, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>linking</b> him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofresí was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofresí's recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales.|$|E
