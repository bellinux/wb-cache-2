5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> appealed for an en banc {{rehearing}} by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand.

Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior.

He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia.

5|$|The Justice Department {{filed the}} charges on February 15, 2013, and Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013 to {{one count of}} wire and mail fraud in {{connection}} with his misuse of $750,000 of campaign funds. On June 7, 2013, <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence for Jackson. On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns in attempt to conceal the crimes. The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter.

5|$|CT was {{involved}} in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. <b>Federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E
