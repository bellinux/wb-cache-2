Robust designs and <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> interference techniques have recently enabled tooth-by-tooth resolved absorption spectroscopy in a compact and flexible package. In this work, we present both the first mobilization of a <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectrometer in harsh environments and the first broadband, high-resolution investigation of high temperature water vapor lineshapes. The instrument was deployed to {{the basement of a}} 16 MW natural gas turbine facility at CU Boulder to simultaneously measure H 2 O and CO 2 concentrations and gas temperature in the exhaust stream. This revealed errors in the two most common spectroscopic databases used for high temperature studies, HITRAN 2012 and HITEMP 2010. These databases are accurate at room temperature, though their accuracy diminishes at elevated temperatures. We used the <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectrometer at NIST Boulder to compare, for the first time, spectra of pure and air-broadened water at temperatures up to 1000 ⁰C with models generated by both databases. Their data is almost entirely extracted using Voigt lineshape profiles while advanced profiles that fix problems with the Voigt have not been broadly tested at elevated temperatures. We fit the spectra from the above comparison with Voigt, Rautian, and quadratic speed dependent Voigt lineshapes to examine their effect on 232 extracted temperature-scaling exponents. Only the quadratic speed dependent Voigt produced values that validated external computations while only requiring a single exponent to fit each transition up to 1000 ⁰C. We then utilized these fits to generate a new database of spectral parameters to increase high temperature accuracy of spectroscopic measurements. The database contains line centers, linestrengths, self-broadening coefficients, temperature-scaling exponents, and speed dependence parameters for 625 water vapor absorption transitions. Finally, we deployed the mobile spectrometer to Colorado School of the Mines to measure water mole fraction and temperature in the core of an entrained flow gasifier.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{frequency comb}} spectroscopy and, in particular, its extension to the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) wavelength regimes through {{a technique called}} intracavity high harmonic generation (IHHG). By combining the techniques of passive pulse amplification in an enhancement cavity with high harmonic generation, IHHG enables the direct conversion of near-infrared radiation to the VUV/XUV while still maintaining the underlying comb structure. As part of this work, a series of numerical simulations was performed to investigate the plasma that is formed in the IHHG process {{and its implications for}} the resulting VUV comb. It was demonstrated that a fundamental limitation to the performance of IHHG experiments is due to the single-pass ionization phase shift acquired by the pulse circulating in the enhancement cavity. Furthermore, we showed that a static background plasma accumulates between pulses and complicates cavity stabilization. Insights gained from the simulations {{led to the development of}} a novel pump-probe technique using the enhancement cavity that allowed a direct measurement of the intracavity plasma and its decay dynamics in real-time. Because the plasma lifetime plays such a crucial role in the operation of these cavities, it was important to have a method to test ways of reducing it. To build on our initial IHHG results showing record-level powers in the XUV, we implemented a fully phase-coherent <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectrometer consisting of two identical IHHG systems operating in parallel.

We measure long (>  500  m), integrated open path concentrations of atmospheric methane using a <b>dual</b> frequency <b>comb</b> spectrometer and combine measurements with an atmospheric transport model to infer leak locations and strengths using a novel statistical method, the non-zero minimum bootstrap (NZMB). The new statistical method allows us {{to determine whether the}} empirical distribution of possible source strengths for a given location excludes zero. Using this information, we identify leaking source locations (i. e., natural gas wells) through rejection of the null hypothesis that the source is not leaking. The method is tested with a series of synthetic data inversions with varying measurement density and varying levels of model-data mismatch. It is also tested with field observations of 1) a non-leaking source location and 2) a source location where a controlled emission of 2. 1  E- 5  kg s − 1 of methane gas is released {{over a period of several}} hours. This series of synthetic data tests and outdoor field observations using a controlled methane release demonstrate the viability of the approach for the detection and sizing of very small (− 1) leaks of methane across large distances (4  + km 2 in synthetic tests). The field tests demonstrate the ability to attribute small atmospheric enhancements of 18  ppb to the emitting source location against a background of combined atmospheric (e. g., background methane variability) and measurement uncertainty of 6  ppb (1 -sigma), when measurements are averaged over 2 minutes. The results of the synthetic and field data testing show that the new observing system and statistical approach greatly decreases the incidence of false alarms (that is, wrongly identifying a well site to be leaking) compared with the same tests that don’t use the NZMB approach, and therefore offers increased leak detection and sizing capabilities...|$|R

Here we show how to synthesize the absolute frequency of a lightwave signal, using integrated photonics to implement lasers, system interconnects, and nonlinear frequency comb generation. The laser frequency output of our synthesizer is programmed by a microwave clock across 4 THz near 1550 nm with 1 Hz resolution and traceability to the SI second. This is accomplished with a heterogeneously integrated III/V-Si tunable laser, which is guided by <b>dual</b> dissipative-Kerr-soliton frequency <b>combs</b> fabricated on silicon chips. Through out-of-loop measurements of the phase-coherent, microwave-to-optical link, we verify that the fractional-frequency instability of the integrated photonics synthesizer matches the $ 7. 0 * 10 ^{- 13 }$ reference-clock instability for a 1 second acquisition, and constrain any synthesis error to $ 7. 7 * 10 ^{- 15 }$ while stepping the synthesizer across the telecommunication C band. Any application of an optical frequency source would be enabled by the precision optical synthesis presented here. Building on the ubiquitous capability in the microwave domain, our results demonstrate a first path to synthesis with integrated photonics, leveraging low-cost, low-power, and compact features that will be critical for its widespread use.

40|$|Octave-spanning, self-referenced {{frequency}} combs are applied in diverse fields ranging from precision metrology to astrophysical spectrometer calibration. In the past decade, Kerr frequency comb generators {{have emerged as}} alternative scheme offering chip-scale integration, high repetition rate and bandwidths that are only limited by group velocity dispersion. The recent observation of Kerr {{frequency combs}} operating in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the means for fully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered spectral envelope. Here, by carefully optimizing the photonic Damascene fabrication process, and dispersion engineering of Si_ 3 N_ 4 microresonators with 1 THz free spectral range, we achieve bandwidths exceeding one octave at low powers (O(100 mW)) for pump lasers residing in the telecom C-band (1. 55 μ m), {{as well as for}} the first time in the O-band (1. 3 μ m). Equally important, we find that for THz repetition rate comb states, conventional criteria applied to identify DKS comb states fail. Investigating the coherence of generated, octave-spanning Kerr comb states we unambiguously identify DKS states using a response measurement. This allows to demonstrate octave-spanning DKS comb states at both pump laser wavelengths of 1. 3 μ m and 1. 55 μ m including the broadest DKS state generated to date, spanning more than 200 THz of optical bandwidth. Octave spanning DKS frequency combs can form essential building blocks for metrology or spectroscopy, and their operation at 1. 3 μ m enables applications in life sciences such as Kerr comb based optical coherence tomography or <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> coherent antistokes Raman scattering...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators provides, on the applied side, compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs {{that have already}} been applied in coherent communications, <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectroscopy and metrology. On a fundamental level, it enables the study of soliton physics in driven nonlinear cavities. Microresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode interactions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as "avoided mode crossings". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but can also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e. g. the formation of dispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing temporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied, but is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the discovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs within a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative solitons are expected. We demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon in two microresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic chip-based silicon nitride microresonators), and theoretically describe the dynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We demonstrate experimentally that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange between the soliton and another optical mode family. We further show that inter-mode interactions can be modeled by a response function acting on dissipative solitons. The {{observation of}} breathing dynamics in the conventionally stable soliton regime is critical to applications, ranging from low-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis to spectroscopy. On a fundamental level, our results provide new understandings of the rich dissipative soliton dynamics in multimode nonlinear cavities...|$|E
40|$|Recently, on-chip comb {{generation}} methods {{based on}} nonlinear optical modulation in ultrahigh quality factor monolithic micro-resonators have been demonstrated. In these methods, two pump photons are transformed into sideband photons in a {{four wave mixing}} process mediated by the Kerr nonlinearity. The essential advantages of these methods are simplicity, small size, very high repetition rates and sometimes CMOS compatibility. We investigate line-by-line pulse shaping of such combs generated in silicon nitride ring resonators. We demonstrate a simple example of optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) from Kerr comb. We observe two distinct paths to comb formation which exhibit strikingly different time domain behaviors. For combs formed as a cascade of sidebands spaced by a single free spectral range (FSR) that spread from the pump, {{we are able to}} compress to nearly bandwidth limited pulses. This indicates high coherence across the spectra and provides new data on the high passive stability of the spectral phase. For combs where the initial sidebands are spaced by multiple FSRs which then fill in to give combs with single FSR spacing, the time domain data reveal partially coherent behavior. We also investigate the behaviors of a few sub-families of the partially coherent combs selected by a pulse shaper. We observe different coherence properties for different groups of comb lines. Furthermore we will discuss an ultrafast characterization techniques called <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> electric eld cross correlation. This linear technique will provide both low optical power and broader bandwidth capability for full time domain characterization of OAWG from Kerr comb. ...|$|E

WashburnOptical {{frequency}} combs produced by mode-locked fiber lasers are useful tools for high precision frequency metrology and molecular spectroscopy in a robust and portable format. We have specifically investigated erbium doped fiber mode-locked lasers that use single-walled carbon nanotubes as a saturable absorber. We have, {{for the first}} time, developed and phase- stabilized a carbon nanotube fiber laser (CNFL) frequency comb. The carbon nanotube saturable absorber, which was fabricated using an optically driven deposition method, permits a high repetition frequency (> 150 MHz) since an optical nonlinearity of fibers is not used for mode-locking. The CNFL comb combined with a parabolic pulse erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) has shown a compact, robust, and cost-effective supercontinuum source. The amplified pulse from the parabolic pulse EDFA was compressed with a hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber, which produced a wave-breaking-free pulse with an all-fiber set-up. The stabilized comb has demonstrated a fractional instability of 1. 2 × 10 [superscript]- 11 at 1 sec averaging time, the reference-limited instability. We have performed optical frequency metrology with the CNFL comb and have measured an optical frequency, P(13) which is a molecular overtone transition of C 2 H 2. The measured frequency has shown a good agreement with the known value within an uncertainty of 10 kHz. In order to extend {{the application of the}} CNFL comb such as multi-heterodyne <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectroscopy, we have investigated the noise of the CNFL comb and particularly, the broad carrier envelope offset frequency (f[subscript] 0) linewidth of the CNFL comb. The primary noise source is shown to be white amplitude noise on the oscillator pump laser combined with the sensitivity of the mode-locked laser to pump power fluctuations. The control bandwidth of f[subscipt] 0 was limited by the response dynamics of the CNFL comb. The significant reduction of comb noise has been observed by implementing a phase-lead compensation to extend control bandwidth of the comb and by reducing the pump relative intensity noise simultaneously. Therefore the f[subscipt] 0 linewidth has been narrower from 850 kHz to 220 kHz. The integrated phase noise for the f[subscipt] 0 lock is 1. 6 radians from 100 Hz to 102 kHz...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, quantum cascade lasers {{have emerged}} as mature {{semiconductor}} sources {{of light in the}} terahertz range, the frequency range spanning 1 to 10 THz. Though technological development has pushed their operating temperatures up to 200 Kelvin and their power levels up to Watt-level, they have remained unsuitable for many applications {{as a result of their}} narrow spectral coverage. In particular, spectroscopic and tomographic applications require sources that are both powerful and broadband. Having said that, there is no fundamental reason why quantum cascade lasers should be restricted to narrowband outputs. In fact, they possess gain spectra that are intrinsically broad, and beyond that can even be tailored to cover an octave-spanning range. This thesis explores the development of broadband sources of terahertz radiation based on quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). The chief way this is done is through the development of compact frequency combs based on THz QCLs, which are able to continuously generate milliwatt levels of terahertz power covering a fractional bandwidth of 14 % of their center frequency. These devices operate on principles similar to microresonator-based frequency combs, and make use of the quantum cascade laser's fundamentally large nonlinearity to phase-lock the cavity modes. These devices will enable the development of ultra-compact <b>dual</b> <b>comb</b> spectrometers based on QCLs, and will potentially even act as complete terahertz spectrometers on a chip. This thesis also uses broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to analyze the behavior of THz QCLs. By using QCLs as photoconductive switches, the usual limitations imposed by optical coupling are circumvented, and properties of the laser previously inaccessible can be directly observed. These properties include the gain and absorption of the laser gain medium, the populations of the laser's subbands, and properties of the waveguide like its loss and dispersion. Knowledge of these properties were used to guide frequency comb design, and were also used to inform simulations for designing better lasers. by David Patrick Burghoff. Thesis: Ph.
