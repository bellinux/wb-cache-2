If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E

2500|$|The Catalan {{government}} announced a referendum, {{to be held}} in November 2014, on the question of statehood. The referendum was to ask two questions: [...] "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" [...] and (<b>if</b> <b>yes)</b> [...] "Do you want this State to be independent?" [...] The Spanish government referred the proposed referendum to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled it unconstitutional. The Catalan government then changed it from a binding referendum to a non-binding [...] "consultation". Despite the Spanish court also banning the non-binding vote, the Catalan self-determination referendum went ahead on 9 November 2014. The result was an 81% vote for [...] "yes-yes", with a turnout of 42%. Mas called another election for September 2015, which he said would be a plebiscite on independence. Pro-independence parties fell just short of a majority of votes in the September election, although they won a majority of seats. The new parliament passed a resolution declaring the start of the independence process in November 2015, and the following year, new president Carles Puigdemont announced a binding referendum on independence. Although deemed illegal by the Spanish government and Constitutional Court, the referendum was held on 1 October 2017. In a vote where the anti-independence parties called for non-participation, results showed a 90% vote in favour of independence, with a turnout of 43%.|$|E

2500|$|Mas and ERC leader Oriol Junqueras {{signed an}} {{agreement}} by which the ERC would support the CiU on sovereignty issues while on other matters it might oppose it. The two leaders drafted the Declaration of Sovereignty and of the Right to Decide of the Catalan People, which {{was adopted by the}} parliament at its first sitting in January 2013. [...] The declaration stated that [...] "the Catalan people have, for reasons of democratic legitimacy, the nature of a sovereign political and legal subject", and that the people had the right to decide their own political future. The Spanish government referred the declaration to the Spanish Constitutional Court, which ruled in March 2014 that the declaration of sovereignty was unconstitutional; it did, however, allow that there existed a right to decide. On 11 September 2013, an estimated 1.6 million demonstrators formed a human chain, the Catalan Way, from the French border to the regional border with Valencia. The following month, the CiU, the ERC, the ICV-EUiA and Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (CUP) agreed to hold the independence referendum on 9 November 2014, and that it would ask two questions: [...] "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" [...] and (<b>if</b> <b>yes)</b> [...] "Do you want this State to be independent?". A further mass demonstration, the Catalan Way 2014, took place on 11 September 2014, when protesters wearing the Catalan colours of yellow and red filled two of Barcelona’s avenues to form a giant [...] "V", to call for a vote. Following the Constitutional Court’s ruling, the Catalan government changed the vote to a [...] "process of citizen participation" [...] and announced that it would be supervised by volunteers. The Spanish government again appealed to the Constitutional Court, which suspended the process pending the appeal, but the vote went ahead. The result was an 81% vote for yes-yes, but the turnout was only 42%, which could be seen as a majority opposed to both independence and the referendum. Criminal charges were subsequently preferred against Mas and others for defying the court order.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Los Angeles Times, Steve Pond {{believed}} the album succeeds because the band had [...] "lowered rather than raised its sights. By {{going back to}} basics {{rather than trying to}} top its previous 'extravaganzas', Yes has produced its most appealing collection" [...] since Close to the Edge (1972). He praised the [...] "refreshing energy" [...] the album brings, but noted their [...] "kitchen-sink approach to song-writing, throwing everything into a composition but sometimes failing to smoothly integrate the disparate elements". Doug Graves, in The Daily Tar Heel, welcome the band's return to more concise music with an album that is not as [...] "grandiose and overproduced" [...] as their previous two, and resembles the sound of The Yes Album and Fragile. He thought Wakeman plays his keyboard arrangements [...] "with some taste" [...] and praised Anderson's return to more abstract lyrics [...] "rather than preachy". As a result, the band [...] "made itself interesting again". The Independent published a more positive review by Tim Grobaty, who thought the album was the group's most accessible since Fragile and contains the best line-up. However, he deemed [...] "Parallels" [...] the [...] "most boring and incoherent" [...] track on the album, but the rest are [...] "light and entertaining". Grobaty rates the title track and [...] "Turn of the Century" [...] as [...] "excellent". Tony Ciarochi in Fairbanks Daily News-Miner wondered <b>if</b> <b>Yes</b> could return to better form after the poor Relayer, and believed they did, ranking the album as one of the band's better works. [...] "Turn of the Century" [...] was an [...] "outstanding ballad" [...] and [...] "strangely beautiful", but is [...] "unnecessarily long" [...] which does become monotonous. Ciarochi picked out [...] "Going for the One" [...] and [...] "Wonderous Stories" [...] as standout tracks, though [...] "Awaken" [...] a mixture of good and tedious sections. A review from Chris Cobb for The Ottawa Journal thought the album is [...] "typically ponderous and riddled with complexity" [...] with vague lyrics. Cobb thought [...] "Awaken ... stretches the band to the limits of its imagination" [...] and contains [...] "beautiful" [...] organ playing from Wakeman, and concludes the album is at times too self-indulgent coupled with its abstract lyrics and meandering music [...] "more than it should".|$|E
