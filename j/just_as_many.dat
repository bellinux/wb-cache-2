5|$|The localists' main stronghold was in Berlin, {{although}} localist unions {{existed in}} the rest of the Empire as well. Masons, carpenters, and some metal-working professions—especially those requiring a higher degree of qualification like coppersmiths or gold and silver workers—were represented in large numbers. By 1891, there were at least 20,000 metal workers in localist trade unions, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as in the centralized German Metal Workers' Union.|$|E
5|$|Music and {{politics}} have been intertwined for centuries in Italy. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> {{works of art}} in the Italian Renaissance were commissioned by royalty and the Roman Catholic Church, much music was likewise composed on the basis of such commissions—incidental court music, music for coronations, for the birth of a royal heir, royal marches, and other occasions. Composers who strayed ran certain risks. Among the best known of such cases was the Neapolitan composer Domenico Cimarosa, who composed the Republican hymn for the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. When the republic fell, he was tried for treason along with other revolutionaries. Cimarosa was not executed by the restored monarchy, but he was exiled.|$|E
5|$|The 1892 {{regular season}} {{was a success}} for Young, who led the National League in wins (36), ERA (1.93), and shutouts (9). <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> {{contemporary}} Minor League Baseball leagues operate today, the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season. The Boston Beaneaters won the first-half title, and the Spiders won the second-half title, with a best-of-nine series determining the league champion. Despite the Spiders' second half run, the Beaneaters swept the series, five games to none. Young pitched three complete games in the series, but lost two decisions. He also threw a complete game shutout, but the game ended in a 00 tie.|$|E

5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E

The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals.

Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.|$|E
25|$|This also {{explains}} why a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage {{with the same}} APR would have different monthly payments and a different total amount of interest paid. There are many more periods over which to spread the principal, which makes the payment smaller, but there are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> periods over which to charge interest at the same rate, which makes {{the total amount of}} interest paid much greater. For example, $100,000 mortgaged (without fees, since they add into the calculation in a different way) over 15 years costs a total of $193,429.80 (interest is 93.430% of principal), but over 30 years, costs a total of $315,925.20 (interest is 215.925% of principal).|$|E

Conversely, however, two Northamptonshire batsmen batting at 4 and 5 perished for ducks to Richard Johnson. Somerset replied well, though, with 53 from opener Matthew Wood, but rash strokes gave wickets around everywhere as Somerset made 356 – admittedly only 52 behind.

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Little Bighorn, half of the 7th Cavalry's {{companies}} had just returned from 18 months of constabulary duty in the Deep South, having been recalled to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reassemble the regiment for the campaign. About 20 percent of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained, and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from Ireland, England and Germany, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> of the veteran troopers had been before their enlistments. Archaeological evidence suggests that many of these troopers were malnourished and in poor physical condition, despite being the best-equipped and supplied regiment in the Army.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power is}} more {{predictable}} than wind power and less variable – {{while there is}} never any solar power available during the night, {{and there is a}} reduction in winter, the only unknown factors in predicting solar output each day is cloud cover, frost and snow. Many days in a row in some locations are relatively cloud free, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> days in a row in either the same or other locations are overcast – leading to relatively high predictability. Wind comes from the uneven heating of the earth's surface, and can provide about 1% of the potential energy that is available from solar power. 86,000 TW of solar energy reaches the surface of the world vs. 870 TW in all of the world's winds. Total world demand is roughly 12 TW, many times less than the amount that could be generated from potential wind and solar resources. From 40 to 85 TW could be provided from wind and about 580 TW from solar.|$|E
25|$|Although not the same, a yaoi {{construct}} {{similar to}} seme and uke {{is the concept}} of tachi and neko. This archetypal pairing is referenced more often in older yaoi volumes - in modern yaoi, this pairing is often seen as already encompassed by seme and uke or simply unnecessary to address. The tachi partner is conceptualized as the member of the relationship who pursues the more passive partner, the latter of whom {{is referred to as the}} neko. Seme and uke is similar but not identical to tachi and neko because the former refers primarily to sexual roles, whereas the latter describes personality. Although seme and uke roles are already used in some manga to describe which member of the relationship is more dominant and which member is more passive, there are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> manga novels which subtly or overtly differentiate between the two.
