40|$|Property {{offences}} {{have been}} declining in New South Wales, but one crime which has bucked {{this trend is}} fraud. Abstract Aim: 1) To provide {{an understanding of the}} nature of fraud incidents recorded by NSW Police. 2) To find out which fraud types are contributing to the increase in recorded fraud. Method: This study involved the review of 1, 000 narrative descriptions of fraud incidents reported to or detected by NSW Police. Where possible we gathered information about the type of fraudulent behaviour, modus operandi, cost and whether a suspect was apprehended. Half the fraud events sampled occurred in the 12 months to September 2009 and half in the 12 months to September 2013. Results: The most common types of fraud reported to police were card fraud (35 % of incidents), fuel <b>drive-offs</b> (30 %), identity theft (5 %), embezzlement (4 %) and cheque fraud (3 %). Increases in card fraud and fuel drive offs appear to account for the bulk of the increase in fraud over the past five years. Incident costs recorded by police suggest that in 2013 incidents of fraud recorded by police cost more than $ 200 million. The average cost of fraud by incident type ranged from just $ 62 per incident for fuel <b>drive-offs</b> to more than $ 35, 000 per incident for embezzlement. Conclusion: Fraud is a growing problem and will likely continue to rise with new technologies and payment options. This study found that the fraud types with the highest recorded prevalence are quite different to those which have the greatest overall cost implication...|$|R
40|$|Faults in {{position}} reference systems and vessel sensors pose a serious hazard during dynamic positioning, and vessel <b>drive-offs</b> because of erroneous data may have dire consequences. The classification society standards require triple redundancy in heading and position reference systems, but common mode failures and operational limitations {{could put the}} safety promised by the redundancy at risk. In this paper we present a way to detect and isolate faults in the aforementioned systems, using nonlinear observers and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Employing IMU acceleration and gyro data in an integration filter, and comparing estimation error outputs from multiple observers in parallel proves {{to be a viable}} method for fault detection and isolation. This exploits the possibility of using IMUs as another, independent position reference system or sensor on board a vessel. Preprint version. © IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies of}} {{convenience}} store crime {{have focused on}} robberies, but gasoline thefts are a troublesome and often overlooked public policy problem that drain valuable police resources. An analysis of calls for service from 38 convenience stores in Austin, TX reveals that gasoline drive-qffs account for 48 % of all convenience store calls. This paper ties the environmental characteristics and business practices of convenience stores to reported gasoline drive-qffs. The findings suggest that removing signs from windows, installing brighter lights and instituting a pay-first policy can deter such crimes. Over just a two-year period, an Austin, TX convenience store was criminally victimized not once, not twice, but 385 times (Austin Police Department. 1090). Ninety percent of these victimizations were gasoline <b>drive-offs</b> (offenders filling their tanks with gas and driving off without paying); the others consisted of shoplifting, disturbances and acts of criminal mischief. Why is this store so attractive to criminals—particularly those who steal gas? It {{could be that the}} store is located in a high-crime neighborhood. Or perhaps the clerks are fearful of crime and are therefore vulnerable to victimization. And there is always the possibility that the store has certain business practices that encourage particular crimes. Patrol officers spend thousands of hours responding to convenience store incidents. In the year 1990 alone, Austin convenience stores reported over 6. 000 thefts (Austin Police Department. 1990). The strain on patrol officers * time in responding to convenience store calls for service translates into higher costs for police services as cities are pressured to hire mor...|$|R

50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (drive-on, <b>drive-off)</b> launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, hydraulic oil tank for the front axle, hydraulic pumps, cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the dead-man control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground speed which corresponds to engine speed and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|E

40|$|Collisions between FPSO and shuttle tanker {{in tandem}} {{offloading}} operation {{have caused a}} growing concern in the North Sea. Several recent contact incidents between FPSO/FSU and shuttle tanker have clearly demonstrated a high likelihood of contact between vessels in tandem offloading. The large masses involved, i. e. the high potential impact energy, make the collision risk large. Traditional ship/platform collision frequency modeling may not be applicable in the tandem offloading context. Moreover, offshore quantitative risk analyses generally focus more on technical aspects, little on human and organizational aspects. This leads to a hardware-dominated risk reduction approach, {{and it has been}} proved not to be effective to mitigate risks involved in complex marine operations in general. Frequency modeling of collision between FPSO and shuttle tanker in offloading operation is carried out in this study. The collision frequency model is structured in two stages, i. e. the initiating stage and the recovery stage, where the former involves an uncontrolled forward movement of tanker, and the latter involves the recovery actions initiated from tanker and FPSO to avoid the collision. In the initiating stage, this study focuses on tanker <b>drive-off</b> forward scenarios. Macroscopically, the frequency of tanker <b>drive-off</b> ahead during offshore loading and specifically during tandem offloading is portrayed by statistical data from an earlier study, recent SYNERGI incident data, and expert judgments made by tanker DP operators. Relatively high frequency values of tanker <b>drive-off</b> in tandem offloading are found. Microscopically, the tanker <b>drive-off</b> ahead scenario is investigated by examining 9 such events in tandem offloading based on investigation reports, interviews and discussions with individuals who directly or indirectly were involved. Findings reveal that in order to effectively reduce tanker <b>drive-off</b> in tandem offloading, efforts should be targeted on minimizing those failure prone situations, i. e. the excessive relative motions (termed as surging and yawing) between FPSO and tanker. A simulation-based study is carried out to quantitatively assess and effectively minimize the occurrence of excessive surging and yawing events. Horizontal motions of FPSO and tanker in tandem configuration are simulated via a state-of-the-art time-domain simulation code SIMO. Findings demonstrate that excessive surging and yawing events can be effectively minimized via measures such as minimizing FPSO surge and yaw motions in offloading, coordinating mean heading between FPSO and tanker, and using the dedicated DP software with the tandem loading function on tanker. Ultimately, these measures may provide a sound operational environment where the possibility of tanker <b>drive-off</b> can be minimized. In the recovery stage, this study is focused on the recovery action initiated by the tanker DP operator. Possible recovery actions are identified and evaluated. Based on calibrated tanker motion simulations, the allowable time for DP operator to initiate recovery action, so that tanker can be stopped within a separation distance, e. g. 80 m to FPSO, is found to be critically short. A 3 -stage information-decision-execution model is generalized to model the DP operator’s information processing stages regarding action initiation when in a <b>drive-off</b> scenario. Based on this human information-processing model, expert judgment by simulator trainer and questionnaire survey among shuttle tanker captains and DP officers are conducted, reasonable estimates of the time needed for action initiation are obtained. The estimates are found to be convergent to the facts in the incidents. Findings suggest that tanker DP operators in general need more time to initiate recovery action than the allowable time window, i. e. recovery failure is likely due to lack of reaction time. Two principal recommendations are proposed to reduce the recovery failure probability, i. e. to provide a longer time window for the operator to initiate recovery action, and/or to provide various kinds of assistance to the operator to reduce the recovery action initiation time. To increase the time window, a promising measure is to substantially increase the separation distance between FPSO and tanker, e. g. from 80 m to 150 m. The feasibility of this measure is discussed from a number of perspectives. Recovery improvement gains are assessed. The key question concerning implementation is to know how much separation distance should be configured in the operation. This has to be based on considerations of both human operators’ need for reaction time, and tanker <b>drive-off</b> behavior. Parametric tanker <b>drive-off</b> motion simulations are carried out in which human action at various times are imposed. The necessary distance values to stop the tanker are then obtained, and ideally these should correspond to the separation distance values between FPSO and tanker in tandem offloading. These findings provide decision-making support to select an optimum field configuration for FPSO-tanker tandem offloading, which may inherently minimize the collision risk. Effective reduction of reaction time can be achieved by early detection and/or quick decision-making. This is based on the operator information-processing model generalized earlier in this study. Measures to improve early detection are identified. Discussions are guided by the human signal detection theory, and supported by the operational facts of alarm and non-alarm signals in the operation. Measures to effectively reduce the operator’s time involved in diagnosis and situation awareness are also identified. They are theoretically built on the generic human decision-making theory, and specifically designed for <b>drive-off</b> intervention based on the facts collected via a questionnaire survey among shuttle tanker captains and DP officers. These findings illuminate a broad area in the human factor perspective, i. e. training, procedure, crew resource management, human-machine interface, and automation support, where measures to reduce operator reaction time should be targeted. These measures may directly reduce the FPSO-tanker collision risk in tandem offloading. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The definitive version is available online at: www. tandfonline. comThe lunge is regularly used in badminton and is recognized for the high physical demands it places on the lower limbs. Despite its common occurrence, little information is available on the biomechanics of lunging in the singles game. A video-based pilot study confirmed the relatively high frequency of lunging, ~ 15 % of all movements, in competitive singles games. The biomechanics and performance characteristics of three badminton-specific lunge tasks (kick, step-in, and hop lunge) were investigated in the laboratory with nine experienced male badminton players. Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were collected and lower limb joint kinetics calculated using an inverse dynamics approach. The step-in lunge was characterized by significantly lower mean horizontal reaction force at <b>drive-off</b> and lower mean peak hip joint power than the kick lunge. The hop lunge resulted in significantly larger mean reaction forces during loading and <b>drive-off</b> phases, as well as significantly larger mean peak ankle joint moments and knee and ankle joint powers than the kick or step-in lunges. These findings indicate that, within the setting of this investigation, the step-in lunge may be beneficial for reducing the muscular demands of lunge recovery and that the hop lunge allows for higher positive power output, thereby presenting an efficient lunging method...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to make use of the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) method for analysis of marine accidents in relation to Dynamic Positioning incidents (DP-incidents), and try to improve upon the model of earlier works. BBN has become an accepted method in the last two decades for analyzing conditional probabilities and incidents, especially where extensive data may be lacking. The report will explain the methodology used in sensitivity analysis of the causal factors, and analyze DP accident scenarios. Data is provided by IMCA Incidents reports from the years 2000 to 2007, previously analyzed and sorted by Global Maritime. The computer software, GeNIe 2. 0, was used to build a BBN to visualize the full system and sub-systems, along with dependencies among causal factors and calculate probabilities. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to see which causal factors had most influence on the different terminal events. This analysis showed that human errors had a high occurrence and impact on the terminal events. Poor procedures was the causal factor that occurred most often (25 % of all incidents), and most often lead to a loss of position. Amongst the preliminary causes, poor procedures had the highest improvement potential in terms of every terminal event. Operator error was another human error that proved to have a high improvement potential. It occurred in 16 % of the incidents as a main cause, and in 6 % as a preliminary cause, but the improvement potential was higher for this cause than all the latent human errors combined. Amongst the components, DP-software had the highest improvement potential in terms of <b>drive-off,</b> major and minor loss of position, (LOP 1 and LOP 2), and second highest in terms of uncertain (<b>drive-off</b> or drift-off). In terms of drift-off, environmental main causes such as wind and current proved to have the highest improvement potential, but in order to actually improve such causes, focus should be made on the human preliminary causes, along with thrusters and power generation...|$|E
40|$|This project {{sought to}} {{identify}} the causal factors related to loss of position incidents for dynamically positioned vessels, and to explore {{the possibility of using}} a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to model the identified factors. The causal factors behind loss of position incidents were iand sorted by the author through a study of the DP (Dynamic Positioning) system, and analysis of loss of position incidents reported to the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) register. One or more of three categories were found to be present in more than 90 % of all loss of position incidents; propulsion failures, position reference failures and human factors. According to IMCA definition, no loss of position actually has to occur for a scenario to be defined as a loss of position incident. This discovery led to the identification of four terminal events (end of the causal chain) of such incidents; <b>drive-off,</b> drift-off, operation abort and time loss. Due to limitations in the available data, about one third of all incidents resulted in an unknown terminal event. <b>Drive-off</b> occurred in 11 % of the incidents and drift-off in 17 %. Consequently, Loss of Position (LOP), as a minimum occurred in 28 % of all incidents reported to IMCA from 2008 to 2010. Dependencies in causal factors such as system failures, and their resulting terminal events were presented. For modelling of such dependencies a Bayesian Belief Network analysis were utilized. The Bayesian Belief Network was constructed upon the same categories of failure as defined through the data sorting. The process of creating the BBN involved establishing causal flowcharts and use of the GeNIe software package. The main findings regarding the method of Bayesian Belief Network analysis, is that this method enabled the combination of qualitative knowledge (beliefs), with data frequencies in a systematic way. Additionally a Bayesian Belief Network allows for a graphical and intuitive presentation of modelled systems, with the possibility of quick and easy sensitivity analysis. However the method has some limitations. In order to be understandable for the reader, the network must be limited in the number of connections between nodes, which may lead to loss of information, especially in large networks. </p...|$|E

This thesis dealt with development of a fault-tolerant nonlinear observer for integration of INS and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Furthermore, the observer was applied for dynamic positioning, by developing a simulator to obtain vessel motion and sensor readings. The main focus were on GNSS errors and faults. Based on this were methods used to detect and handle outlier detection, sensor freeze, high variance of GNSS sensors and GNSS bias. Furthermore, a novel GNSS drift detection algorithm, applicable for marine vessel, was developed. Moreover, senor voting and sensor weighting {{was carried out by}} developing a voting algorithm. Also a model-based observer was utilized to provide redundant acceleration information to the INS. The chosen INS/GNSS observer proved to be a good basis for the fault-tolerant additions.

40|$|Following {{a series}} of {{collisions}} and near-misses, involving shuttle tanker and FPSO performing tandem offloading operations in the North Sea, extensive effort was put {{to address the issue}} in the early 2000 &# 146;s. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the current situation for risks relating to collisions between DP shuttle tanker and FPSO during tandem offloading operations in the North Sea. The main research question was &# 145;what major research has been performed on the collision risk between DP shuttle tanker and FPSO during tandem offloading in the North Sea, and what is the current situation of the collision risk, anno mid 2014 ?&# 146; An extensive literature study was performed, featuring background material concerning FPSOs, shuttle tankers, and tandem offloading operations. The collision risk was further investigated by using both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis methods. The qualitative risk analysis included an assessment of human, organisational, and technical factors&# 146; influence in tandem offloading operations. Based on the aforementioned, a simple analysis of barriers against collision in a <b>drive-off</b> scenario was performed using the bow-tie method. The quantitative risk analysis included a statistical data analysis of reported incidents involving DP shuttle tankers performing tandem offloading from FPSOs on the UK and Norwegian continental shelves (UKCS & NCS), covering the time period from 1995 - 2013. The results from the risk analysis were further applied to propose possible risk mitigation measures for tandem offloading operations between DP shuttle tanker and FPSO. Research relating to the collision risk in FPSO-shuttle tanker offloading operations, performed post the conclusion of the JIP project &# 145;Operational Safety of FPSOs&# 146;, is found to be mainly concerned with further work regarding the risk elements that were identified in the JIP project and the PhD thesis of Dr. Ing. Haibo Chen, as well as providing updated statistics on incidents and risk levels. Results from this thesis&# 146; risk analysis revealed a decrease in the frequency (both absolute and per offloading) of incidents and collisions, during FPSO-shuttle tanker offloading operations on the UKCS & NCS, when comparing 1995 - 2003 versus 2004 - 2013. For the UKCS & NCS aggregated, per mid- 2014, the collision frequency estimated to lie in the range of 4. 5 E- 04 to 8. 0 E- 04 per offloading, and the <b>drive-off</b> frequency is estimated to lie in the range of 9. 0 E- 04 to 2. 3 E- 03 per offloading. Several measures for reducing the collision frequency have been proposed and discussed in this thesis. The measures addresses DPO competence level, time available for initiating recovery action, cooperation between shuttle tanker and FPSO, and alternative field configurations. The collision frequency can be significantly reduced by applying direct offloading configuration instead of tandem offloading configuration. However, there are technical and operational issues that have to be resolved, before applying such a configuration to ship-shaped FPSO...|$|E

40|$|Older cyclists {{remain at}} high risk of {{sustaining}} an injury after a fall with their bicycle. A growing awareness for the need and possibilities to support safety of older cyclists has been leading to bicycle design ideas. However, the effectiveness and acceptance of such designs has not been studied yet. This study aims to analyse the effect of 3 support systems: an automatic adjustable saddle height, optimised frame and wheel geometry and <b>drive-off</b> assistance. The support systems are integrated on the SOFIE bicycle, a prototype bicycle designed to support older cyclists during (dis-) mounting and at lower cycling speeds. Nine older cyclists (65 – 80 years) were asked to cycle on a ‘normal’ and on the ‘SOFIE’ bicycle. They cycled on a parking lot to avoid interaction with traffic. The following tasks were analysed: cycling at comfortable and low speed avoiding an obstacle and (dis-) mounting the bicycle. Bicycle and cyclist motions were recorded with 10 Inertial Measurement Units and by 2 video cameras. FUSION software (LABVIEW) was used to assess kinematic parameters. First, a subjective analysis of the different cycling tasks was made, supported by video analysis. Second, differences in cyclist and bicycle kinematic parameters between the normal and SOFIE bicycle were studied for the various cycling tasks. The SOFIE bicycle was experienced as a ‘supportive’ and comfortable bicycle and objectively performed ‘safer’ on various cycling tasks. For example: The optimised frame geometry with low step-in enabled a faster (dis-) mounting time and less sternum roll angle and angular acceleration. The adjustable saddle height enabled the participants to keep both feet on the ground till they started cycling with the ‘drive-off’ support. The latter reduces steering activity: maximum steer angle and angular acceleration. During sudden obstacle avoidance, less upper body and thigh accelerations are recorded. In conclusion, the SOFIE bicycle was able to support older cyclists during various cycling tasks and may reduce fall risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} a drilling riser exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions at different water depths. The aim is to develop an advisory system for vessel position based on the riser response and also to better predict the transition from operation to a potential disconnect. The advisory system will make use of watch circles which define the limits for normal operation, halt in operation and a possible disconnect. As the most accessible oil reservoirs are exploited, {{there is a need}} for drilling operations at ever greater water depths and in harsher environments. The riser, and its interactions with the vessel and the blow-out preventer (BOP), is a crucial element in a drilling operation. In order to ensure a safe and productive operation, the riser top and bottom angles must be within acceptable limits. For excessive angles, a disconnect from the well is carried out. This will imply a major loss of income, and it is therefore highly undesirable to disconnect when not necessary. However, the consequences of not disconnecting when necessary are even more severe. The riser is exposed to currents, waves and vessel motions which cause it to deflect. The effect from these influences must be investigated in order to predict the riser angles in various conditions and thereby develop watch circles taking these angles into account. The riser has been modeled and analyzed in RIFLEX, a software program developed at MARINTEK for static and dynamic analysis of slender marine structures. In order to investigate the response in both shallow and deep waters, water depths of 300 and 2000 [m] have been applied. The riser is exposed to unidirectional current, regular waves and vessel motions. The top tension is kept constant for each water depth. At 300 [m] water depth, the riser was found to be highly affected by vessel offsets, and the control objective for this depth must be to avoid any offset. At 2000 [m] water depth, however, both lower and upper angle will stabilize at acceptable magnitudes for the maximum static vessel offset studied in this thesis. The upper angle will however be excessive during the movement. The lower angle will not immediately respond to a motion at the top end of the riser, and it increases slowly for an increasing vessel offset. Hence, for a <b>drive-off,</b> which is an uncontrolled excursion of the vessel due to a failure in the DP system, the DP operator will have some time before a disconnect has to be carried out. The current affects the riser considerably more in deep waters compared to shallow waters. Also, first-order waves affect the upper angle significantly more than the lower angle, both in shallow and deep water. The watch circles which have been developed prove that the limits for a halt in the operation and a possible disconnect are larger than the conventional guidance limits. By allowing the top angle to become excessive during a limited amount of time, one can uphold the operation for a longer period of time, and also avoid an unnecessary disconnect. The main contributions in this thesis are the simulation study of the drilling riser and the proposed guidance limits for operation and disconnect.  </p...|$|E
