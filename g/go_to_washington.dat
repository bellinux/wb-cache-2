5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> {{and they had to}} turn back. The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York and then on to Albany and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.|$|E

5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Chandra Levy {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} a {{flashback}} of a five year old Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) lost in a park. In the present, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), leaves Grey {{and their two children}} to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to resign from the President's brain mapping project. While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone loses its signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Bannack, Idaho Territory, Edgerton reported to Territorial Governor William Wallace. Edgerton requested {{the designation of}} courts and districts, but no court was designated for his district. Wallace appointed Edgerton {{to one of the}} farthest and most remote places away from the capitol. When he arrived there was no administrator to administer the oath of office. He never took the oath of office and therefore he never legally took his position as Chief Justice. The Edgerton's then bought a home at a Sheriff's sale for $400. The one room home became the first Montana Governor's Residence. After {{arriving in}} his district, he began taking tours of the territory gold fields and gold camps. Edgerton realized the value of the gold fields, to the Union. He was then chosen, by the local population, to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C.. His mission was to lobby for the split of the Territory of Idaho. Edgerton and Sanders then left in a stagecoach for Washington. Edgerton arrived with $2,500 in gold nuggets in his pockets (about $34,000 in 2009). He presented this to President Abraham Lincoln and numerous members of Congress. His lobbying paid off in 1864. That year the Territory of Idaho split into three parts. The three parts included the Territory of Idaho, the Territory of Montana, and the Territory of Dakota.|$|E

500|$|The Build Now {{promotion}} and the Tiny Town project substantially increased homebuilding in Springfield. When {{the exhibition was}} over, many of the tiny homes were sold and the prize-winning structures were used as window displays in Springfield's major stores. The Tiny Town committee unsuccessfully petitioned the United States Post Office to appoint a [...] "postmaster" [...] and obtain a mailing address for the miniature city during the exposition. Before the Tiny Town exhibition opened, {{it was announced that}} a group of [...] "officials" [...] from the miniature city would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. to invite President Calvin Coolidge to visit; although {{people from all over the}} United States came to see the exhibit, Coolidge did not.|$|E
500|$|Secretary Hay was at The Fells when McKinley {{was shot}} by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, on September 6 in Buffalo. [...] With Vice President Roosevelt {{and much of the}} cabinet hastening to the bedside of McKinley, who had been {{operated}} on (it was thought successfully) soon after the shooting, Hay planned to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to manage the communication with foreign governments, but presidential secretary George Cortelyou urged him to come to Buffalo. He traveled to Buffalo on September 10; hearing on his arrival an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded that McKinley would die. He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley, giving a statement to the press, and went to Washington, as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed. [...] Hay was about to return to New Hampshire on the 13th, when word came that McKinley was dying. [...] Hay remained at his office and the next morning, on the way to Buffalo, the former Rough Rider received from Hay his first communication as head of state, officially informing President Roosevelt of McKinley's death.|$|E

[...] Despite his care, his testimony was a sensation: Custer was sharply criticized by the Republican press and loudly praised by the Democratic press.|$|E

He had come to teach about what he called [...] "the Ascended Masters". She later claimed to have received a vision while meditating with him that her role in life was to pass on a higher teaching to further humanity's spiritual evolution. She confided to Mark the next day that like him, she was also to be a messenger; he accepted her as a student at his mystical school, The Summit Lighthouse. She said she received another vision in June of that year {{in the way of a}} visitation by the Ascended Master El Morya who told her to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. to be trained as messenger.|$|E
2500|$|While Gilda was in release, it {{was widely}} {{reported}} that an atomic bomb which {{was scheduled to be}} tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: [...] "Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry. … She wanted to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic." [...] Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.|$|E
2500|$|Lamon's {{professional}} association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting {{attorney for the}} Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to Bloomington, Illinois, in 1858. [...] While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of abolitionism set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young Republican Party and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860. [...] Lincoln was up against New York Senator William Seward for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters. [...] When Lincoln was elected President, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post, but {{received a letter from}} his friend that said, [...] "Dear Hill, I need you. [...] I want you to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> with me and be prepared for a long stay." [...] Lamon then accompanied him as he traveled from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C. in February 1861. [...] This trip would prove to be eventful.|$|E

2500|$|After the Civil War broke out, {{the town}} of Concord, Massachusetts rallied, inspiring many young men to volunteer. The company {{assembled}} on the town common on April 19, 1861, {{the anniversary of the}} Battles of Lexington and Concord as they set off. Louisa May Alcott wrote to her friend Alf Whitman that it was [...] "a sight to behold". She was disappointed that she had to stay behind, lamenting, [...] "as I can't fight, I will content myself with working with those who can." [...] She joined local women who volunteered to sew clothes and provide other supplies. On her 30th birthday on November 29, 1862, she made up her mind to do more. She recorded in her journal, [...] "Thirty years old. Decide to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> as a nurse if I could find a place." [...] She received her orders on December 11 and made her way to Georgetown, outside of Washington, D.C. While working as a nurse, Alcott contracted typhoid fever and was treated with mercury in the form of calomel. She survived but later recorded, [...] "I was never ill before this time, and never well afterward." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ron Rosenbaum {{writes that}} the Inslaw story alone is enough to drive a sane man to madness. [...] "If they ever make a movie of the Inslaw suit," [...] he writes, [...] "it could be called Mrs. and Mrs. Smith <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> and Meet Franz Kafka." [...] Inslaw's founder, William A. Hamilton, in a {{previous}} position with the U.S. Justice Department, had helped develop a program called PROMIS, short for Prosecutor's Management Information System. PROMIS was designed to organize the paperwork generated by law enforcement and the courts. After he left the Justice Dept, Hamilton alleged {{that the government had}} stolen PROMIS and had distributed it illegally, robbing him of millions of dollars. The department denied this, insisting that they owned it because Hamilton had developed it while working for them. As a result of this dispute, Hamilton and the department had been in litigation since 1983. A federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the department had indeed taken the software by [...] "trickery, fraud, and deceit," [...] a decision upheld by a federal district court in 1988, but overturned on appeal in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The series uses green {{screen to}} augment the live action, {{inserting}} views of outdoor scenes in windows and broadcast images on TV monitors, often in post-production. The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, in a room that is a big three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. We have very long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions you see in the scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up driving plates, and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E
