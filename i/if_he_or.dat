5|$|The Act was {{repealed}} {{and replaced}} by the Royal Assent Act of 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she so desires.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to allowing the throw-pass, the Association modified the rules relating to holding-the-ball to prevent scrimmages. Under the rule, a player would be penalised <b>if</b> <b>he</b> held <b>or</b> {{dropped the ball}} after being tackled, but not <b>if</b> <b>he</b> kicked, handpassed <b>or</b> threw the ball away.|$|R
60|$|Will {{expressed}} himself {{ready to}} enter upon {{a state of}} reprobation <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>or</b> cared.|$|R
5|$|However, even {{if any of}} {{the above}} {{situations}} applies to a person, he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order.|$|E
5|$|She has {{suggested}} that {{to ensure that the}} institution of the Elected President continues to be legitimate, even if there is only one candidate in an election a vote should be held, and the candidate only declared elected <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she receives at least a specified percentage of votes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E

5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election {{to sit in the}} Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, {{a person may}} only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board, which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is Hindu. Similarly, one may only {{be a member of}} the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
50|$|The Chicche {{family had}} been a {{well-known}} 'gentlemanly' family in Canterbury since the 12th century. It is unknown <b>if</b> <b>he</b> married <b>or</b> had children.|$|R

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> {{she chooses to}} relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation {{could be due to}} hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands {{to the best}} of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she was from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured {{a balance between the}} two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E

25|$|As in Sale, {{the game}} was split into four rounds. Contestants begin with a score of $20. When Edward Phillips asks a question, the first {{contestant}} to buzz in {{had the chance to}} answer the question; <b>if</b> correct, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she gained $5; <b>if</b> wrong, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she lost $5. Phillips revealed the answer immediately if the contestant answered incorrectly; no other contestants were given the opportunity to answer. Contestants needed not wait until Phillips had finished asking the question before buzzing in.|$|R
60|$|This {{would seem}} to be a poetical note of preparation, agreed upon, as a caution to Durdles to stand clear <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can, <b>or</b> to betake himself homeward.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is also an}} offence, {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area, {{to be found in}} possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above. The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5000|$|Jason Pierce {{reported}} that he had a staph infection in his already injured foot and ankle. <b>He</b> wasn't sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could <b>or</b> would fight in his first round match.|$|R

5000|$|John Stuart, after 1802. It is {{not known}} if John {{remained}} in Canada or returned to Scotland with his father, nor is it known <b>if</b> <b>he</b> married <b>or</b> had any children.|$|R
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is judged to be insane {{under the terms of the}} Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has {{less than half of the}} total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
50|$|Against Ted's advice Neil {{takes the}} stand to profess his innocence. But on {{cross-examination}} {{he admits he}} was too high that night to even know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did <b>or</b> didn't kill Jessica.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gems, marbles, ivory, Tuscan statuettes, [...] Pictures, gold plate, Gætulian coverlets, [...] There are {{who have}} not. One there is, I trow, [...] Who cares not greatly <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has <b>or</b> no."[288] ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was married <b>or</b> had sired any {{children}} of his own.|$|R
