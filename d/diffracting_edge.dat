Results indicate that system orientation has little effect on minimizing the pressure gradient at the top of the barrier when the error sensors are invisible to the primary noise disturbance. Highly effective control within the shadow zone and close to the barrier is possible when the system is oriented at an angle where two or more error sensors are in line with the first <b>diffracting</b> <b>edge</b> and the primary noise disturbance.

40|$|The {{diffraction}} of an inhomogeneous electromagnetic {{plane wave}} obliquely incident {{on the edge}} of a perfectly conducting wedge is analyzed, to extend the results for the normal incidence case reported by Kouyoumjian et al. (1996). Uniform high-frequency expressions are obtained for the diffracted field in the format of the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (UTD). The generalized dyadic diffraction coefficient in the standard UTD ray-fixed coordinate system is represented by a 2 × 2 full matrix with the extra-diagonal terms accounting for a coupling between the two components of the incident and diffracted electric field parallel and perpendicular to the edge-fixed incidence and diffraction plane, respectively. The latter characteristic of the diffraction matrix is due to both the vectorial properties of the evanescent incident electric field and the inclusion of higher-order terms in the asymptotic expression of the edge diffracted field. The introduction of higher-order terms in the asymptotic evaluation also guarantees an improved accuracy for smaller values of the large parameter, namely, for observation points closer to the <b>diffracting</b> <b>edge,</b> as compared with the ordinary UTD...|$|E

Two basic subdivision strategies have been considered previously: {{one in which the}} segments are aligned with samples of the {{impulse response}} (i. e. each segment contributes to exactly one sample), and a second in which the segments are of a fixed length, and thus may contribute to one or multiple samples. In this paper, a hybrid subdivision strategy is proposed in which a sample-aligned segment is used only for the first sample of the IR, and evenly sized segments which span many samples are used to process the remainder of the edge. It has been found that the use of this hybrid method can result in a significant decrease in processing time with a minimal reduction in the accuracy of the IR calculation, and thus may allow for rapid diffraction calculations in complex, multi-edge simulation environments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Room impulse {{responses}} {{which include}} diffraction {{can be difficult}} to compute quickly because of the complexity of diffraction calculations and the large number of propagation paths which must be considered. One possible method to reduce processing time involves identifying and discarding insignificant diffracted paths before costly calculations are made, but the decision to cull a given path must consider the perceptual as well as computational consequences. In this paper we present two simple procedures for culling diffraction components during a room acoustics simulation. The first is based on the receiver's angular distance to the nearest reflection or shadow boundary, as well as the shortest path from the source to the receiver through the line that contains the <b>diffracting</b> <b>edge.</b> The second, which can be used independently or in combination with the first, is based on the onset amplitude of a diffraction impulse response, which can be computed relatively quickly and is highly correlated with the total diffracted energy. Both pruning methods retain high-energy components for processing, and the first explicitly ensures that discontinuities near the reflection and shadow boundaries are minimized to reduce audible artifacts in dynamic simulations. Results are presented from simulations in a simple concert-hall model. 1...|$|E

This, however, is NOT our case. We are, in fact, considering the situation of [...] "separable" [...] 3 D environments [12], which result from the cartesian product between a 2 D environment (floor map) and a 1 D (vertical) direction. This special geometry (sort of an extruded floor map) requires the modeling of diffraction and diffusion phenomena in a 3 D space. The Uniform Theory of Diffraction is, in fact, inherently three-dimensional, but our approach to the tracing of diffractive rays makes use of fast beam tracing, whose core is two dimensional. In {{order to be able}} to model UTD in fast beam tracing, we need therefore to first flatten the 3 D geometry onto a 2 D environment and later to adapt the 2 D diffractive rays to the 3 D nature of UTD. In order to clamp down the 3 D geometry to the floor map, we need to establish a correspondence between the 3 D geometric primitives that contribute to the Uniform Theory of Diffraction and some 2 D geometric primitives. For example, when projected on a floor map, an infinitely long <b>diffracting</b> <b>edge</b> becomes a diffractive point, and a 3 D diffracted ray becomes a 2 D diffracted ray. When tracing diffractive beams, each wedge illuminated (directly or indirectly) by the source will originate a disk of diffracted rays, as shown in Figure 8. At this point we need to consider the 3 D nature of the environment. We do so by [...] "lifting" [...] the diffracted rays in the vertical direction. We will end up with sort of an extruded cylinder containing all the rays that are diffracted by the edge. However, when we specify the locations of the source and the receiver, we find that this set includes also paths that do not honor the Keller cone condition [...]...|$|E

Unfortunately, current geometric acoustic modeling systems do not accurately simulate reverberant sound. Instead, they model only direct transmission and specular reflection, while diffraction is either ignored or modeled through statistical approximation. However, diffraction is extremely important for correct interpretation of acoustic environments, especially when the direct path between sound source and receiver is occluded. The Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) extends geometrical optics with diffraction phenomena: illuminated edges become secondary sources of diffracted rays that in turn may be reflected and diffracted. In this paper, we propose an efficient way for computing the acoustical effect of diffraction paths using the UTD for deriving secondary diffracted rays and associated diffraction coefficients. Our main contributions are: 1) a beam tracing method for enumerating sequences of <b>diffracting</b> <b>edges</b> efficiently and without aliasing in densely occluded polyhedral environments; 2) a practical approximation to simulated sound field in which diffraction is considered only in sound shadow regions; and 3) a real-time auralization system demonstrating that diffraction dramatically improves the audio quality in virtual environments...|$|R

Here, the particular assumption, present in all the past literature, that the two <b>diffracting</b> <b>edges</b> are coplanar is removed. The doubly diffracted (DD) field at a pair of wedges is constructed via spectral synthesis. Such a procedure provides a double spectral integral representation of the DD field that is asymptotically evaluated by resorting to transition functions, typical in double diffraction problems, that can be expressed in terms of generalized Fresnel integrals. The final expression is arranged in the typical UTD fashion and contains a uniform double diffraction dyadic coefficient. The DD field behavior is analyzed in its transition regions to show how the DD field smoothly compensates for the total field discontinuities occurring at shadow boundaries where a singly diffracted field from a wedge is shadowed by the other wedge.

For a surface profile calculation of this kind, it is necessary to know the margin of error built into the method of calculation. This will enable a specification of the tolerance from which the surface profile can be determined. When calculating the surface profile from near-field phase data, there are two main sources of error. The first is the measurement error in near-field phase data.

In this dissertation, {{the results of}} an experimental and numerical investigation into the behaviour of the free vortex generated by shock diffraction over edges yawed to the incident shock wave are presented. The objectives of this study were to explore the behaviour of the free vortex in three dimensions, with a particular focus on the distortions caused to the vortex by the presence of a solid boundary, or wall. Threedimensional numerical simulations and experimentally obtained schlieren photographs reveal significant distortion and bending of the free vortex in regions near the boundary of the flow domain, so as to meet it at a right angle. Experimentation was performed in a shock tube for incident shock Mach numbers of 1. 32, 1. 42, and 1. 65, with four test models, two incorporating straight diffraction edges, and two incorporating curved <b>diffracting</b> <b>edges.</b> Numerical simulation was performed with Fluent 6. 3. 26 software.

The effects of bending on the structure of the vortex and on the flow properties with the vortex are examined.

However, it has had limited use for large structures {{because of the large}} discrepancy between the reflector and target zone sizes.

Previous attempts to solve this problem have involved using serrated edges to diffuse the diffracted field. While this reduces the <b>edge</b> <b>diffracted</b> field in the target zone, it is not eliminated. In addition, one has introduced many new corners which also diffract into the target zone. A curved edge modification is presented which reduces the edge diffraction by an order of magnitude or more and in the process does not create new mechanisms which perturb the plane wave in the target zone. Using this curved modification, one is able to design a compact range reflector whose target zone cross section approaches the size of the reflector parabolic surface. This makes the compact range ideal for scale model measurements since larger targets (antennas) can be measured. It also makes it more practical to consider systems which can measure full scale vehicles...|$|R
