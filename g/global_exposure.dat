40|$|Background: In 2011 {{the largest}} measles {{outbreak}} in North America {{in a decade}} occurred in Quebec, Canada with over 700 cases. In contrast, measles activity in neighbouring province Ontario remained low (8 cases). Our objective {{was to determine the}} extent to which the difference could be explained by differing travel patterns. Methods: We explored the relationship between measles cases over 2007 – 2011, by importation classification, in Quebec and Ontario in relation to global travel patterns to each province using an ecological approach. <b>Global</b> measles <b>exposure</b> was estimated by multiplying the monthly traveler volume for each country of origin into Quebec or Ontario by the yearly measles incidence rate for the corresponding country. Visual inspection of temporal figures and calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients were performed. Results: <b>Global</b> measles <b>exposure</b> was similar in Ontario and Quebec. In Quebec, there was a nearly perfectly linear relationship between annual measles cases and its <b>global</b> measles <b>exposure</b> index over 2007 – 2011 (r = 0. 99, p = 0. 001). In contrast, there was a non-significant association in Ontario. The 2011 rise in Quebec’s index was largely driven by a dramatic increase in measles activity in France the same year. Conclusions: Global measles activity was associated with measles epidemiology in Quebec. <b>Global</b> measles <b>exposure</b> risk is higher in Ontario than Quebec. Differences in measles epidemiology between Ontario and Quebec from 2007 – 2011 are not explained by greater exposure in Quebec.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to modeling conditional credit loss distributions. Asset value changes of firms in a credit portfolio are linked to a dynamic global macroeconometric model, allowing macro effects to be isolated from idiosyncratic shocks from the perspective of default (and hence loss). Default probabilities are driven primarily by how firms are tied to business cycles, both domestic and foreign, and how business cycles are linked across countries. We allow for firm-specific business cycle effects and the heterogeneity of firm default thresholds using credit ratings. Our approach has the advantage that it does not rely on accounting data which are at best noisy and at worst biased due to the information asymmetries between company managers (agents) and share/debt holders (principals). The model can be used, for example, to compute the effects of a hypothetical negative equity price shock in South East Asia on the loss distribution of a credit portfolio with <b>global</b> <b>exposures</b> over one or more quarters. We show that the effects of such shocks on losses are asymmetric and non-proportional, reflecting the highly non-linear nature of the credit risk model. The overall results are quite reasonable: expected losses are in line with average charge-offs by U. S. banks over the last 14 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of cloud on the solar UVA (320 - 400 nm) exposures over five minute periods on a horizontal plane has been investigated. The first approach used cloud modification factors that were evaluated using the {{influence of}} clouds on the <b>global</b> solar <b>exposures</b> (310 - 2, 800 nm) and a model developed to apply these to the clear sky UVA exposures to allow calculation of the five minute UVA exposures for any cloud conditions.

This comparison of the modelled exposures for all cloud conditions to the measured data provided an R 2 of 0. 8 for the cloud modification model, compared to an R 2 of 0. 7 for the UVA/global model. The cloud modification model provided 73 % of the five minute exposures within 20 % of the measured UVA exposures. This was improved to 89 % of the exposures within 20 % of the measured UVA exposures for the cases of cloud with the sun not obscured. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: WHOs {{global burden}} of disease studies, {{undertaken}} since 1996, apportion the total global disease burden, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), to specific diseases and injuries. Recent assessments of the relative burden due to specific environmental risk factors, plus {{an understanding of the}} nature of the risk factor, may guide resource allocation in risk factor management. We report here the global disease burden due to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. Methods: A systematic literature review identified nine diseases with sufficient evidence of a causal relationship with UVR exposure and for which the population attributable fraction (PAF) for UVR could be estimated. For cutaneous malignant melanoma and cataract, the PAF was directly applied to disease burdens already calculated by WHO. For seven other diseases, we developed population-level exposuredisease relationships and used these to calculate disease incidence and mortality, and thence disease burden. We also estimated the disease burden from rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis that might result if <b>global</b> UVR <b>exposure</b> was reduced to very low levels. Results: UVR exposure is a minor contributor to the worlds disease burden, causing an estimated annual loss of 1. 6 million DALYs; i. e. 0. 1 of the total global disease burden. A markedly larger annual disease burden, 3. 3 billion DALYs, might result from reduction in <b>global</b> UVR <b>exposure</b> to very low levels. Conclusions: Sun protection messages are important to prevent diseases of UVR exposure. However, without high dietary (or supplemental) intake of vitamin D, some sun exposure is essential to avoid diseases of vitamin D insufficiency...|$|R
