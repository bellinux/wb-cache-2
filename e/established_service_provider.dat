40|$|Abstract — The {{concept of}} “service ” has been {{characterized}} by different disciplines and authors from various points of view. The variety of characterizations reveals that this notion, although an intuitive one, is far from trivial. Given the importance of services in enterprise computing and Service Science in general, we believe that a clear account of services and service-related concepts is necessary and {{would serve as a}} basis for communication, consensus and alignment of various approaches and perspectives. In this paper we propose a commitment-based account of the notion of service captured in a core reference ontology called UFO-S. We address the commitments <b>established</b> between <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and customers, and show how such commitments affect the service lifecycle. We show that the commitment-based account can serve to harmonize different notions of service in the literature...|$|R

30|$|The current mobile {{broadcast}} {{systems do}} not provide efficient solution for consumption of service and content based on the user identity card such as a smartcard. This prevents users from consuming broadcast service and contents independent of a specific terminal (e.g., the one used for registration or purchase). To provide usage of broadcast services based on the user identity card, mutual authentication needs to be <b>established</b> among the <b>service</b> <b>provider,</b> the terminal, and the user identity card whenever the terminal is changed. The crucial element for this is assuring the <b>service</b> <b>provider,</b> the terminal, and the user identity card by authenticating each entity to the other entities. In this paper, we propose the new authentication scheme, which provides efficient scheme for three kinds of mutual authentications among the <b>service</b> <b>provider,</b> the terminal, and the user identity card. We also construct mobile broadcast DRM system based on the proposed authentication scheme for consumption of broadcast services with multiple terminals.|$|R

Working {{with a wide range}} of locally <b>established</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> CDI is delivering services to children and families which meet identified needs. Etch of these is being rigorously evaluated, and considerable attention is being given to quality assurance, promotion of reflective practice, and professional training and support. The insights gained, and techniques developed during this process are central to delivering high quality services with the view to improving our understanding of what enables children to meet their potential, gain their developmental milestones within appropriate timeframes and become healthy and active citizens.   This Workbook describes key processes relating to practice, organisational culture and systems change which support the implementation of evidence-based and evidence-informed programmes and practices. From CDI's experience, implementing evidence-based programmes not only requires specific structures and processes in place to support programme implementation and fidelity (e. g. training, coaching, and supervision) but also necessities a focus on the more generic aspects of delivering quality services (e. g. engaging in reflective practice in order to promote and maintain fidelity to a programme).   The Workbook also addresses some fundamental areas in relation to monitoring and evaluation as a way of determining whether an intervention was effective or not. In effect, this Workbook hopes to explain the 'what', 'why', 'how' and 'did we?' of evidence-based practice. The Workbook is intended to provide readers with a comprehensive introduction to both the shared language and concepts underpinning the science and practice of implementation. It complements the 'What Works Process' guide published by the Centre for Effective Services (CES, 2011) which supports services in assessing how effective they are in improving outcomes for children and helps them to think about what works...|$|R

40|$|The owner {{may involve}} design and {{construction}} <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in a project {{at different stages of}} planning and design. Early involvement of the versatile know-how of <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> places the owner at the services providers' mercy as to pricing. Late involvement, when design is close to completion, allows using price competition to ensure reasonable pricing. Then, design usually does not involve interplay between the key parties to benefit the project. The aim of the conceptualization is to overcome the above-mentioned problem by generating a novel type of two-stage target-cost contracting system which combines early selection and price containment. There the calculated tender price is based on both the owner's estimates and the tenderers' unit cost and overhead data while the project scope is not yet fully <b>established.</b> Selected <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> then develop the project and its designs in cooperation with the owner before the actual target-cost is set. Incentives have been created to lower the target-cost below the earlier calculated tender price. The idea is to spur actors to invest especially in the critical pre-implementation development phase. Subsequent risk sharing is believed to increase the cooperation between parties further. The model offers a means, especially for European public owners, to enter into a cooperative relationship that is of value in the case of projects involving special challenges {{and a great deal of}} uncertainty.

40|$|Authentication is {{the first}} step toward <b>establishing</b> a <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> and {{customer}} (C-P) association. In a mobile network environment, a lightweight and secure authentication protocol is one of the most significant factors to enhance the degree of service persistence. This work presents a secure and lightweight keying and authentication protocol suite termed TAP (Time-Assisted Authentication Protocol). TAP improves the security of protocols with the assistance of time-based encryption keys and scales down the authentication complexity by issuing a re-authentication ticket. While moving across the network, a mobile customer node sends a re-authentication ticket to establish new sessions with service-providing nodes. Consequently, this reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. In the keying protocol suite, a key distributor controls the key generation arguments and time factors, while other participants independently generate a keychain based on key generation arguments. We undertake a rigorous security analysis and prove the security strength of TAP using CSP and rank function analysis.

40|$|Software Engineering TrackInternational audienceReal-time {{features}} and software runtime adaptation are two requirements of modern software. On the one hand, {{the most important}} characteristics in real-time applications are their predictable behavior and deterministic execution time. On the other hand, runtime adaptive software are capable of being updated and reconfigured at execution time, making them more flexible and available. The OSGi Service Platform has become the de facto platform for developing flexible and modular software, due to its simple service-oriented component model. Many Java applications are being migrated to and developed for the OSGi Platform's component model. However, due to the popularization of real-time solutions such as the Real-Time Specification for Java, some of these applications may have timing constraints which cannot be respected because of the platform's dynamic behavior {{and the fact that}} service-oriented component-based application architectures may change at execution time. This paper proposes to delay reconfigurations for after critical processing, according to <b>Service</b> Level Agreements <b>established</b> between <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and consumers.
