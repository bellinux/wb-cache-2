40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that glucocorticoids impair <b>memory</b> <b>retrieval.</b> The present study examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats the effects of systemically administered corticosterone on <b>retrieval</b> of <b>memory</b> for inhibitory avoidance training. Corticosterone (3. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) injected 30 min before retention testing, 48 h after training, significantly impaired retention performance, as compared to vehicle treatment, of rats tested in the training context. In contrast, corticosterone administration did not impair retrieval when rats were tested for retention in a different context. Corticosterone did also not impair retention performance of rats given a mild-intensity footshock that resulted in only weak, non-contextual memory. These findings strongly suggest that corticosterone selectively impaired retrieval of contextual information associated with the training context. The centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2. 0 mg/kg), co-administered in a dose that did not affect retention performance alone, blocked the impairment <b>in</b> contextual <b>memory</b> <b>retrieval</b> induced by corticosterone.

[...] Memory retrieval, especially retrieval of emotional memories, is impaired when healthy subjects are given doses of cortisol.

In phobia patients, cortisol can be administered before a fearful stimuli is presented, halting the retrieval of fear memories. Memory consolidation of the corrective experience is enhanced, facilitating fear extinction. If this procedure is repeated over time, the fear memory eventually gets weaker.|$|E

50|$|Cognitive {{interviews}} {{were developed in}} 1984 by researchers Geiselman, Fisher and their colleagues {{in response to the}} ineffective police interviewing techniques used in the past. Their goal was to suggest methods that increased the accuracies of eyewitness testimony. They found that when participants were trained <b>in</b> <b>memory</b> <b>retrieval</b> techniques, the participants recalled more correct information about an event that occurred on a questionnaire. They based the techniques on four general memory retrieval rules based on the encoding specificity principle, and the assumption that memory traces are usually complex with various kinds of information. In 1985 Geiselman, Fisher and their colleagues MacKinnon and Holland further showed that the cognitive interview had ecological validity by having participants watch videos of simulated violent crimes. The original concept of the cognitive interview was revised in 1987 by Fisher, Geiselman and their colleagues. The revisions to the original cognitive interview incorporated the idea of structuring the interview to be more compatible with how the brain retrieves memories. The revised version of the cognitive interview showed an increase of 45 percent in correct information retrieved. In 1992, Fisher and Geiselman wrote a training manual for investigative services on how to conduct a cognitive interview. The techniques they developed are widely used today by a variety of investigative services such as police departments, private investigators, and attorneys.|$|E

The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field [...] One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words.

50|$|Richard Webster, {{writing in}} Why Freud Was Wrong (1995), {{compared}} The Assault on Truth to E. M. Thornton's The Freudian Fallacy (1983), finding both authors hostile towards Freud and psychoanalysis. However, {{he suggested that}} Masson nevertheless retained a partly positive view of Freud. Webster credited Masson with making some contributions {{to the history of}} psychoanalysis, but wrote that his central argument has not convinced either the psychoanalytic establishment or the majority of Freud's critics, as Masson accepted that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients, an account disputed by scholars such as Cioffi, Thornton, Han Israëls, and Morton Schatzman, who have argued that Freud's original account of his therapeutic methods suggests that this is not what occurred. According to Webster, Freud's seduction theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of his therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. Webster blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that orthodox psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of incest was required. Masson rejected Webster's suggestion that he encouraged the recovered memory movement, writing that he had no interest <b>in</b> <b>memory</b> <b>retrieval</b> in The Assault on Truth.|$|E
