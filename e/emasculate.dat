5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to <b>emasculate</b> Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E

25|$|The Khitan {{adopted the}} {{practice}} of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a nomadic Mongolic people and originally did not have eunuchs {{as part of their}} culture. When the Khitan founded the Liao Dynasty they developed a harem system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. The eunuchs were not Khitan and they came from two sources, all of their eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the Central Plains. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded the Later Jin. Another source was during their war with the Chinese Song dynasty, the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and <b>emasculate</b> them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and <b>emasculate</b> the boys.|$|E

25|$|Sex {{may also}} be derived from another prokaryotic process. A {{comprehensive}} 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy to uncouple (and thereby <b>emasculate)</b> the acquired symbiont genomes.|$|E
25|$|Held {{that the}} Constitution of India which is {{essentially}} a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or <b>emasculate</b> those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is {{the ultimate goal of}} every Government {{but that does not mean}} that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.|$|E
25|$|Held {{that the}} word 'amendment' {{was used in the}} sense of {{permitting}} a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they hen, conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did not comprehend the power to totally abrogate or <b>emasculate</b> or damage any of the fundamental rights or the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} the breeding system, pollination experiments {{were performed on}} randomly chosen from 10 trees in the population. On each plant, 4 to 10 inflorescences (depending on availability on each plant) were randomly tagged and {{only one of the}} treatments assigned to each inflorescence (i.e. to every single flower on that inflorescence). Inflorescences (n[*]=[*] 6 for each treatment) subjected to hand-pollination were bagged with thick waterproof paper bags before anthesis and bagged again after hand-pollination. The pollination bags were partly opened 5  days after each treatment to monitor fruit set. When required, the flowers were <b>emasculated</b> on the day of anthesis, before the anthers dehisced. The following treatments were conducted (Saunders and Sedonia, 2006): (1) Control: the flowers were tagged and left to open pollination; (2) Geitonogamy: <b>emasculated</b> and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from the same plant but from another flower (to test for self-compatibility); (3) Xenogamy: <b>emasculated</b> and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from different plants (to test for outcrossing ability); (4) Cross-pollination under natural conditions: uncovered and <b>emasculated</b> flowers were pollinated freely (to test for pollen limitation); (5) Autogamy: flower buds were bagged and isolated from visitors (to test for autonomous self-pollination within a single flower); (6) Apomixis: flowers were bagged and <b>emasculated</b> before anthesis (to test for the agamospermy).|$|R

By 1973, the basic structure doctrine triumphed in Justice Hans Raj Khanna's judgment in the landmark decision of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. Previously, the Supreme Court had held that the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution was unfettered.

Our frailties are invincible, our virtues barren; the battle goes sore against us to the going down of the sun.

It is not strange if we are tempted to despair of good. We ask too much. [...] Our religions and moralities have been trimmed to flatter us, till they are all <b>emasculate</b> and sentimentalised, and only please and weaken. Truth is of a rougher strain.

6000|$|For an eclectic, if it mean, anything, means this--one who, in any {{branch of}} art or science, refuses to {{acknowledge}} Bacon's great law, [...] "that nature is only conquered by obeying her;" [...] {{who will not}} take a full and reverent view of the whole mass of facts with which he has to deal, and from them deducing the fundamental laws of his subject, obey them whithersoever they may lead; but who picks and chooses out of them just so many as may be pleasant to his private taste, and then constructs a partial system which differs from the essential ideas of nature, {{in proportion to the}} number of facts which he has determined to discard. And such a course was pursued in the art by the ascetic painters between the time of Giotto and Raphael. Their idea of beauty was a partial and a Manichean one; in their adoration for a fictitious [...] "angelic nature," [...] made up from all which is negative in humanity, they were prone to despise all by which man is brought in contact with this earth--the beauties of sex, of strength, of activity, of grandeur of form; all, that is, in which Greek art excels: their ideal of beauty was altogether effeminate. They prudishly despised the anatomic study of the human figure, of landscape and chiaroscuro. Spiritual expression with them was everything; but it was only the expression of the passive spiritual faculties of innocence, devotion, meekness, resignation--all good, but not the whole of humanity. Not that they could be quite consistent in their theory. They were forced to paint their very angels as human beings; and a standard of human beauty they had to find somewhere; and they found one, strange to say, exactly like that of the old Pagan statues (wings and all--for the wings of Christian angels are copied exactly from those of Greek Genii), and only differing in that ascetic and <b>emasculate</b> tone, which was peculiar to themselves. Here is a dilemma which the worshippers of high art have slurred over. Where did Angelico de Fiesole get the idea of beauty which dictated his exquisite angels? We shall not, I suppose, agree with those who attribute it to direct inspiration, and speak of it as the reward of the prayer and fasting by which the good monk used to prepare himself for painting. Must we then confess that he borrowed his beauties from the faces of the prettiest nuns with whom he was acquainted? That would be sad naturalism; and sad eclecticism too, considering that he must have seen among his Italian sisters a great many beauties of a very different type from that which he has chosen to copy; though, we suppose, of God's making equally with that of his favourites. Or did he, in spite of himself, steal a side-glance now and then at some of the unrivalled antique statues of his country, and copy on the sly any feature or proportion in them which was <b>emasculate</b> enough to be worked into his pictures? That, too, is likely enough; nay, it is certain. We are perfectly astonished how any draughtsman, at least how such a critic as M. Rio, can look at the early Italian painters without tracing everywhere in them the classic touch, the peculiar tendency to mathematic curves in the outlines, which is the distinctive peculiarity of Greek art. Is not Giotto, the father of Italian art, full of it in every line? Is not Perugino? Is not the angel of Lorenzo Credi in Mrs. Jameson's woodcut? Is not Francia, except just where he is stiff, and soft, and clumsy? Is not Fra Angelico himself? Is it not just the absence of this Greek tendency to mathematical forms in the German painters before Albert Durer, which makes the specific difference, evident to every boy, between the drawing of the Teutonic and Italian schools? ...|$|E

So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with the Romans at Mr. Jacob's academy, his knowledge was strictly correct, but it went no farther than the fact that they were [...] "in the New Testament"; and Mr. Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and <b>emasculate</b> his pupil's mind by simplifying and explaining, or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering, extraneous information, such as is given to girls.|$|E
