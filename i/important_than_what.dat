500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1932–33 season, Shankly {{received}} a telegram from Carlisle United {{asking him to}} return {{as soon as possible}} because another club wanted to sign him. Arriving at Carlisle, he discovered that the interested club was Preston North End who had offered a transfer fee of £500. The terms for Shankly personally were a fee of £50 plus a £10 signing-on fee and wages of five pounds a week. Shankly's initial reaction was that it was not enough and the deal nearly fell through. Shankly's brother Alec pointed out to him that Preston were in the Second Division and a bigger club than Carlisle with the potential to regain First Division status. Alec convinced Bill that the opportunity was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he would be paid immediately: [...] "it's what you're going to get later that counts". Shankly took his brother's advice and signed the Preston contract in a railway carriage.|$|E

500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E

[...] Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album [...] "proved that Madonna, {{approaching}} 50 years-old, is a vital force in the ever-expansive landscape of popular music." [...] Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that [...] "ith Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna at long last finds her musical footing. Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb." [...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment is far more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> they mean, and Madonna knows that better than anyone. Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments. It will leave you feeling silly for all the right reasons." ...|$|E

However, the dialogue, described as [...] "robust and prosaic", {{was said to}} sit [...] "ill-at-ease with the metaphysical ponderings". Anderson also {{expressed concern about the}} editing, stating that every effects shot precedes another shot [...] "with that 'Hornby' factor, slowing up the narrative unnecessarily". Doppelgänger is awarded a rating of three stars out of five, and is summarised as [...] "an interesting journey with many rewards". Glenn Erickson, commenting in 2008 on the website DVD Talk, argued that Doppelgänger [...] "takes an okay premise but does next to nothing with it. We see 100 minutes of bad drama and good special effects, and then the script opts for frustration and meaningless mystery." [...] He complained of unappealing cinematography, comparing it to the premise of Thunderbirds in so far as [...] "people stand and talk a lot", while defining the script as being composed of [...] "at least 60 percent hardware-talk and exposition...

500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about this young man who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper going on as well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E

5000|$|Some critics {{pointed out}} that Niemeyer's {{architecture}} was often in opposition to his views. His first major work, Pampulha, had a bourgeois character and Brasília was famous for its palaces. Niemeyer never saw architecture {{in the same way}} as Walter Gropius, who defended a rational and industrial architecture capable of molding society to make it suitable for the new industrial era. Skeptical about architecture's ability to change an [...] "unjust society", Niemeyer defended that such activism should be undertaken politically. Using architecture for such purposes would be anti-modern (as it would be limiting constructive technology). Niemeyer says: [...] "Our concern is political too - to change the world ...

2500|$|... 2-Iodomelatonin was {{synthesized}} in 1986 and its radioligand, 2--melatonin, {{has been}} useful in finding cellular targets of melatonin. Though the melatonin receptor wasn’t characterized and cloned {{in the human}} being until 1994 {{it was possible to}} start carrying out binding studies in various tissues before that time. As mentioned in the structure-activity relationship chapter above, certain groups are important for the activity. The most important groups are the 5-methoxy group and the acylaminoethyl side-chain, because they bind to and activate the receptors. The –NH group of the indole ring is not important for binding and activation. Therefore it is possible to replace it with other aromatic ring systems. The aromatic ring and the ethyl side-chain hold the correct distance between those two groups. The correct distance is the key to good binding and more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> type of aromatic ring system the analogue contains. Therefore it is possible to use different ring systems in melatonin receptor analogues, if the distance is right.|$|E

For experiments, white noise is necessary because it takes the place of these imperfections in speech. One of the most important factors in language is continuity and in turn intelligibility.|$|R

However, while China’s international strategy is currently undergoing major transformations, 1 at the unofficial level China’s intellectual elite have been advancing a diverse set of arguments about China’s future international role.

She stood watching Fleur row back; the girl took her hand off a scull to wave farewell, and June walked languidly on between the meadows and the river, with an ache in her heart. Youth to youth, like the dragon-flies chasing each other, and love like the sun warming them through and through. Her youth! So long ago--when Phil and she--And since? Nothing--no one had been quite what she had wanted. And so she had missed it all. But what a coil was round those two young things, if they really were in love, as Holly would have it--as her father, and Irene, and Soames himself seemed to dread. What a coil, and what a barrier! And the itch for the future, the contempt, as it were, for what was overpast, which forms the active principle, moved {{in the heart of}} one who ever believed that what one wanted was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>what</b> other people did not want. From the bank, awhile, in the warm summer stillness, she watched the water-lily plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising; sniffed the scent of grass and meadow-sweet, wondering how she could force everybody to be happy.
