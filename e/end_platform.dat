5|$|The third island {{platform}} comprises platforms 9 to 12 and also {{dates from the}} 1930s. It is longer than platforms 5–8 but the rear of a High Speed Train on the west end platforms will block part of the east <b>end</b> <b>platform.</b> A wide variety of trains use these platforms, including to and from London Paddington and London Waterloo and Weymouth.|$|E
2500|$|This Manlove Alliott {{design was}} a {{self-propelled}} steam vehicle having a vertical boiler on each <b>end</b> <b>platform</b> {{with the engine}} mounted below the saloon floor. The upper deck had knife-board seats, back to back, with a top canopy and open sides and ends, with modesty rails. The boiler chimneys ran up and through the roof, at each end, serving coke boilers 25½ inches in diameter and [...] high. The two-cylinder steam engine had a piston bore of 7½ inches and a stroke of 9inches. Unladen it weighed 9 tons and was capable of carrying 50 passengers.|$|E
60|$|Then as, {{with the}} red, {{quartered}} ensign fluttering above the head-lamp and each <b>end</b> <b>platform</b> crowded, the train passed the last construction camp, {{a swarm of}} blue-shirted toilers cast their hats into the air, and the scream of the brakes was drowned in a mighty cheer, while I found myself cheering vehemently among the rest. The blasts ceased at the funnel, and as the slackening couplings clashed while the cars rolled slowly through the eddying dust I started in amaze, for there were two faces at the unglazed windows of the decorated observation car which I knew well, but had never expected to see there. Martin Lorimer waved his hand toward me as the train stopped, my cousin Alice stood beside him smiling a greeting, and with shame I remembered how long it was since I had sent news to her.|$|E
50|$|In October 2013, {{three new}} small shelters were {{built at the}} <b>ends</b> of both <b>{{platforms}}.</b> Platform 1 has shelters at each <b>end,</b> while <b>Platform</b> 2 has one at the Down (Lilydale) <b>end.</b> Both <b>platforms</b> also had raised platforms installed, reducing {{the need for a}} wheelchair ramp to be used.|$|R
50|$|Single or double <b>ended</b> access <b>platforms</b> {{are another}} {{variation}} of the mobile safety steps. As with standard mobile safety steps they have wheels which can be secured by a hand operated lever, but will have a larger platform. This allows for activities like maintenance work on walls, machinery and aircraft. The double <b>ended</b> <b>platform</b> will have two sets of steps with a platform in between.|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have beige windscreens {{along their}} entire lengths and brown canopies with green frames and support columns {{except for a}} small section at either <b>ends.</b> <b>Platform</b> signs display 80 Street - Hudson Street, which was the original name of this station.|$|R
6000|$|Three hours afterwards, I {{was seated}} on the <b>end</b> <b>platform</b> of the train as it swept eastward through the gorges and thundered in tunnels of the mountains. The change of scene, the sense of escape, the still {{throbbing}} terror of pursuit--above all the astounding magic of my new conveyance, kept me from any logical or melancholy thought. I {{had gone to the}} doctor's house two nights before prepared to die, prepared for worse than death; what had passed, terrible although it was, looked almost bright compared to my anticipations; and it was not till I had slept a full night in the flying palace car that I awoke to the sense of my irreparable loss and to some reasonable alarm about the future. In this mood I examined the contents of the bag. It was well supplied with gold; it contained tickets and complete directions for my journey as far as Liverpool, and a long letter from the doctor, supplying me with a fictitious name and story, recommending the most guarded silence, and bidding me to await faithfully the coming of his son. All then had been arranged beforehand: he had counted upon my consent, and, what was tenfold worse, upon my mother's voluntary death. My horror of my only friend, my aversion for this son who was to marry me, my revolt against the whole current and conditions of my life, were now complete. I was sitting stupefied by my distress and helplessness, when, to my joy, a very pleasant lady offered me her conversation. I clutched at the relief; and I was soon glibly telling her the story in the doctor's letter: how I was a Miss Gould, of Nevada City, going to England to an uncle, what money I had, what family, my age, and so forth, until I had exhausted my instructions, and, as the lady still continued to ply me with questions, began to embroider on my own account. This soon carried one of my inexperience beyond her depth; and I had already remarked a shadow on the lady's face, when a gentleman drew near and very civilly addressed me: ...|$|E

50|$|Cars 67A and 68A, {{built at}} Williamstown Workshops in 1880, were rebuilt as Ministerial Cars 2 and 1 {{respectively}} in 1894. The two cars were externally identical, but Ministerial No.2 was reversed against No.1 {{so the two}} end platforms met in the middle, and the two cars had slightly different interiors. Each car had nine window-panels per side, plus the <b>end</b> <b>platform</b> section. Ministerial No.1 had its access door at the second panel; the diagram shows that section as the Lavatory, {{but it was not}} connected to the water closet and apparently acted more as a vestibule. There was an adjacent WC and then a large saloon, with a table, four seats and a three-seater bench, then the 2 ft <b>end</b> <b>platform.</b> Ministerial No.2 was something of a mirror image internally, with its <b>end</b> <b>platform</b> then saloon with a smaller table, two long benches for five each, a WC on the same side as Ministerial No.1, and another lavatory/vestibule with access doors.|$|E
