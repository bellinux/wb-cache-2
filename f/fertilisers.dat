5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. <b>Fertilisers</b> generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus <b>fertilisers</b> are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy and grows in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. <b>Fertilisers</b> high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though <b>fertilisers</b> specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and <b>fertilisers</b> low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> has the {{potential}} to replace conventional biochar and organic <b>fertiliser</b> to improve soil quality and increase plant photosynthesis. This study explored mechanisms involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in both soil and ginger plants (Zingiber officinale: Zingiberaceae) following different treatments including organic <b>fertiliser,</b> commercial bamboo biochar <b>fertiliser,</b> and organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser.</b> Materials and methods: Soil received four treatments including (1) commercial organic <b>fertiliser</b> (5 t ha− 1) as the control, (2) commercial bamboo biochar <b>fertiliser</b> (5 t ha− 1), (3) organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> at a low rate (3 t ha− 1), and (4) organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> at a high rate (7. 5 t ha− 1). C and N fractions of soil and plant, and gas exchange measurements were analysed. Results and discussion: Initially, organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> applied at the low rate increased leaf N. Organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> applied at the high rate significantly increased N use efficiency (NUE) of the aboveground biomass compared with other treatments and improved photosynthesis compared with the control. There was N fractionation during plant N uptake and assimilation since the 15 N enrichment between the root, leaf, and stem were significantly different from zero; however, treatments did not affect this N fractionation. Conclusions: Organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> has agronomic advantages over inorganic and raw organic (manure-based) N <b>fertiliser</b> because it allows farmer to put high concentrations of nutrients into soil without restricting N availability, N uptake, and plant photosynthesis. We recommend applying the low rate of organo-mineral biochar <b>fertiliser</b> as a substitute for commercial organic <b>fertiliser.</b> © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH German...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{viability}} of inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> use in Uganda, using the 2005 / 06 Uganda National Household Survey data. We also explore the farmers’ characteristics under which <b>fertiliser</b> use is more profitable. We find that inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> use is more profitable {{for only a few}} crops and less profitable or unprofitable for most crops, even when their yield is high. Furthermore, we find that farmer profit with <b>fertiliser</b> use increases with access to extension services and/or use of improved seeds. Thus, blanket promotion of <b>fertiliser</b> use, without a case-by-case consideration of fertiliser-crop profitability is likely to be counter-productive to the drive of increasing agricultural productivity and household income in Uganda. Hence, the drive to increase <b>fertiliser</b> use in Uganda can succeed only if farmers are widely sensitized not about the potential of <b>fertiliser</b> to increase yield but the crops on which <b>fertiliser</b> use is more profitable and the preconditions for its profitability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} agronomic strategies on the nutritional quality of head lettuce was investigated. The factors included were irrigation type, <b>fertiliser</b> input type and level. The assessed ingredient parameters were nitrate, lutein, ß-carotene and polyphenols. Hygiene {{was described by}} total aerobic bacterial count and number of coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Lettuce treated with mineral nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> (calcium ammonium nitrate) displayed a higher nitrate content than lettuce treated with organic manures (fresh farmyard manure (FYM), rotten FYM (fermented nettle extract). Nitrate concentration in lettuce tended to increase with increasing amounts of <b>fertiliser,</b> independent of <b>fertiliser</b> type. <b>Fertiliser</b> type and level also affected the carotenoid content. Rapidly available nitrogen from mineral <b>fertiliser</b> gave higher lutein levels compared with slowly released nitrogen. Similar results were observed for ß-carotene.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) <b>fertiliser</b> {{management in the}} Australian sugar industry was undertaken to identify new strategies to improve N <b>fertiliser</b> use efficiency and to fill gaps in knowledge relevant to N <b>fertiliser</b> management. The Australian sugar industry {{has a history of}} high N <b>fertiliser</b> usage, with applications increasing from the 1960 s to the late 1990 s. However, industry average sugarcane production has not kept pace with N <b>fertiliser</b> applications, resulting in a steady increase in N <b>fertiliser</b> applied per ton of sugarcane harvested. Historical and recently developed N management strategies rely on matching N applications to the predicted/expected yield of the forthcoming crop. High applications of N <b>fertiliser</b> by farmers are a rational reaction to (i) the uncertainty of these predictions/expectations, and (ii) the yield reductions caused by long-term under-fertilising with N. While sustained under-application of N undoubtedly reduces cane yields, there is considerable evidence in the Australian industry that greatly reducing N <b>fertiliser</b> applications for a single crop does not significantly reduce sugarcane production. Consequently, a new philosophy of N <b>fertiliser</b> management can be envisaged, that removes the uncertainty drivin...|$|R

These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of <b>fertilisers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in <b>fertilisers</b> and energy-stores, {{nitrogen}} is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen <b>fertilisers.</b> At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of using public works to stimulate farmers' <b>fertiliser</b> use in India's SAT. Inadequate replenishment of removed nutrients and organic matter has reduced fertility and increased erosion rates. <b>Fertiliser</b> use, along with other complementary measures, can help reverse this process, which ultimately leads to poverty, hunger, and further environmental degradation. In a high-risk environment like India's SAT, there may be a strong relation between off-farm income and smallholder <b>fertiliser</b> use. Farmers can use the main source of off-farm income, wage income, to manage risk as well as to finance inputs. Consequently, the introduction of public works programmes in areas with high dry-season unemployment may affect <b>fertiliser</b> use. This study confirms the relevance of risk for decisions regarding <b>fertiliser</b> use in two Indian villages. Nevertheless, governments cannot use employment policies to stimulate <b>fertiliser</b> use. Public works even decrease <b>fertiliser</b> use in the survey setting...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{negative}} effects of soil fertility depletion on food security, especially among smallholder farmers in Africa, is of economic importance, and may be worsened by climate change and rising global <b>fertiliser</b> prices. Substantial efforts and investment have gone into development of alternative soil fertility management options. These include vigorous {{research and development of}} N-fixing plants or "fertiliser trees", that has been on-going {{in the last two decades}} in East and Southern Africa. In this paper, we review several studies conducted both on-station and on-farm and synthesise the results in terms of improvements in soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and crop yield in response to <b>fertiliser</b> trees. Our major findings are that (1) <b>fertiliser</b> trees add more than 60 kg N ha− 1 per year through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF); (2) nutrient contributions from <b>fertiliser</b> tree biomass can reduce the requirement for mineral N <b>fertiliser</b> by 75 %, translating to huge savings on mineral fertilisers; (3) <b>fertiliser</b> trees were also shown to substantially increase crop yield. A meta-analysis has further provided conclusive evidence that with good management, <b>fertiliser</b> trees can double maize yields compared with local farmer practices of maize cultivation without addition of external fertilisation. (4) Financial analyses showed that <b>fertiliser</b> tree systems are profitable and also have higher net returns than the farmers' de facto practice, i. e. continuous maize cropping without <b>fertiliser.</b> We conclude that widespread adoption and scaling up of <b>fertiliser</b> trees can reduce the amount of mineral <b>fertiliser</b> needed, maintain the soil ecosystem, and positively impact on the livelihoods of farm households in southern Africa...|$|R
