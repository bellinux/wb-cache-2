2500|$|The {{characters}} of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles {{as having a}} [...] "strong 'bite me' vibe" [...] and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda. In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> will probably depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said I, [...] "I think it's {{about time}} for us to be moving along. I'm {{beginning}} to <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Corny family as you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are to be}} {{everything}} to me, {{and they can be}} nothing to me without you. You know that, I suppose?" [...] Then she waited for his reply. [...] "You know that, do you not? You know what I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I say. Why do you not tell me? Have you any doubt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is a problem," [...] sighed Mrs. Kingsley. [...] "I feel helpless--out of it. Elinor does precisely {{what she wants to}} do. She wears outlandish clothes. She smokes and--I'm afraid drinks. And dances--dreadfully. Just like the other girls--no better, no worse. But with all that I think she's good. I feel the same as Jane <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> In spite of this--this modern stuff I believe all the girls are fundamentally the same as ten years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men are {{different}} from women, I suppose. I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> him <b>that</b> whatever he might do I should forgive it. But then I feel, also, {{that he would never}} do anything for me to forgive." ...|$|R
6000|$|LAWTON: 'Well, {{vaccination}} {{is always}} a very serious thing--with a first child. I should say, from the way Mrs. Miller <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>that</b> Miller wouldn't {{be able to be}} out for a week to come yet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR JOHN. By these--whom you uphold. Katherine {{asked me}} to let you know. She's gone to Helen. I {{understand}} you only came back last night from your----No word I can use would give what I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I don't know how things stand now between you and Katherine; but I tell you this, Stephen: you've tried her these last two months beyond what any woman ought to bear! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You correct me," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I {{expressed}} myself ill. I {{should have}} said {{that those who have}} great thoughts get too much worn in working them out. I used to <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> even when I was a little girl; and it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life would be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen might be lighter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, isn't this enough," [...] cried Olive, [...] "to {{make any}} girl spread her wings and {{fly to the}} ends of the earth? But I have no wings; they have all gone away in a dog-cart. But I don't <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> as I used to feel," [...] she continued, a little {{hardness}} coming into her face. [...] "I am settled now just the same as if I were married, and father and Edith Malcolmsen may come just as soon as they please. They shall make no plans for me; I am going to stay here with Uncle John. This house is mine now, and I am seriously thinking of having it painted. I shall stay here just as if I were one of those trees, and my father and my new mother--" ...|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT. I don't <b>feel</b> so sure <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> He's {{capable of}} anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{already begun}} to <b>feel</b> curious <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bird of yours," [...] I said, {{addressing}} the sweep. [...] "I'd like very much to hear his history. Did you take him from the nest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Marco, there's {{another thing}} which you must permit--out of {{kindness}} for Jones--because you wouldn't {{want to offend}} him. He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but he is so diffident he couldn't venture it himself, and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him--you know how a delicate person <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing --and so I said I would, and we would keep mum. Well, his idea was, a new outfit of clothes for you both--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm half-feminine, I believe," [...] he said. [...] "For instance, I've {{got just}} a woman's joy in textures and little {{significant}} shapes. I {{know how you}} <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I can spend hours, even now, in crystal gazing--I don't mean to see some silly revelation of some silly person's proceedings somewhere, but just for the things themselves. I wonder if you have ever been in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, and looked at Ruskin's crystal collection? I saw it when I was a boy, and it became--I can't help the word--an obsession. The inclusions like moss and like trees, {{and all sorts of}} fantastic things, and the cleavages and enclosures with little bubbles, and the lights and shimmer--What were we talking about? Oh, about the keen way your feminine perceptions cut into things. And yet somehow I was throwing contempt on the feminine intelligence. I don't do justice to the order of my thoughts. Never mind. We've lost the thread. But I wish you knew my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all true," [...] said Mrs. Quack, [...] "and those hunters {{do other}} things just as unfair. Sometimes awful storms will come up, and {{we just have to}} find places where we can rest. Those hunters will hide near those places and shoot at us when we are so tired that we can hardly move a wing. It wouldn't be so bad if a hunter would be {{satisfied}} to kill just one Duck, just as Reddy Fox is, but he seems to want to kill EVERY Duck. Foxes and Hawks and Owls catch a good many young Ducks, just as they do young Rabbits, but you know how we <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> They only hunt when they are hungry, and they hunt fairly. When, they have got enough to make a dinner, they stop. They keep our wits sharp. If we do not keep out of their way, it is our own fault. It is a kind of game--the game of life. I guess it is Old Mother Nature's way of keeping us wide-awake and sharpening our wits, and so making us better fitted to live.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} sleep," [...] he wrote, [...] "on {{account of this}} man and his talk and the streak of hatred in his talk. He distressed me not because he seemed exceptional, but because he seemed ordinary. I {{realized}} that he was more human than I was, and that only killing and killing could come out of such humanity. I thought of the great ugly guns I had seen, and of the still greater guns he had talked about, and how gloatingly he thought of the destruction they could do. I felt as I used to <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> infernal stallion that had killed a man with its teeth and feet, a despairing fear, a sense of monstrosity in life. And this creature who had so disturbed me was only a beastly snuffy little man in an ill-fitting frock-coat, who laid his knife and fork by their tips {{on the edge of his}} plate, and picked his teeth with gusto and breathed into my face as he talked to me. The commonest of representative men. I went about that Westphalian country after that, with the conviction that headless, soulless, blood-drinking metal monsters were breeding all about me. I felt that science was producing a poisonous swarm, a nest of black dragons. They were crouching here and away there in France and England, they were crouching like beasts that bide their time, mewed up in forts, kennelled in arsenals, hooded in tarpaulins as hawks are hooded.... And I had never thought very much about them before, and there they were, waiting until some human fool like that frock-coated thing of spite, and fools like him multiplied by a million, saw fit to call them out to action. Just out of hatred and nationalism and faction...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, do {{you stay}} where you are, while I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> for <b>that</b> spear head I put in to mark the place. It had about three feet of the staff on it. If {{it were not for}} that, there would be small chance of finding it. I know it is somewhere close here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, it is ugly {{when you}} look at it," [...] said one to me, as we stood {{surveying}} it from the centre of the room. [...] "But what one <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> it is <b>that</b> one has done it oneself." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the title}} of the episode, Bell said [...] "I think for all of us, “who you really are” is {{revealed}} in these kind of situations. Which side are you on, how do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> who do you stand with, how do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> So very much on point with that is Lady Sif, {{and one of the things}} on point with that is Skye, but one of the things that I think is nice about that title is it also reflects on the rest of the team as well." ...|$|E
5000|$|John Smith is {{a decent}} man who earned his {{education}} {{in the field and}} stands up for worker rights. Mary Jones received her undergraduate degree at Yale, and a law degree at Northwestern. She advocates eating vegetables. How do you <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Concerning Simmons' {{apparent}} {{anger at}} learning that Skye has gained new abilities {{due to her}} exposure to alien materials, executive producer Jeffrey Bell explained that [...] "The way everyone reacts to the situation is different, and different types of concern and different types of fear, and different types of determination…and I think all of our characters are reacting {{in very different ways}} to that, which is the whole point of doing it. When one of your best friends comes out as a superhero, {{how do you react to}} that? And just trying to find out, “Oh, my friend changed, they’re different, and how do I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> And this is cool, but it’s scary, and I don’t know how I <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And it’s wonderful, and why can’t I have that? Or, I don’t want that. Or, does Skye want that?” It just, to me, captures a whole bunch of questions, which is what we try to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we can't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> you," [...] said Hans, with {{a devout}} look. [...] "What does it signify whether a perfect {{woman is a}} Jewess or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, snuffledo! {{and break}} your heart, you poor thing. Somebody fetch this sick doll a sugar-rag. Look you, Sir Jean de Metz, do you <b>feel</b> {{absolutely}} certain <b>about</b> <b>that</b> thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>feel</b> {{quite easy}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fellow Gaspard. He seems a sulky dog, and {{is such a}} Hercules that he might give us a deal of trouble if he were high-spirited." ...|$|R
50|$|Whereas, {{off-line}} {{reputation management}} {{refers to the}} process of managing public perception of a said entity out-side the digital sphere using select clearly defined controls and measures towards a desired result ideally representing what stake-holders think and <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> entity. Wherein, the most popular controls for off-line reputation management include social responsibility, media visibility, press releases in print media and sponsorship amongst related tools.|$|E
50|$|The {{methods of}} neuro-linguistic {{programming}} are the specific techniques used to perform and teach neuro-linguistic programming, a pseudoscience which teaches {{that people are}} only able to directly perceive {{a small part of}} the world using their conscious awareness, and that this view of the world is filtered by experience, beliefs, values, assumptions, and biological sensory systems. NLP argues that people act and feel based on their perception of the world and how they <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> world they subjectively experience.|$|E
