5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett.

5|$|As {{with all}} the songs on Biophilia, an app was made for the song, which {{features}} a video game in which the player have to move geological layers as an accordion to play chords. Though the song wasn't released as a single, a music video was produced, directed by Andrew Thomas Huang. The video was critically applauded and received further attention when <b>it</b> <b>got</b> projected for one month in Times Square in 2013, and then across the 7 continents.

5|$|By the 21st century, Highway 82 {{had grown}} to four lanes. It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the {{congestion}} that developed when <b>it</b> <b>got</b> there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county. In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after considering all the proposals and taking public input, released a Record of Decision. The preferred alternative combined highway and intersection improvements, mass transit and incremental transportation management.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so <b>it</b> <b>got</b> little attention in the United States.

Their {{trenches}} stretched from the sea to Walkers Ridge and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post.

Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left. However, the regiment {{had to wait until}} <b>it</b> <b>got</b> dark before sending men forward to man the two outposts.|$|E

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and <b>it</b> <b>got</b> 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as <b>it</b> <b>got</b> older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E

The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E

It returned later in the night with 3.59m. The episode of The X Factor broadcast between the two episodes received a higher number of viewers, attracting 8.08m.

5|$|State Highway 34 {{was first}} {{designated}} on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway {{began at the}} free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 {{to the point that}} is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until <b>it</b> <b>got</b> to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.|$|E
