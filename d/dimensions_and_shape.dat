25|$|Users access Virtual Cell as a {{distributed}} application over the Internet. The web-based Java interface {{allows users to}} build complex models in biologically relevant terms: compartment <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape,</b> molecular characteristics, and interaction parameters. VCell converts the biological description into an equivalent mathematical system of differential equations. Users can switch back-and-forth between the schematic biological view and the mathematical view in the common graphical interface. Indeed, if users desire, they can manipulate the mathematical description directly, bypassing the schematic view. VCell allows users a choice of numerical solvers to translate the mathematical description into software code which is executed to perform the simulations. The results can be displayed on-line, or they can be downloaded to the user's computer {{in a wide variety}} of export formats. The Virtual Cell license allows free access to all members of the scientific community.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{the design}} for the United States ten-dollar bill, Ten Dollar Bill {{measures}} , and is drawn on sheets of paper with dimensions of [...] Classified as a proto-pop art work, the lithograph is considered by Janis Hendrickson to be [...] "a Picasso-esque vision of what currency could look like", {{as well as a}} [...] "humorous" [...] combination of [...] "established art forms and Americana". The drawing has the <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the ten-dollar bill, and completely covers the space needed, which has led to Lichtenstein being considered by Hendrickson as [...] "almost seeming to be forging money". Hendrickson also describes the picture as being a [...] "brand-new bill of tender and not a picture of one". Mary Lee Corlett and Hendrickson noted that the [...] "schematic head" [...] of the medallion portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the prominent feature of the print, [...] "shows him as a planar, anteater-like being" [...] with a [...] "hair-do of the young Picasso" [...] and eyes similar to a [...] "figure by Francis Picabia". According to Hendrickson, the exterior framing for The Dollar Bill was [...] "simplified" [...] from the original dollar design, appearing in [...] "an imbalanced, drunken fashion". The lithograph has full margins surrounding the main design, as well as the signature [...] "rf Lichtenstein" [...] and a number between one and 25, followed by /25, reflecting the print number of the specific work, as well as the years 1956/79.|$|E

In laboratory it requires days of testing time. For fine-grained clays, it may last for a couple of months using pressure plate tests. In this study, the effects of sample <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using pressure plate tests <b>and</b> the <b>shape</b> of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of pressure plate tests and microstructure of the sample. Based on the above findings, it is found that the circular samples with smaller dimensions can accelerate the testing duration of SWCC using the pressure plate...|$|R

The potential effect of parity may be via stretching and elongation of the birth canal at the time of vaginal birth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-Designing an {{architecture}} to handle large conceptual data blocks {{is very much}} needed. This paper implements {{a model for the}} <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> <b>dimension</b> invariant programming of arrays based on the notation of the Mathematics of Arrays (MOA) algebra. It focuses on <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> invariance <b>and</b> their effect in parallel computing. The MOA algebra is implemeted as a library of APIs, that contains object oriented classes implemented in C++. The APIs reduce the erroneous loops starts, strides, and stops used by programmers in the traditional models of handling multi-dimension arrays. The library defines the <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the arrays at runtime, and gives the code of the problem at hand better chances to be automatically parallelized. An imageprocessing tool is implemented using the new MOA library, proving the correctness and effecicy of the model. Some video processing operations such as transformation of AVI frames and motion detection schemes are implemented using the MOA library. The parallelization factors inherent in the MOA implementation are demonstrated in terms of shape polymorphism, MOA parallel architecture, data redistribution, and tiling algorithms. Furthermore, pipelining MOA computations has also been demonstrated...|$|R
