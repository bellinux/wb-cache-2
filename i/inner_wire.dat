50|$|There are two {{different}} types of die tooling used for coating over a wire, tubing (or jacketing) and pressure. In jacketing tooling, the polymer melt does not touch the <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> until immediately before the die lips. In pressure tooling, the melt contacts the <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> long before it reaches the die lips; this is done at a high pressure to ensure good adhesion of the melt. If intimate contact or adhesion is required between the new layer and existing wire, pressure tooling is used. If adhesion is not desired/necessary, jacketing tooling is used instead.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{controversy}} surrounding {{the existence of}} the phenomenon known as [...] "cable stretch". Newly installed cables can seem to elongate, requiring readjustment. While it is generally agreed that <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> actually stretch very little - if at all - housings and linings may compress slightly, and all parts may generally [...] "settle in". Lightweight assemblies such as those used on bicycles are more susceptible to this phenomenon.|$|R

50|$|The {{insulator}} {{surrounding the}} inner conductor may be solid plastic, a foam plastic, or air with spacers supporting the <b>inner</b> <b>wire.</b> The {{properties of the}} dielectric insulator determine some of the electrical properties of the cable. A common choice is a solid polyethylene (PE) insulator, used in lower-loss cables. Solid Teflon (PTFE) is also used as an insulator. Some coaxial lines use air (or some other gas) and have spacers to keep the inner conductor from touching the shield.|$|E
5000|$|Vaaler's patents expired quietly, {{while the}} [...] "Gem" [...] was used worldwide, {{including}} his own country. The failure of his design was its impracticality. Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, {{it was difficult to}} insert sheets of paper into his clip. One could manipulate the end of the <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle. The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper. The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.|$|E

The appearances and metallographic structures of conductors in service are examined and their mechanical property indicators are analyzed. Based on the corrosion mechanism of aluminum and galvanized steel wires, the research on the corrosion of ACSR which has run for years concludes that the outer aluminum wires of the 220 kV old conductors that have operated for years are more corroded than the <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> and the resistivity exceeds the standards {{although there is no}} significant drop in the mechanical indicators. The results in this research can provide technical support and guidance for the life evaluation of old transmission lines in the country. ...|$|R

50|$|Although the {{individual}} parts for cable assembly can be acquired, ready-made cables for both brakes and shifting are available. These usually consist of an <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> within {{a length of}} housing, and depending on their purpose, {{with one or more}} end caps fitted. However, because of the wide range of fittings in use, it is probable that these universal cables' caps, although suiting many situations, will not suit every purpose, as their name wrongly implies. The shortening of housings requires the use of a special hand tool, designed to make a square cut without closing the cable entry. The same tool is used to cut the internal steel cable. To avoid unraveling of the cable's wires during installation, manufacturers weld or crimp the ends.|$|E
5000|$|The wire ropes are {{stressed}} by fluctuating forces, by wear, by corrosion and in seldom cases by extreme forces. The rope life is finite {{and the safety}} is only ensured by inspection {{for the detection of}} wire breaks on a reference rope length, of cross-section loss, as well as other failures so that the wire rope can be replaced before a dangerous situation occurs. Installations should be designed to facilitate the inspection of the wire ropes. [...] Lifting installations for passenger transportation require that a combination of several methods should be used to prevent a car from plunging downwards. Elevators must have redundant bearing ropes and a safety gear. Ropeways and mine hoistings must be permanently supervised by a responsible manager and the rope must be inspected by a magnetic method capable of detecting <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> breaks.|$|E
50|$|The Maryland crab pot is an {{enclosed}} framework of wire with four openings. These openings are constructed {{so that when}} the crabs enter to eat the bait, they cannot escape, and instead become immediately trapped. Once the crab becomes trapped and cannot leave the same way they entered, they float upward and go through the openings of the <b>inner</b> <b>wire</b> portion, which permanently traps the crab. The Maryland crab pot is a cube, generally two cubic feet and when baited and weighted, might weigh fifteen pounds or more. Sometimes it is left on the bottom for twelve to twenty-four hours or more. The end of the nylon rope is attached to a marked floating buoy so the location can be found and the pot retrieved. The Maryland crab pot is baited from the bottom with several oily fish. This is done by turning the pot on its side, stuffing the bait into the wire container, and closing the opening by securing the flap under the rubber tubing. The pot is then dropped into the water and when the crab fisher returns, pulls the pot up and into their boat.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to create a finite element model for detailed three-dimensional stress analysis of an overhead optical ground wire (OPGW) typical of those used in transmission lines. The detailed model considers all possible mechanical effects, such as contact, friction, elongation, torsion, and bending for different end conditions. The OPGW under study comprises four components: the external layer of fourteen aluminum alloy <b>wires</b> and ten <b>inner</b> aluminum clad steel wires, which are laid over an aluminum tube that houses a five-groove aluminum spacer. The optical fiber units are inserted in the aluminum spacer grooves. Three-dimensional solid elements are used to model the outer <b>wires,</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>wires,</b> and the aluminum spacer. The central aluminum tube is modeled with shell elements with large strain and deformation kinematics. All possible contacts between the components, with and without friction, are considered in the model. The OPGW is assumed fixed at one end and pulled from the other with a prescribed displacement equivalent to the experimental elongation of 0. 61 % defined for all components. The finite element analysis predicts that the responses of the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> are in the linear range, however the aluminum tube and spacer are yielded under the prescribed displacement. Therefore, a multilinear stress-strain law is used in the model. Two scenarios of loading were tested to apply the axial elongation on the wires; either only the central node or all the interior nodes of the wire cross sections are prescribed a maximum axial displacement. Results of the finite element model are compared with those of the experiments performed at IREQ and with the analytical solutions of Machida and Durelli (1973) and Phillips and Costello (1973). The calculated axial forces of the cable in the coarse and fine mesh models are 61 % and 70 % of those predicted by the analytical solutions, respectively. However, the differences in stresses and strains of the coarse mesh model are in the range of ten percent only from the theoretical solutions. The effective modulus of elasticity of the finite element model increases with tension. For the maximum elongation, the effective modulus obtained with the coarse and fine mesh models is 62 % and 70 % respectively of the equivalent modulus of elasticity calculated neglecting all three-dimensional effects. This study shows the reliability and significance of using finite element modeling in predicting the detailed response of a complex cable, for which experiments and theoretical solutions are unable to yield complete results.

5000|$|A {{pipe cleaner}} {{is made of}} two lengths of wire, called the core, twisted {{together}} trapping short lengths of fibre between them, called the pile. Pipe cleaners are usually made two at a time, as the <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> of each pipe cleaner have the yarn wrapped around them, making a coil, the outer wires trap the wraps of yarn, which are then cut, making the tufts. Chenille yarn is made {{in much the same}} way, which is why craft pipe cleaners are often called [...] "chenille stems". The word chenille comes from French meaning caterpillar. Some pipe cleaner machines are actually converted chenille machines. Some machines produce very long pipe cleaners which are wound onto spools. The spools may be sold as-is or cut to length depending on the intended use. Other machines cut the pipe cleaners to length as they come off the machines. Smoking pipe cleaners are usually 15 - 17 cm (6 - 7 inches) long. Craft ones are often 30 cm (12 inches) and can be up to 50 cm (20 inches).The diameter comes in 4 mm; 6 mm; and 15 mm sizes Jumbo pipe cleaners have a 30 mm diameter with lengths of 18 inches and 6.5 feet.|$|R

As with any {{political}} action like this there are difficulties getting to the truth, with reports taking sides. It is possible that there were as many as 2000 protesters, a minimum of 500. They claim to have followed police directions, and that the police reacted with unnecessary violence. It is clear that there were around 200 police sent to protect the center, who erected plastic barricades at some distance from it to prevent access. They fired teargas at protesters, which drifted back into the center. Protesters also claim that the police ran into them with their vehicles. The inner fence was breached in several places and the protesters deemed the protest a symbolic success.

Nickel–zinc ferrite (Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4) nanowire-in-nanotubes have been prepared as a demonstration. The detailed nanoscale characterization, formation process and magnetic properties of Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanowire-in-nanotubes has been studied comprehensively. The average diameters of the outer tubes and <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> of Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanowire-in-nanotubes are around 120 nm and 42 nm, respectively. Each fully calcined individual nanowire-in-nanotube, either the outer-tube or the inner-wire, is composed of Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 monocrystallites stacked along the longitudinal direction with random orientation. The process of calcining electrospun polymer composite nanofibres {{can be viewed as}} a morphologically template nucleation and precursor diffusion process. This allows the nitrates precursor to diffuse toward the surface of the nanofibres while the oxides (decomposed from hydroxides and nitrates) products diffuse to the core region of the nanofibres; the amorphous nanofibres transforming thereby into crystalline nanowire-in-nanotubes. In addition, the magnetic properties of the Ni 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 Fe 2 O 4 nanowire-in-nanotubes were also examined. It is believed that this nanowire-in-nanotube (sometimes called core–shell) structure, with its uniform size and well-controlled orientation of the long nanowire-in-nanotubes, is particularly attractive for use in the field of nano-fluidic devices and nano-energy harvesting devices...|$|R

50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the <b>inner</b> <b>wires</b> much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary lay rope if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|R
