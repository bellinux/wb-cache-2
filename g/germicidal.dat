25|$|A UVGI {{system is}} {{designed}} to expose environments such as water tanks, sealed rooms and forced air systems to <b>germicidal</b> UV. Exposure comes from <b>germicidal</b> lamps that emit <b>germicidal</b> UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.|$|E
25|$|Dust {{and films}} coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require {{periodic}} cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of <b>germicidal</b> UV bulbs {{varies depending on}} design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the <b>germicidal</b> rays.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, {{household}} {{clothes dryers}} sometimes incorporated a <b>germicidal</b> lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the <b>germicidal</b> lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240V countries was a circleline tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet lamps {{are used}} to {{sterilize}} workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. Commercially available low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265nm being the peak <b>germicidal</b> effectiveness curve. UV at these <b>germicidal</b> wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA so that it cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only {{as a supplement to}} other sterilization techniques.|$|E
25|$|Extra equipment, {{such as a}} {{first aid}} kit (including a pocket mask, {{disposable}} gloves, <b>germicidal</b> wipes, hypoallergenic tape, wound dressings, a triangular bandage, and sterile plasters), may be stored in a patrol car.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>germicidal</b> UV {{depends on the}} length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism’s ability to withstand UV during its exposure.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet <b>germicidal</b> {{irradiation}} (UVGI) is a disinfection {{method that}} uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light {{to kill or}} inactivate microorganisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions. UVGI is used {{in a variety of}} applications, such as food, air, and water purification.|$|E
25|$|High-frequency {{treatment}} uses low-current high-frequency alternating currents, delivered via a glass electrode. Because {{the high}} frequency current converts {{some of the}} oxygen in the air into ozone, the treatment has a <b>germicidal</b> action, and is also drying and warming. Consequently, the treatment is used to aid healing and also to help desquamation (the skin's natural exfoliation) and stimulate sweat and sebaceous glands.|$|E
25|$|The flow {{profile is}} {{produced}} from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs {{such as water}} quality, lamp type (power, <b>germicidal</b> efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light {{irradiation}} (UV, from a <b>germicidal</b> lamp) {{is useful for}} sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, {{so that it is}} very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as polystyrene foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, <b>germicidal</b> lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. <b>Germicidal</b> lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas discharge lamps rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM erasers. <b>Germicidal</b> lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning <b>germicidal),</b> rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long <b>germicidal</b> lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Germicidal</b> UV for {{disinfection}} is most typically {{generated by}} a mercury-vapor lamp. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254nm, which is {{within the range of}} wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect. [...] The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270nm.|$|E
2500|$|For human beings, skin {{exposure}} to <b>germicidal</b> wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and skin cancer. Exposure {{of the eyes}} to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the cornea and temporary or permanent vision impairment, {{up to and including}} blindness in some cases. [...] UV can damage the retina of the eye.|$|E
2500|$|These {{calculations}} actually {{predict the}} [...] {{and it is}} assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of <b>germicidal</b> UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed biofilm a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.|$|E
2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet <b>germicidal</b> irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|Ultraviolet C or (UVC) range, which spans a {{range of}} 100 to 280 nm. The term {{ultraviolet}} refers {{to the fact that}} the radiation is at higher frequency than violet light (and, hence, also invisible to the human eye).

In addition, rather than being made of ordinary borosilicate glass, the tube is made of fused quartz. These two changes combine to allow the 253.7 nm ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc to pass out of the lamp unmodified (whereas, in common fluorescent lamps, it causes the phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light). <b>Germicidal</b> lamps still produce a small amount of visible light due to other mercury radiation bands.|$|E
