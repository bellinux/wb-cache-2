5|$|The real Brian <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{home but}} Stewie {{admits that he}} already gambled away their return tickets. Brian admits that he cannot call for help after taking money from Lois. Using money they got from a loan shark, they bet on a {{basketball}} game and lose yet again. Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the real Stewie takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money.|$|E
25|$|This method {{produces}} the clear plastic blank {{part of the}} disc. After a metallic reflecting layer (usually aluminium, but sometimes gold or other metal) {{is applied to the}} clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a CD writer. The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.|$|E
25|$|Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams {{are married}} {{and the parents}} of twin girls. They live at Ashgrove Cottage on his half-pay, not enough to support fellow navy men in the household. Sophia's mother lost her money, {{including}} Sophia's portion, and now lives with them. They have Cecelia, Sophia's young niece in their household as well. As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to sea again. Stephen Maturin comes to call, and soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, he picks up orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey time to bring {{the crew of the}} Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop strategies.|$|E

500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training {{with the help}} of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a back support belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, [...] "I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that we all had a hard time keeping a straight face through." [...] It was a reference to the episode [...] "The Stakeout", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, [...] "The idea [...] that Ron has the belt in his car trunk and <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{reveals that}} he wants her {{to go with him}} and another woman to Utah (where {{polygamy}} is legal) so they can marry and support him while he writes. After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing. When she looks at the stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles). She then goes to Richard to say goodbye, saying she wants to stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated. Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday. After her grandparents tell her that her grandmother can see the future, she tells them her story. Her grandfather and his lodge friends then try a strange séance ritual to send her back to 1985.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen to me." [...] She bent down, the gun {{pointed at}} his face. [...] "I have to hurry. There isn't much time left. The ship <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{but you must}} tell me the {{information}} I need before I leave." ...|$|E
60|$|The reply {{which the}} monkey made to {{this was to}} nestle his head closer under Toby's coat, and to show, in the most decided manner, that he <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|R

60|$|Now {{the master}} has set every thing to rights, and <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home to dinner. Yet he goes reluctantly. The old man has {{spent so much}} of his life in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room, that, when he has a holiday, he feels as if his place were lost, and himself a {{stranger}} in the world. But, forth he goes; and there stands our old chair, vacant and solitary, till good Master Cheever resumes his seat in it to-morrow morning.|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} seen my aunt in such state. She is dressed in lavender-coloured silk, and has a white bonnet on, and is amazing. Janet has dressed her, and is there to look at me. Peggotty <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to church, {{intending}} to behold the ceremony from the gallery. Mr. Dick, who is to give my darling {{to me at the}} altar, has had his hair curled. Traddles, whom I have taken up by appointment at the turnpike, presents a dazzling combination of cream colour and light blue; and both he and Mr. Dick have a general effect about them of being all gloves.|$|E

6000|$|... "She is a brave girl," [...] Akim said. [...] "I {{think the}} women make better conspirators than we do, Petroff. Look at her. She {{was a little}} serious to-day because of Michaelovich, but {{generally}} she is in high spirits, {{and no one would}} dream that she thought of anything but her pupils and pleasure. Then there is Feodorina Samuloff. She works all day, I believe, in a laundry, and she looks as impassive {{as if she had been}} carved out of soap. Yet she <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on working all night if required, and if she had orders she would walk into the Winter Palace and throw down a bomb (that would kill her as well as everyone else within its reach) with as much coolness as if she was merely delivering a message." ...|$|E
60|$|The scab is {{powerless}} under terrorism. As a rule, {{he is not}} so good nor gritty a man as the men he is displacing, and {{he lacks}} their fighting organization. He stands {{in dire need of}} stiffening and backing. His employers, the capitalists, draw their two remaining weapons, the ownership of which is debatable, but which they for the time being happen to control. These two weapons may be called the political and judicial machinery of society. When the scab crumples up and <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down before the fists, bricks, and bullets of the labor group, the capitalist group puts the police and soldiers into the field, and begins a general bombardment of injunctions. Victory usually follows, for the labor group cannot withstand the combined assault of gatling guns and injunctions.|$|E
6000|$|Now Mary may, perhaps, be in time induced to obey more {{promptly}} {{under this}} management, {{but she will}} have no heart in making the improvement, and she will advance reluctantly and slowly, if at all. But if, at {{the first time that}} she comes promptly, and then, after doing the errand, <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to her play, her mother says, [...] "You left your play and came at once when I called you. That was right. It pleases me very much to find that I can depend upon your being so prompt, even when you are at play," [...] Mary will go back to her play pleased and happy; and the tendency of the incident will be to cause her to feel a spontaneous and cordial interest in the principle of prompt obedience in time to come.|$|E

6000|$|The {{imperious}} {{young lady}} regrets {{that she has}} hurt his feelings, and is rewarded for the apology by receiving news of the most gratifying kind. Faithful Philip has told his father that he is {{engaged to be married}} to Miss Helena Gracedieu, daughter of the celebrated Congregational preacher--and so on, and so on. Has Mr. Dunboyne the elder expressed any objection to the young lady? Certainly not! He knows nothing of the other engagement to Eunice; and he merely objects, on principle, to looking forward. [...] "How do we know," [...] says the philosopher, [...] "what accidents may happen, or what doubts and hesitations may yet turn up? I am not to burden my mind in this matter, till I know that I must do it. Let me hear when she <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to church, and I will be ready with the settlements. My compliments to Miss and her papa, and let us wait a little." [...] Dearest Helena--isn't he funny? ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{a curious}} thing that, when a man hates or loves beyond reason, he <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond reason to gratify his feelings. Which he would not do for money or power merely. Depend upon it, Solomon would never have built altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names, if {{there had not been}} trouble of some kind in his zenana, and nowhere else. But this is beside the story. The facts of the case are these: Pack called on Churton next day when Churton was out, left his card, and STOLE the Bisara of Pooree from its place under the clock on the mantelpiece! Stole it like the thief he was by nature. Three days later, all Simla was {{electrified}} by the news that Miss Hollis had accepted Pack--the shrivelled rat, Pack! Do you desire clearer evidence than this? The Bisara of Pooree had been stolen, and it worked as it had always done when won by foul means.|$|E

"Wall, {{if you put}} it in that way, I don't {{see that}} we can say no, mate," [...] Abe said, [...] "though we are well content with our look-out, I can tell you, and could get a biggish sum for our claims to-night if we were {{disposed}} to sell them. Still, what you says is true, though it isn't every one who makes a good thing out of a bargain as <b>is</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond it. It was a fortunate day for you may be that you fell in with my mate here, and it was a fortunate day for us when he fell in with you. When I goes back east and settles down on a farm I has got my eyes on, I shall always say as I owed my luck to my mate strolling over to talk to the two men as was working what seemed a hopeless claim in Cedar Camp.|$|E
