50|$|The {{plant is}} {{attractive}} to butterflies. Other insects associated with it include the delphacid planthopper Pissonotus quadripustulatus, aphids of the genus Uroleucon (formerly Dactynotus), the leafhopper Carneocephala floridana, and the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae. P. quadripustulatus and A. borrichiae specialize on this plant. The midge causes the development of galls in the apical meristem. <b>Destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissue</b> {{in this part of}} the plant can stop its growth, prevent its flowering, and kill the whole stem. There is usually one gall per plant, but each may have several chambers, usually no more than three, but sometimes up to eight. Each contains a fly larva which feeds on fungus growing inside the gall, then pupates and emerges as an adult. The galls also contain several species of wasps, which are parasitoids on the fly.|$|E
50|$|The {{healing of}} injured tissue {{involves}} a complex series of natural processes within the body. Growth factors {{play a key}} role in this respect, as they initiate and regulate these complex processes. Many of these growth factors are released by thrombocytes that are contained in the blood and activated in the event of injury. As injury or inflammation involves the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissue</b> or cells, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are released. These are involved in cellular processes that promote healing and are associated with tissue growth. Accordingly, they initiate the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types (such as osteoblasts and chondroblasts), promote matrix formation through the production of collagen and proteoglycan, and stimulate angiogenesis. This is in contrast to the immune response that is regulated by leukocytes/neutrophils and involved in the reduction of damaged tissue, and that counteracts possible infection with free radicals (Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS), proteases and antimicrobial peptides. However, these have the biological potential to also damage healthy tissue. By adding ACP at the treatment site, an increased concentration of thrombocytes (2 - 3 times higher than that of whole blood) is applied with neutrophils almost entirely absent. This supports the natural process of healing within the body, i.e. the formation of blood vessels, new cells and tissue, while inhibiting painful inflammation.|$|E

40|$|A 24 -kDa protein was {{isolated}} from the outer membrane vesicles of Porphyromaonas gingivalis W 50.

30|$|So far, {{extremity}} ischemia {{and subsequent}} neovascularization-guided perfusion recovery in animal models {{has often been}} evaluated by predominantly anatomic (MRI), invasive (angiography), or limited (LDPI) techniques. Moreover, accurate documentation of tissue ischemia and perfusion recovery by means of histology requires the collection, and often the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>tissue</b> samples, thereby providing limited clinical relevance and prohibiting serial monitoring of the biologic processes in living animals [26]. Nuclear perfusion and myocyte damage imaging might provide a useful and non-invasive alternative to evaluate serial changes in tissue perfusion.
