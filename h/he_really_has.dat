500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{followed}} the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, {{the first in the}} series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his time, Miller {{was known}} for his {{dishonesty}} and womanizing. His friend and contemporary Ambrose Bierce said of him, [...] "In impugning Mr. Miller's veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be sorry to be understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has.</b> He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Reuters, {{the film}} debuted at No. 3 {{on its first}} weekend at the UK box office. The film debuted at No. 2 in both France and Italy, {{generating}} the year's third-best box office return on an opening weekend in Italy. Said Roberto Proia, distribution chief of the film's Italian distributor Moviemax, about its surprisingly warm reception, [...] "Almost two years after his death, Ledger has a huge fanbase which, {{along with the rest}} of the stellar cast, certainly contributed hugely. [...] We also found out that teenagers massively love Gilliam, and we did not expect this. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> rock star status." [...] Eventually, the film had earned about $54,119,168 theatrically in the countries outside North America.|$|E
2500|$|Discovering clues {{found on}} the wreck, Pitt follows the {{evidence}} to retired Admiral Walter Bass, United States Navy, who was the commander who ordered [...] "Vixen 03" [...] on its top-secret mission. Bass first denies any knowledge of the aircraft, but after Pitt convinces him that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> found the wreck, the admiral reveals that it was carrying a cargo of 16-inch battleship shells loaded with a deadly biological doomsday organism. The organism, nicknamed QD for quick death, is a virulent bacterial weapon that causes nearly instant death. The agent is described as being so deadly that just five ounces (143 ml) air-dropped over Manhattan Island would kill 98% of all human life and, because the strain actually grows stronger over time, would render the island uninhabitable for up to 300 years.|$|E
2500|$|In Oklahoma {{territory}} in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain {{looks forward to}} the beautiful day ahead as he wanders into farm girl Laurey Williams's yard ("Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'"). [...] He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women {{to raise funds for}} a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat the lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long. [...] He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy ("The Surrey with the Fringe on Top"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> rented such a rig.|$|E
6000|$|... "Porverino!" [...] sighed {{the little}} voice, full of pity; and, in a moment, three red-and-yellow tulips fell at Johnny's feet, making him {{feel as if}} <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> slipped into fairy-land through that {{delightful}} hole.|$|R

2500|$|Basil usually {{turns to}} Manuel or Polly {{to help him}} with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from {{discovering}} them. However, Basil occasionally laments for the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, [...] "The Anniversary", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party [...] involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything though he pretends to have a stab at it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the Battle of Agincourt, for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is out of earshot, and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the Battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur, just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> forgotten, and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).|$|E

6000|$|A {{note was}} sent to Mr. Clemens asking him if the letter was genuine and whether <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a {{typewriter}} {{as long ago as}} that. Mr. Clemens replied that his best answer is the following chapter from his unpublished autobiography: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{scene was}} so exciting, and {{his efforts to}} stick to the narrow seat so great, that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no time to attend to the homesick feeling that had crept over him during {{the first part of the}} evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--hardly that, I think. The man {{is both a}} fool and a blackguard; but I don't {{think we}} are {{therefore}} to suppose {{that there are many}} fools and blackguards like him. I wonder what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will call}} him, Jack," [...] Mrs. Anthony said. [...] "You have no ill feeling, I hope, toward him, for you know <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> been very {{sorry about the}} part he took in getting you away, and has blamed himself over and over again." ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> {{something}} to say, however, about something he knows and loves, {{he is in}} the best possible case to say it well. Still, from time to time he may advantageously call a halt, and consider whether he is saying the thing clearly and simply.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll come," [...] said Ben, decidedly, for he {{had already}} {{made up his mind}} that he should accept the proposition. Then he led the others away very quickly, as if he had some plan in his mind, as, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{assistant}} complied, and the Jew, {{after sitting}} {{down a little}} while to persuade himself that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> no particular interest in the matter, rose and went slowly upstairs.

6000|$|He {{came back}} at dinner-time, red and glowing, to tell Thomas Idle {{what he had}} seen. Thomas, on his back reading, listened with great composure, and asked him whether <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> gone up those hills, and bothered himself with those views, and walked all those miles? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{had better}} take the bull by the horns," [...] he said, [...] "and do it myself. Then I shall {{find out whether}} <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> our {{interest}} at heart, or whether he looks on you as a stranger because you've gone away from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{gentleman who}} made this charge," [...] I went on, [...] "seems {{to me to be}} in a very {{uncertain}} condition.

60|$|I don't {{know whether}} {{you may have heard}} from Webster, or whether the {{impression}} I derived from Mark's manner on Friday may be altogether correct.
