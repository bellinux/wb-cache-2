The rate of acid neutralization was dependent on stack flow rate and increased 50 × (from 0. 06 ± 0. 04 to 3. 0 ± 0. 32 pH units min - 1 m- 2 membrane), as the flow rate increased 6 × (from 100 to 600 mL min- 1).

This paper presents a method to develop requirements for the emissivity of a ship's coating that reduces the contrast of the ship against its background in the wavelength band or bands of threat sensors. As this contrast strongly depends on the atmospheric environment, these requirements must follow from a detailed analysis of the infrared signature of the ship in its expected areas of operation. Weather statistics for a large number of areas have been collected to produce a series of 'standard environments'. These environments have been used to demonstrate the method of specifying coating emissivity requirements. Results are presented to show that the optimised coatings reduce the temperature contrast. The use of the standard environments yields a complete, yet concise, description of the signature of the ship over its areas of operation. The signature results illustrate the strong dependence of the infrared signature on the atmospheric environment and can be used to identify those conditions where signature reduction is most effective in reducing the ship's susceptibility to detection by IR sensors...|$|R

Remov-ing upstream ions had no significant influence on the nucleation mode, suggesting that ionic nucleation did not play an important role.

Several methods have been proposed in order to obtain more efficient combustion systems with low pollutant emissions. Over the past few years, a great deal of investigation on combustion in porous medium has been performed. In its efforts to optimize combustion processes, the Institute of Fluid Dynamics in Friedrich-Alexander University, Erlangen (LSTM-Nürnberg/Germany) has succeeded in developing the technology of combustion in porous media and this burner was used in this study. This thesis was focused on the evaluation of the porous burner characteristic diagrams and determined the possibility of the process water production. The experimental works were consisted of two main parts. One of them was carried out at the Institute of Fluid Dynamics in Erlangen. The second was performed at Izmir Institute of Technology.

When a fuel is burnt, water and CO 2 are produced and expelled as part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> In an IBC, in order to reduce compression work, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> are <b>cooled</b> before compression up to ambient pressure. If coolant with a low enough temperature is available, it is possible to condense some of the water out of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> further reducing compressor work. In this study the condensation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> water is studied. The results show that the IBC can produce about 50 kW/kg/s for the conditions investigated. The main factors that influence the power output are heat exchanger pressure drop, turbine expansion ratio and coolant temperature. A lower coolant temperature significantly increases power output, particularly when condensation occurs. Larger turbine expansion ratios produce more power and slightly lower the temperature at which condensation onset occurs. The system is very sensitive to heat exchanger pressure drop, as larger pressure drops increase the compressor pressure ratio whilst leaving the turbine expansion ratio unchanged. Higher turbine inlet pressures can also increase net power, but the higher exhaust backpressures pressures may increase engine pumping losses. Finally, for conditions when condensation is possible, the water content of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> has a significant influence on power output. The hydrogen to carbon ratio of the fuel has the most potential to vary the water content and hence the power generated by the system.

In order to confirm the safety of the EGR cooler, finite element analyses are carried out for each component, such as the oval core tube with a dimpled shape. The structural integrity under thermal stress and pressure, which are caused by gas and coolant flows in the shell and tubes, is evaluated through thermal and structural analyses...|$|R
40|$|An average {{passenger}} car engine effectively uses {{about one-third of}} the fuel combustion energy, while the two-thirds are wasted through <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> and engine <b>cooling.</b> It is of great interest to automotive industry to recover some of this wasted energy, thus increasing the engine efficiency and lowering fuel consumption and contamination. Waste heat recovery for internal combustion engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> using Brayton cycle machine was investigated. The principle problems of application of such a system in a {{passenger car}} were considered: compressor and expander machine selection, machine size for packaging under the hood, efficiency of the cycle, and improvement of engine efficiency. Important parameters of machines design have been determined and analyzed. An average 2 -L turbocharged gasoline engine’s New European Driving Cycle points were taken as inlet points for waste heat recovery system. It is theoretically estimated that the recuperated power of 1515 W can be achieved along with 5. 7 % improvement in engine efficiency, at the point where engine power is 26550 W...|$|R
