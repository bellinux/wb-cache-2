500|$|The Met fans {{began to}} treat him like a folk hero. The New York Post {{described}} him as a [...] "cult hero." [...] Within a month of his debut, {{he had become a}} fan favorite. [...] "I Like Ike" [...] banners began appearing at Citi Field, a phrase once used in the decades-prior presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower. [...] Weeks later, he recalled: [...] I had such nerves the first few days. I didn't even have an approach. It was <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ball, hit the ball. Only now am I settling in, getting the chance to think about how a pitcher is going to approach me.|$|E
500|$|By appearance, {{he is an}} {{overweight}} corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk, but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime, under the moniker of Kingpin. Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and {{the man responsible for}} the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in [...] He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying [...] "they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.' But I want them to get past that and <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> movie for what it is and see me for what I am—an actor." ...|$|E

60|$|Dick's {{heart had}} just been awakened. He had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> cruel {{consequences}} of his own behaviour; {{and the thought of}} the sum of misery that was now acting in the whole of Shoreby filled him with despair.|$|R

50|$|At its accession, Scanlen's new {{government}} confronted two full-blown wars {{and a string}} of smaller conflicts, all caused by Frere's recently failed confederation scheme.

30|$|As <b>just</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>the</b> {{impact of}} higher {{transparency}} on agricultural production depends {{only on the}} curvature of the marginal cost function.

50|$|Marlow's theatre {{production}} of the play was a success and toured widely but the film version had trouble obtaining distribution.

60|$|When {{the various}} cases had been {{examined}} Dr. Tyrell {{went back into}} the large room and sat down again at his desk.

6000|$|Eudena and Ugh-lomi {{stepped back}} from the cliff until they could <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> bears over the verge. Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena pulled his arm, but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her hand dropped. Ugh-lomi stood {{watching}} the bears, with his axe in his hand, until they had vanished into the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at the she-bear's receding quarters. Then to Eudena's terror, instead of creeping off with her, he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a position that he could <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cave. It was bears--and he did it as calmly {{as if it had been}} rabbits he was watching! ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{darkness}} I could <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> thing--like an elephant's trunk {{more than anything}} else--waving towards me and touching and examining the wall, coals, wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro.|$|E
60|$|So he told her, and {{she told}} him of herself, and they talked and talked till the shadows of {{advancing}} night began to close around them. Suddenly Godfrey looked at his watch, of which he could only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} the servant-girl {{announced}} dinner.
