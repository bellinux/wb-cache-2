25|$|Peak {{phosphorus}} is {{a concept}} to describe the point in time at which the maximum global phosphorus production rate is reached. Phosphorus is a scarce <b>finite</b> <b>resource</b> on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle. According to some researchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves {{are expected to be}} completely depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030.|$|E
25|$|The Pebble Mine is a <b>finite</b> <b>resource</b> {{which will}} employ 5,500 people and bring $200 million in tax revenue {{a year to}} the state. Salmon fishing, a {{naturally}} renewable resource each year, employs 12,000 people in the Bristol Bay region alone and contributes $250 million each year to the economy. Many fishermen, environmentalists, naturalists, native Alaskans, residents and nature lovers, among many others, both in Alaska and worldwide, fear that pollution from the mine will destroy the salmon runs as well as the sometimes rare and very diverse wildlife that thrives there.|$|E

25|$|The Barnett formula has {{resulted}} in higher per-capita public spending in Scotland than England. Including an allocation of North Sea oil revenue based on geography, Scotland also produced more per capita tax revenue than the UK average {{in the years immediately}} preceding the referendum. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported in November 2012 that a geographic share of North Sea oil would more than cover the higher public spending, but warned that oil prices are volatile and that they are drawn from a <b>finite</b> <b>resource.</b> The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report for 2012/13 found that North Sea oil revenue had fallen by 41.5% and that Scotland's public spending deficit had increased from £4.6 billion to £8.6 billion.|$|E
25|$|Water, however, {{is not a}} <b>finite</b> <b>resource</b> (meaning the {{availability}} of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking water supply, which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a non-renewable resource, and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.|$|E
25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a <b>finite</b> <b>resource</b> ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E

2500|$|After the War, Schumacher {{worked as}} an {{economic}} advisor to, and later Chief Statistician for, the British Control Commission, which was charged with rebuilding the German economy. From 1950 to 1970 he was Chief Economic Adviser to the National Coal Board, one of the world's largest organisations, with 800,000 employees. In this position, he argued that coal, not petroleum, {{should be used to}} supply the energy needs of the world's population. He saw oil as a <b>finite</b> <b>resource,</b> fearing its depletion and eventually prohibitive price, and viewed with alarm the reality that [...] "the richest and cheapest reserves are located in some of the world's most unstable countries" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hubbert's {{peak oil}} theory {{suggests}} that petroleum is a <b>finite</b> <b>resource</b> that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately [...] (about {{one half of the}} original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of [...] per year, only about 50 years worth of petroleum is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: fuel (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) transportation, agriculture, pharmaceutical, plastics/resins, man-made fibers, synthetic rubber, and explosives. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘peak oil’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021, (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of global warming that may usher in unprecedented climate change.|$|E
