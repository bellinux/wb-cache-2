5|$|In 1242, the {{citizens}} of Tyre offered the barons opposed to Frederick's rule (Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Toron) their assistance against Richard Filangieri, who ruled Tyre on Frederick's behalf. Marsilio Zorzi, the bailli of the Venetian community in the Holy Land offered naval support to the coalition. At {{the request of the}} members of the High Court, Philip of Novara, a noted jurist, stated that Frederick had forfeited his right to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem when his son, Conrad, had reached the age of majority on 25 April 1243. Novara also argued that Alice and her husband were entitled to rule the kingdom as regent for the absent Conrad because she was his closest relative who lived in the Holy Land. The members of the High Court, the representatives of the clergy, the Military Orders and the Italian communities held a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> where Alice and Ralph of Nesle were proclaimed regents on 5 June. She agreed that Balian of Ibelin and Philip of Montfort would keep all royal castles in the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{consists}} of two chambers. It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee {{the activities of the}} President and the Cabinet. The lower chamber is the Chamber of Deputies, which has 80 members serving five-year terms. Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by universal suffrage under a proportional representation system. Following the 2013 election, there are 51 female deputies, up from 45 in 2008; , Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament. The upper chamber is the 26-seat Senate, whose members are selected by a variety of bodies. A mandatory minimum of 30% of the senators are women. Senators serve eight-year terms. (See also Gender equality in Rwanda).|$|E
25|$|AGU holds annual {{meetings}} in San Francisco every December (known as the Fall meeting) and every Spring (April through May) in {{locations around the}} world. The latter grew out of AGU's annual Spring meeting, which had been held {{for many years in}} Baltimore, until declining interest caused AGU to move the meeting to different locations, starting with Boston in 1998. With the 2003 meeting in Nice, France, it became known as the <b>Joint</b> <b>Assembly</b> because AGU co-sponsors it with other societies such as the Geochemical Society, the Mineralogical Society of America (MSA), the Canadian Geophysical Union (CGU), and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The Fall Meeting had more than 20,000 attendees in 2012. Because of renovations at the San Francisco venue, the 2017 meeting will be in New Orleans and the 2018 in Washington, DC.|$|E
40|$|Practice {{shows that}} it is {{necessary}} to control threaded <b>joint’s</b> <b>assembly</b> tightness when mounting or due to the exploitation. If this condition is not provided in necessary quality and tightness is insufficient or too big, it may cause threaded joint’s damage. The most popular methods for the threaded <b>joint’s</b> <b>assembly</b> control in machine manufacturing are as following: 1) measurement of the screw’s prolongation; 2) control of the screw-nut’s turning angle; 3) measurement of the screw-nut’s tightness moment. The most exact results provide the measurement of the screw’s prolongation. This method is widely used when controlling threaded joint’s tightness for very responsible assembly units, for example, for pitman screw joints...|$|R

500|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two Quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems as though this was the first instance of a joint Patricio-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly,</b> there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the leges Valeriae Horatiae), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians. This gave the Plebeian Tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person (intercessio) to veto acts of the senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the [...] "Hortensian Law"), which removed the last check that the Patricians in the senate had over this power.|$|E
500|$|The {{bishop and}} the noblemen {{regarded}} the Kolozsmonostor agreement {{as a temporary}} compromise. They only wanted to prevent the rebels from continuing the fight and to save time to muster new troops. They assembled at Kápolna and started negotiations with the counts of the Székelys and the delegates of the Saxon seats. This was the first occasion when {{the representatives of the}} noblemen, Székelys and Saxons held a <b>joint</b> <b>assembly</b> without the authorization of the monarch. They concluded a [...] "brotherly union" [...] against their enemies in early September, pledging to provide military assistance to each other against both internal and foreign aggressors. The bishop seems to have acknowledged that petty noblemen were exempt from paying the tithe, according to Demény, because the Diet of Hungary decreed that noblemen could not be forced to pay the tithe in 1438.|$|E
