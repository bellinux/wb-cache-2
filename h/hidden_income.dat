Milford as London publisher had fully supported the Music Department during its years of formation and growth. However, he came under increasing pressure from the Delegates in Oxford concerning the continued flow of expenditures from what seemed to them an unprofitable venture. In their mind, the operations at Amen House were supposed to be both academically respectable and financially remunerative. The London office [...] "existed to make money for the Clarendon Press to spend on the promotion of learning." [...] Further, OUP treated its book publications as short-term projects: any books that did not sell within a few years of publication were written off (to show as unplanned or <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> if in fact they sold thereafter). In contrast, the Music Department's emphasis on music for performance was comparatively long-term and continuing, particularly as income from recurring broadcasts or recordings came in, and as it continued to build its relationships with new and upcoming musicians. The Delegates were not comfortable with Foss's viewpoint: [...] "I still think this word 'loss' is a misnomer: is it not really capital invested?" [...] wrote Foss to Milford in 1934.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{communities}} {{engage in}} risk-sharing with asymmetric information, wherein {{a member of}} a risk-sharing group is unable to verify the income and shocks experienced by the others, they are unable to achieve full smoothing of income risk (Thomas and Worrall 1990). The frictions that drive the possible negative impacts of <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> are likely to be mediated by the relationships among a risk-sharing group’s members in the social network. Using a laboratory experiment in Karnataka, India, we study the interaction of informal insurance with <b>hidden</b> <b>income,</b> hidden savings, and social networks. <b>Hidden</b> <b>income</b> significantly reduces risk sharing: transfers between partner falls by ~ 40 % on average when income is hidden, though the effect of <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> is mitigated when player can chose their risk-sharing partners. Among self-selected dyads, there is a strong correlation between social proximity and better risk-sharing. However, social proximity does not improve risk sharing when partners of the same distance are randomly assigned. This suggests that aspects of social networks beyond geodesic proximity matter for risk sharing when information is hidden. Finally, for pairs with low social proximity, removal of commitment on top of <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> and savings appears to further crowd out interpersonal risk-sharing, while pairs who are closely connected via the networks appear less affected by removal of commitment...|$|E

However, and despite the recent increase in the technical sophistication of the two estimation methods most commonly employed in the empirical literature, namely the monetary approach and the multiple causes-indicators technique, it is necessary to continue making advances in our knowledge of the relationships between the hidden economy and its economic and institutional environment. Against this background, this paper sets out to provide empirical evidence on this question.

40|$|We develop general {{recursive}} {{methods to}} solve for optimal contracts in dynamic principal-agent models with both <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> and hidden actions.

Starting from a general mechanism with arbitrary communication, randomization, and full history dependence, we show that the optimal contract can be implemented with a number of direct recursive mechanisms, all established to be equivalent to one another. The state variable for the most natural recursive formulation is a vector of utility promises conditional on the realized endowment. However, this formulation suffers from a curse of dimensionality which arises from the interaction of <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> and hidden investment. The curse can be overcome either by reporting unobserved income twice, or by introducing judiciously chosen utility bounds for deviation behavior off the equilibrium path.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple model of intra-household {{bargaining}} relations in rural Ghana, a {{context in which}} men and women hold separate economies and spending patterns differ by gender. The model shows how when there is asymmetric information over monetary transfers between spouses, the incentives to <b>hide</b> <b>income</b> depend on the role spouses play within the household. Specifically, the obligation incumbent on men in Akan tradition to make transfers to their wives gives them a strategic advantage which may induce wives to <b>hide</b> <b>income</b> from their husbands. We then test the model‘s predictions using data from a unique field experiment in rural Ghana, where participants in a household survey had a chance to win public and private lottery prizes. These prizes were allocated at random to husbands or wives. The household survey data capture how these prizes were subsequently used. We find significant differences in the use of prize money depending on its visibility. Public prizes were spent in more visible ways, such as on food, household assets or health. There is evidence that husbands and wives both hid private prize money, but in different ways. Wives were more likely than husbands to save their private cash prizes. Both spouses also invested prize winnings in their social network in the form of gifts or loans. To the extent that there is a distortion in the allocation of private income, we find that it is intertemporal rather than product-specific, and biased towards greater saving.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> arising from home ownership has important consequences for poverty measurement as it tends to favour certain low income groups, especially the elderly, and to have a moderating effect on poverty rates in countries with high levels of home ownership. This article explores both methodological and substantive aspects of this issue using data for 14 EU countries drawn from the European Community Household Panel Survey 1996. Methodologically, in the absence of data needed to estimate <b>hidden</b> <b>income</b> from housing directly, it explores the validity of using a housing expenditures approach to take account of the income effects of housing in a poverty measurement context. Substantively, it examines whether poverty measured in this way in the 14 countries in the data set differs in expected directions from poverty as conventionally measured. The substantive effects are found to be modest overall and to conform only partially to expectations. Certain methodological problems raise a question mark over these findings, such as variation across countries in the degree to which mortgage payments capture the cost of house purchase for home owners. The article concludes that the distributive effects of housing are important for poverty measurement but need to be better understood within each country before attempting cross-country analysis.

At the same time, gross HSRs are negatively related to the female employment rate, the ratio of indirect taxes to direct taxes, and to the tax wedge.
