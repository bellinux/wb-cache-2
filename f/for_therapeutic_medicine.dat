40|$|Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hBMSCs) present {{promising}} opportunities <b>for</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine.</b> Carbon derivatives showed only marginal enhancement in stem cell differentiation toward bone formation. Here {{we report that}} red-light absorbing carbon nitride (C 3 N 4) sheets lead to remarkable proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2) activation, a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation. Accordingly, highly effective hBMSCs-driven mice bone regeneration under red light is achieved (91 % recovery after 4 weeks compared to 36 % recovery in the standard control group in phosphate-buffered saline without red light). This fast bone regeneration is attributed to the deep penetration strength of red light into cellular membranes via tissue and the resulting efficient cell stimulation by enhanced photocurrent upon two-photon excitation of C 3 N 4 sheets near cells. Given that the photoinduced charge transfer can increase cytosolic Ca 2 + accumulation, this increase would promote nucleotide synthesis and cellular proliferation/differentiation. The cell stimulation enhances hBMSC differentiation toward bone formation, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of near-infrared two-photon absorption of C 3 N 4 sheets in bone regeneration and fracture healing. ope...|$|E

Here we reported the bio-assay-guided identification and isolation of angiogenic tannins (angio-T) from Geum japonicum that induced rapid revascularization of infarcted myocardium and promoted survival potential of the viable cardiomyocytes at risk after myocardial infarction. Our results demonstrated that angio-T displayed potent dual effects on up-regulating expression of angiogenic factors, which would contribute to the early revascularization and protection of the cardiomyocytes against further ischemic injury, and inducing antiapoptotic protein expression, which inhibited apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes in the infarcted hearts and limited infarct size. Echocardiographic studies demonstrated that angio-T-induced therapeutic effects on acute infarcted myocardium were accompanied by significant functional improvement by 2 days after infarction. This improvement was sustained for 14 days.

40|$|As the {{occurrence}} of breast cancer increases around the world, the need <b>for</b> new <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine</b> becomes more vital to sustain the population. In order to accomplish this, specific mechanisms need to be understood to gain a perspective on the overall process of breast cancer development. One mechanism that is being researched is SUMOylation. The SUMOylation reaction uses small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which act {{as a type of}} post-translational modification that is necessary in order to preserve protein homeostasis and regulate cellular processes including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and response to stress. The SUMOs attach to a target protein through a SUMO E 3 ligase and the modified protein then gains different cellular functions. An example of the SUMO-mediated protein degradation involves Arkadia, a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, which stimulates the degradation of the Ski protein, which is associated with tumor growth and development. Breast Cancer Associated Gene 2 or BCA 2 is identified as an E 3 ligase in the ubiquitin proteasome system. It has been found that BCA 2 is co-expressed with the estrogen receptor (ER) in ER-positive breast cancer cells. ER is crucial in the regulation of cell cycle progression and growth of breast cancer epithelial cells. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} BCA 2 gene is regulated by the ER and BCA 2 protein interacts with UBC 9 and E 2 ligase in the SUMOylation pathway. The regulation of BCA 2 could prove critical since it could mediate the ubiquitination and possible SUMOylation of target proteins. While BCA 2 as an Ubiquitin E 3 ligase has been well established, its role in SUMOylation is unknown. The aim of this thesis is to identify BCA 2 ’s involvement in SUMOylation. To achieve this, I performed bioinformatics analysis of the BCA 2 protein sequence and found that out of the 6 lysines (Ks) in the sequence, K 32 is the possible lysine important for SUMO attachment. I also tested the SUMOylation of BCA 2 in an in vitro assay by using SUMO-specific proteins. The results have revealed an association between SUMO 2 / 3 and BCA 2. Plasmids containing SUMO 1 and 2 / 3 were then purified from Top 10 bacterial cultures and were transfected into HEK 293 cells for immunoprecipitation experiments. Preliminary data from these experiments reveal a possible interaction of BCA 2 with SUMO 2 / 3. The involvement of BCA 2 in both ubiquitination and SUMOylation pathways as an E 3 ligase makes it a novel target <b>for</b> <b>therapeutic</b> intervention <b>for</b> the prevention and treatment of breast cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{receptor}} {{study is}} critically relevant in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine</b> since the intricate details of disease states pertaining to atherosclerosis and diabetes are poorly understood. Three nuclear receptors of interest regulate target genes pertaining to cholesterol and fatty acid regulation, linking these receptors to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine.</b> The {{first is the}} peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa), which resides in liver and muscle, coordinating lipoprotein and fatty acid homeostasis [1]. Cholesterol homeostasis is dictated by the liver X receptor alpha (LXRa), targeting genes pertaining to the kidney, intestine, liver and adipose tissues [2]. A common partner receptor to PPARa and LXRa {{is known as the}} retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) [3]. Although each receptor appears unique in function, the cause and effects of disease states are poorly understood due to the promiscuous nature of these receptor proteins. These particular receptors can form permissive heterodimers where metabolic effects can be manipulated by ligands [3]. Accordingly, clinical care becomes increasingly complex as synthetic ligands made to target one receptor could have additional repercussions. With respect to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine,</b> ligand binding may not be exclusive. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study synthetic ligands with each receptor, individually and in heterodimeric form, to further understand the complex regulation and clinical implications of synthetic ligands on disease states such as atherosclerosis and diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{influence}} of a magnetic field on human is monitored by the evaluation of bio-impedance changes of a tissue, which is exposed by a strong magnetic field. The pulse magnetic field {{in the form of}} a binary pseudo-random process or a pulse field with constant frequency of some few tens Hz was used. A couple of Helmholz coils or a small magneto-therapeutic apparatus were used as the applicator. The maximum value of the magnetic flux density reached 60 mT. A forearm of a person under test was exposed to a magnetic field and there was measured the bio-impedance. Bio-impedance was evaluated by a narrowband RF vector impedance meter by use of four-point method. A rising level of the bio-impedance signal at about 60 % was indicated during the 15 minutes exposure by a magnetic field. There was not found a significant difference between the stochastic and the deterministic field effect. I.

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen a very {{dramatic}} rise {{in the production of}} megavoltage X-ray and electron accelerators <b>for</b> use in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicine.</b> Concomitant with this increase has been the need to develop accurate and reliable methods for measuring the deposition of radiation energy within the irradiated medium. Frequently, the ionometric methods used for assessing the absorbed dose in materials irradiated by X-ray beams generated at a few hundreds of kV have been extended to the megavoltage region, but, whilst the precision and reliability of such methods have generally been unaffected by this extension, the interpretation of such measurements and their relationship to the absorbed dose has become extremely complex. In this situation the technique of calorimetry offers the only direct and unambiguous approach for measuring the absorbed dose and this thesis deals with the design, construction and operation of such an instrument with the particular intention of calibrating a number of secondary dosimeters. The production of a stable temperature environment, which enables the small temperature changes encountered in calorimetry to be measured accurately, is discussed and it was concluded that a multi-jacket system, operated in the quasi-adiabatic mode, was the most suitable. The actual temperature measurements were made with a Wheatstone Bridge Network, using a thermistor transducer, and it is shown that if a particular criterion is adopted for the sensitivity of the system then the bridge can be so designed to maximise this sensitivity. The practical construction of a bridge system using a phase sensitive detector and capable of a temperature resolution of 2 x 10 5 K is also described...|$|R

Hattingh 1, M King 1, S Maganlal 1, A Gulley 1, J Kilby 1, V Pavkovic 1 1 Griffith University School of Pharmacy Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Reform, amongst a range of changes, introduced incentive payments to community pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. There have been reports that generic substitution rates have significantly increased since these changes with patient safety being compromised in some instances. A need was therefore identified to determine the processes and procedures in place in community pharmacies regarding generic dispensing. Ten Gold Coast community pharmacists were chosen through stratified random selection to participate in structured interviews. The interviews were conducted during January 2009 to explore opinions, perceptions, experiences {{and knowledge of the}} PBS changes regarding generic substitution and the potential impact of these changes on pharmacy practice and patient safety. Interviews ranged between 13 and 32 minutes, were voice recorded and subsequently transcribed. Thematic content analysis of the interviews, inductive analysis and continual comparison of categories and concepts enabled common and distinct themes to be clarified. The study found all participants had a basic knowledge of bioequivalence and could explain what generic substitution involved to their patients. The majority of the participants indicated that the $ 1. 50 PBS premium free dispensing incentive had encouraged greater use of generic medicines. However, overall they were well aware of instances when substitution may be inappropriate: <b>for</b> example narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>medicines</b> or that it would cause patient confusion.
