5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna resurrected {{the question of}} which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern–Levison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that this {{is expected to be}} the case, and several astronomers have called it one.|$|E

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E

5|$|The autumn was {{dominated}} by the Basso's involvement in Operación Puerto. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent, and the case against Basso was eventually dropped by the Federazione Ciclistica Italiana for lack of evidence, but without him authorizing a DNA test that could <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> him conclusively. Basso adamantly denied being involved. (On 7 May 2007 Basso admitted involvement in Operación Puerto). Team CSC have since started an ambitious anti-doping program together with the Danish anti-doping expert Rasmus Damsgaard. Meanwhile, on the road, Voigt dominated the Deutschland Tour, winning overall and three stages, including a mountain finish and a time trial. Sastre came fourth in the Vuelta after starting in the lead when CSC won the initial team time trial. It was Sastre's fifth Grand Tour in a row.|$|E
5|$|Queen of the South {{started the}} game as the livelier team, pushing forward early on; however, Brechin City had the first goal scoring {{opportunity}} of the final when Graham Gibson's long range shot was saved by Queen of the South goalkeeper Andy Goram. Peter Weatherson had a similar opportunity for Queen of the South after a pass from Derek Lyle but was also saved by Brechin's goalkeeper, David Hay. Hay made another save 10 minutes later after another Weatherson attempt from Steve Bowey's pass. After 28 minutes, Brechin player Chris Jackson was booked for a foul on Bowey and Queen of the South scored the first goal of the game shortly after in the 33rd minute but with controversy; John O'Neill rebounded {{the ball into the}} goal after Bowey's initial shot was saved by the goalkeeper but Brechin defender Greg McCulloch claimed to <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> the ball off the line, however, referee John Underhill awarded the goal. Weatherson almost scored again shortly before half time when he headed the ball into goalkeeper Hay's hands after a Robbie Neilson cross.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E

25|$|The seven-member {{committee}} {{drafted a}} definition which preserved Pluto’s status by only requiring a planet to be (1) {{large enough to}} assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape) and (2) orbiting a star without itself being a star. This proposal was criticized by many for weakening {{the meaning of the}} term. The eventual definition adopted by the IAU added an additional requirement, that a body must <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> its neighborhood of all other sizable objects, language that Gingerich was “not at all pleased” with.|$|E
25|$|Cricket {{grounds in}} most parts of the world are devoid of any trees or shrubs. The lime tree at the St Lawrence Ground was an exception: the ground opened as the Beverley Ground in 1847, and was built around the tree. The {{presence}} of a tree within the playing area required special local rules. Shots blocked by the tree were counted as a four. Only four cricketers <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> the tree to score a six: Arthur 'Jacko' Watson of Sussex in 1925, the West Indies' Learie Constantine (1928), Middlesex's Jim Smith (1939), and Carl Hooper (1992).|$|E
25|$|In {{many places}} around the world, {{riparian}} zones have been completely eliminated as humans <b>have</b> <b>cleared</b> land for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes. Removing riparian vegetation increases the erodibility of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration. In addition, removal of riparian vegetation fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches. This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat. Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity.|$|E
