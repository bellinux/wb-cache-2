It was cut late during production because the voice actor for Hendrix did not sound enough like Hendrix. Franklin's line was kept because [...] "nobody knows what <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> like", whereas Hendrix had a distinct voice.|$|E
500|$|Bobby Edner's {{portrayal}} of Vaan has been met with mostly positive reception. Cavin Smith praised his acting, stating that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> like an actual teenager without sounding whiny. Agustin praised the developers for giving Vaan a voice actor, commenting that it prevents any awkward silences from a silent protagonist. He added however that Vaan is [...] "decidedly quiet", owing {{to many of}} the conversations not requiring his input, which Agustin called a [...] "brilliant interactive storytelling device". His design change from Final Fantasy XII to Revenant Wings was criticized by RPGFan editor Patrick Gann, for going from a teenage design to {{what appears to be the}} design of a 10-year-old Vaan.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E
500|$|To promote Beyond the Sea, Spacey and Phil Ramone {{devised a}} 12-city United States concert tour titled An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin, which {{consisted}} of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band. [...] "It's me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking {{a little bit about}} the movie," [...] Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> good."

500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We were just trying to capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has this crazy dynamic range – a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and we would see how big it can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the sound of his voice in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E

500|$|Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{negative}} towards the album, writing that [...] "Let the Blind Lead presents an intriguing mixture of sounds, but rarely does Cox whip them into anything very exciting." [...] In his review, he likened the album to a [...] "tempered" [...] version of Deerhunter's Cryptograms. [...] Under the Radar magazine wrote {{that many of}} the tracks of Let the Blind Lead [...] "never materialize into anything more substantial than vapor." [...] Sean O'Neal of The Onion's The A.V. Club said that, considering the number of free songs Cox has released on his blog, a full-length album [...] "seems almost beside the point." [...] He wrote that the record's songs suggest the work of [...] "a bedroom-pop auteur who doesn't know when to quit tweaking". [...] Allmusic writer Marisa Brown found that, with Let the Blind Lead, [...] "as with Deerhunter, Cox has the tendency to try too hard to be profound (take the title -- or the title track -- for example), wanting so badly to say something important that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> trite and forced, and untrustworthy." [...] Jonathen Cohen wrote in his review for Magnet that [...] "Cox’s narratives make little sense", noting [...] "much of the time, he’s not even singing so much as wailing wordlessly".|$|E
500|$|By 1994, Ice {{received}} less publicity and became {{removed from the}} public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album [...] "more clunky than funky".|accessdate=March 7, 2009|last=Bernard|first=James|date=March 25, 1994|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}} Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song [...] "Get Loose" [...] as [...] "snappy", writing that although the lyrics are [...] "inane", [...] "the song is a thumping party, {{one of the few}} places where Ice loosens up. <b>He</b> <b>sounds</b> solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics." [...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing." [...] Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: [...] "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people." [...] When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said [...] "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.|$|E
500|$|However, Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music {{felt that}} the album lacked inspiration, and wrote, [...] "nothing sticks, there's no guts, no depth {{and no matter how}} much he protests to the contrary, nothing to believe". Rolling Stone Melissa Maerz {{perceived}} that Usher had put little effort into the record and stated that [...] "now that he's got the American Dream, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> like he's stopped trying." [...] Blender Josh Eells was let down by the large number of ballads and lack of sexual content. Clover Hope of The Village Voice described it as [...] "pure grown-man bidness" [...] and [...] "a little too sitting-on-the-dock-of-the-bay for Chris Breezy–trained earbuds". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine scored Here I Stand two-and-a-half stars out of five, and considered the music [...] "almost always just one notch above mediocrity." [...] The Observer Steve Yates panned the album as [...] "gloop [...] wades through". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau cited the songs [...] "Trading Places" [...] and [...] "Best Thing" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating [...] "good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "tension, not bliss, creates the album's best songs", referring to [...] "Moving Mountains", [...] "His Mistakes", [...] "Appetite" [...] and [...] "What's a Man To Do".

500|$|Upon its release, Romances was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Terry Jenkins of AllMusic praised the collaborative work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called Romances [...] "a sensuous, enchanting album". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune called Miguel's voice the album's strong point and noted the [...] "presence of electronic instruments and the darker, more somber mood". On the other hand, she felt that Miguel was beginning [...] "to slip", citing the tracks [...] "Jurame" [...] and [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] as examples. Fernando Gonzalez wrote for the Orange County Register noting although the album is [...] "Impeccably produced, arranged and recorded", he felt that boleros [...] "demand more than that". Gonzalez elaborated: [...] " [...] <b>He</b> <b>sounds</b> simply loud, rather than romantic, in [...] "Sabor a Mi; he comes across as (soap) operatic rather than tormented in [...] "El Reloj [...] "; he is a star -- not a humble student -- in [...] "Contigo Aprendi"." [...] The Corpus Christi Caller-Times music critic Rene Carbrera wrote a positive review of the album praising the string arrangements as [...] "elegantly done" [...] and complimented Miguel's take on [...] "Sabor a Mí" [...] and [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] {{as he had done}} it [...] "delightfully done in the traditional way and flavored with Trio Los Panchos requinto [...] "cling" [...] endings." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote an unfavorable review of the recording; he criticized its productions for having all the tracks [...] "awash in silky keyboards and airy strings with just a hint of percussion in the background". He also panned its lead single [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] for coming off as a [...] "love song for the chaste" [...] due to its arrangements being [...] "so stifling, so precious, it's difficult to feel any sensuality".|$|E

2500|$|Different {{actors have}} used {{different}} regional accents in the role. The first six Doctors spoke in Received Pronunciation or [...] "BBC English", as was standard on British television at the time. Sylvester McCoy used a very mild {{version of his}} own Scottish accent in the role, and Paul McGann spoke with a faint Liverpudlian lilt. Only rarely is this even addressed in the programme. In {{the case of the}} McGann's Doctor, who is identified by American characters as [...] "British", he seems only slightly conscious of the way <b>he</b> <b>sounds,</b> responding with [...] "Yes, I suppose I am." [...] When the accent of Eccleston's Doctor is clearly described as [...] "Northern", he responds with the line [...] "Lots of planets have a North."

2500|$|Dave Heaton of PopMatters {{rated the}} album 8/10, stating [...] "Critics often {{use the word}} “cinematic” to {{describe}} the Wu-Tang sound. That word {{has never been more}} appropriate than with 8 Diagrams. RZA taps into his Ghost Dog and Kill Bill experiences to create imaginary film music, moody would-be scores to Westerns, martial arts, sci-fi and gangster films." [...] Blenders Jonah Weiner from commended RZA's production, stating [...] "RZA has always been hip-hop’s reigning minimalist, but his work scoring Kill Bill, most recently, seems to have strengthened his ear for ambiance and texture." [...] Weiner also complimented Method Man's delivery and rhymes on the album, stating that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> [...] "rejuvenated." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nate Patrin complimented the group members' lyricism. Sam Richards of Uncut gave 8 Diagrams 4 out of 5 stars, and stated [...] "RZA’s lurching beats and raw, spectral productions, peppered with kung-fu film samples, are back to their thrillingly weird best. RZA’s dictatorial rule has ostracised Ghost and Raekwon, but you can’t argue with the results. On record at least, Wu-Tang have made the comeback of the decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003) {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, after Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart both {{turned down the}} role. The make-up and costumes were based on designs by John Howe and Alan Lee. According to Jackson, McKellen based his performance as Gandalf on Tolkien himself:We listened to audio recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from Lord of the Rings. We watched some BBC interviews with him — there's a few interviews with Tolkien — and Ian based his performance on an impersonation of Tolkien. He's literally basing Gandalf on Tolkien. <b>He</b> <b>sounds</b> the same, he uses the speech patterns and his mannerisms are born {{out of the same}} roughness from the footage of Tolkien. So, Tolkien would recognize himself in Ian's performance. For the first film, McKellen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He later reprised the role in The Hobbit film series (2012–2014), claiming that he enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than Gandalf the White.

[...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you.

It's not Thriller or Bad or even Off the Wall and it's not trying to be." [...] Jae-Ha Kim of Chicago Sun-Times, noted [...] "'Is It Scary' shows a darker side of Jackson than even the tabloids would have you believe...With the hypnotic 'Morphine', <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> like a seductive cousin of Trent Reznor's." [...] Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution gave the album a D grade. She claimed that, [...] "'Ghosts' pounds with funk until Jackson's weak vocals come in." [...] She described [...] "Morphine" [...] as an [...] "overblown rock hiss". The Virginian-Pilot gave the album a positive review, also expressing the opinion that [...] "Morphine" [...] sounded [...] "eerily like 'State of Shock'", and continued, [...] "'Scream Louder' a remix of his hit duet with sister Janet, {{is better than the}} original only because it takes away the overpowering guitar twangs." [...] The Washington Post described [...] "Superfly Sister" [...] as [...] "sex funk", adding, [...] "'Morphine' apparently told from the drug's point of view and featuring both the Andrae Crouch Singers and an orchestra, alternates between hard-edged rock and operatic pop." ...|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, producer Harvey Mason, Jr., half of production duo The Underdogs, who co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Turn Up the Music", spoke more about the album, saying [...] "The Fortune record is F.A.M.E to the next level. Similar material, but he's really being innovative {{with some of the}} music that you haven't heard before, taking pieces of other genres and integrating them into pop and R, which I think is really cool.
