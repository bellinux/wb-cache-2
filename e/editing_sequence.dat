40|$|The edit {{distance}} between strings a 1 … am and b 1 … bn is the minimum cost s of {{a sequence of}} editing steps (insertions, deletions, changes) that convert one string into the other. A well-known tabulating method computes s {{as well as the}} corresponding <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> in time and in space O(mn) (in space O(min(m, n)) if the <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> is not required). Starting from this method, we develop an improved algorithm that works in time and in space O(s · min(m, n)). Another improvement with time O(s · min(m, n)) and space O(s · min(s, m, n)) is given for the special case where all editing steps have the same cost independently of the characters involved. If the <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> that gives cost s is not required, our algorithms can be implemented in space O(min(s, m, n)). Since s = O(max(m, n)), the new methods are always asymptotically as good as the original tabulating method. As a by-product, algorithms are obtained that, given a threshold value t, test in time O(t · min(m, n)) and in space O(min(t, m, n)) whether s ⩽ t. Finally, different generalized edit distances are analyzed and conditions are given under which our algorithms can be used in conjunction with extended edit operation sets, including, for example, transposition of adjacent characters...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{which is}} contained in this thesis is {{in the area of}} the development of 1 H spectral editing techniques for use in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo 1 H NMR spectrum potentially contains a wealth of biological data. Information on the metabolic and physiological status of the "sample" can potentially be obtained non-invasively. However, due to the inhomogeneous environment encountered in vivo, most 1 H NMR signals are indistinguishable, with only a few metabolites being observed. A number of techniques have previously been developed to try to edit the in vivo 1 H spectrum, but with limited success.;In this thesis new 1 H editing sequences are developed by using a number of simple spectral editing techniques. Several spectral editing sequences have been developed around individual metabolites such as ethanolamine and taurine. In these cases the initial design of the <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> was the double-quantum filter. In each sequence, the selectivity of the experiment was increased by the introduction of chemical shift selective pulses.;Two more general editing sequences which can edit for a number of metabolites have also been developed. The first sequence is called SELECTER and can be used to edit for the metabolites aspartate, myo-inositol and GABA. This <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> is based around the principle of magnetisation transfer. In the case of aspartate and myo-inositol, SELECTER gives greater edited signal intensity, than for other spectral editing techniques.;The other more general spectral <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> edits for singlet resonances, namely N-acetyl-aspartate, choline and creatine in the in vivo 1 H NMR spectrum. Although these metabolites are clearly visible, underlying metabolite resonances distort their measurement. Previous attempts to remove these unwanted resonances introduced errors such as transverse relaxation attenuation. The sequence developed removes underlying metabolite resonances from around singlets in a shorter time where transverse relaxation losses are much lower, thus minimising any errors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Marine Genomics {{project is}} a {{functional}} genomics initiative developed to provide a pipeline for the curation of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and gene expression microarray data for marine organisms. It provides a unique clearing-house for marine specific EST and microarray data and is currently available at [URL]. Description The Marine Genomics pipeline automates the processing, maintenance, storage and analysis of EST and microarray data for {{an increasing number of}} marine species. It currently contains 19 species databases (over 46, 000 EST sequences) that are maintained by registered users from local and remote locations in Europe and South America in addition to the USA. A collection of analysis tools are implemented. These include a pipeline upload tool for EST FASTA file, sequence trace file and microarray data, an annotative text search, automated sequence trimming, sequence quality control (QA/QC) <b>editing,</b> <b>sequence</b> BLAST capabilities and a tool for interactive submission to GenBank. Another feature of this resource is the integration with a scientific computing analysis environment implemented by MATLAB. Conclusion The conglomeration of multiple marine organisms with integrated analysis tools enables users to focus on the comprehensive descriptions of transcriptomic responses to typical marine stresses. This cross species data comparison and integration enables users to contain their research within a marine-oriented data management and analysis environment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Regions of the Didymium iridis {{mitochondrial}} genome {{were identified}} with similarity to typical mitochondrial genes; however, these regions contained numerous stop codons. We used RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether, through RNA editing, these regions were transcribed into mRNAs that could encode functional proteins. Ten putative gene regions were examined: atp 1, atp 6, atp 8, atp 9, cox 1, cox 2, cytb, nad 4 L, nad 6, and nad 7. The cDNA sequences of each gene could encode a functional mitochondrial protein that was highly conserved compared with homologous genes. The type of editing events and <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> features {{were very similar}} to those observed in the homologous genes of Physarum polycephalum, though the actual editing locations showed a variable degree of conservation. Edited sites were compared with encoded sites in D. iridis and P. polycephalum for all 10 genes. Edited sequence for a portion of the cox 1 gene was available for six myxomycetes, which, when compared, showed a high degree of conservation at the protein level. Different types of editing events showed varying degrees of site conservation with C-to-U base changes being the least conserved. Several aspects of single C insertion editing events led to the preferential creation of hydrophobic amino acid codons that may help to minimize adverse effects on the resulting protein structure...|$|E
40|$|N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) is {{responsible}} {{for the majority of the}} most prominent peak in (1) H-MR spectra, and has been used as diagnostic marker for several pathologies. However, ~ 10 % of this peak can be attributed to N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), a neuropeptide whose release may be triggered by intense neuronal activation. Separate measurement of NAA and NAAG using MRS is difficult due to large superposition of their spectra. Specifically, in functional MRS (fMRS) experiments, most work has evaluated the sum NAA+NAAG, which does not appear to change during experiments. The aim of this work was to design and perform an fMRS experiment using visual stimulation and a spectral <b>editing</b> <b>sequence,</b> MEGA-PRESS, to further evaluate the individual dynamics of NAA and NAAG during brain activation. The functional paradigm used consisted of three blocks, starting with a rest (baseline) block of 320 s, followed by a stimulus block (640 s) and a rest block (640 s). Twenty healthy subjects participated in this study. On average, subjects followed a pattern of NAA decrease and NAAG increase during stimulation, with a tendency to return to basal levels at the end of the paradigm, with a peak NAA decrease of -(21 ± 19) % and a peak NAAG increase of (64 ± 62) % (Wilcoxon test, p < 0. 05). These results may relate to: 1) the only known NAAG synthesis pathway is from NAA and glutamate; 2) a relationship between NAAG and the BOLD response...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A common {{model for}} {{computing}} {{the similarity of}} two strings X and Y of lengths m and n respectively, with m n, is to transform X into Y through a <b>sequence</b> of <b>edit</b> operations, called an <b>edit</b> <b>sequence.</b> The <b>edit</b> operations are of three types: insertion, deletion, and substitution. A given cost function assigns a weight to each edit operation. The amortized weight for a given <b>edit</b> <b>sequence</b> is the ratio of its weight to its length, and the minimum of this ratio over all <b>edit</b> <b>sequences</b> is the normalized edit distance. Existing algorithms for normalized edit distance computation with proven complexity bounds require O(mn 2) time in the worst-case. We give provably better algorithms: an O(mn log n) -time algorithm when the cost function is uniform, i. e, the weights of edit operations depend only on the type {{but not on the}} individual symbols involved, and an O(mn log m) -time algorithm when the weights are rational...|$|R
40|$|Editing of {{paramyxovirus}} P gene mRNAs occurs cotranscriptionally {{and functions}} to fuse an alternate downstream {{open reading frame}} to the N-terminal half of the P protein. G residues are inserted into a short G run contained within a larger purine run (AnGn) in this process, by a mechanism whereby the transcribing polymerase stutters (i. e., reads the same template cytosine more than once). Although Sendai virus (SeV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bPIV 3) are closely related, the G insertions in their P mRNAs are distributed differently. SeV predominantly inserts a single G residue within the G run of the sequence 5 ' AACAAAAAAGGG, whereas bPIV 3 inserts one to six G's at roughly equal frequency within the sequence 5 ' AUUAAAAAAGGGG (differences are underlined). We have examined how the cis-acting <b>editing</b> <b>sequence</b> determines the number of G's inserted, both in a transfected cell system using minigenome analogues and by generating recombinant viruses. We found {{that the presence of}} four rather than three G's in the purine run did not affect the distribution of G insertions. However, when the underlined AC of the SeV sequence was replaced by the UU found in bPIV 3, the editing phenotype from both the minigenome and the recombinant virus resembled that found in natural bPIV 3 infections (i. e., a significant fraction of the mRNAs contained two to six G insertions). The two nucleotides located just upstream of the polypurine tract are thus key determinants of the editing phenotype of these viruses. Moreover, the minimum number of A residues that will promote SeV editing phenotype is six but can be reduced to five when the upstream AC is replaced by UU. A model for how the upstream dinucleotide controls the insertion phenotype is presented...|$|E
