5|$|Athletes, {{including}} Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel {{have been}} suspended or fined for making the gesture. José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire; he hasn't played in the majors since. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is also famous for flashing one or both middle fingers {{as part of his}} gimmick.|$|E

25|$|The {{two teams}} {{had made a}} trade in December 1980 that was {{expected}} to benefit both teams. Milwaukee traded pitchers Dave LaPoint and Lary Sorenson and outfielders Sixto Lezcano and David Green to the Cardinals, with Pete Vuckovich and Ted Simmons comprising two thirds of St. Louis' return. The Cardinals had already traded for Fingers, who had played for the San Diego Padres, but after acquiring him the team acquired Sutter from the Chicago Cubs and thus added <b>Fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trade with the Brewers.|$|E
25|$|Experts agree hand-washing {{can help}} prevent viral infections, {{including}} ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu. Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eyes, nose or mouth. Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.|$|E
25|$|Using this convention, {{polarization}} {{is defined}} {{from the point}} of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb away from the source, in the same direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while looking away from the source and in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E

25|$|The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl {{comes into}} the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has {{returned}} to her home after her first ball. She holds a rose as a souvenir of the evening. She drops into a chair and falls asleep. The rose falls from her <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball {{in such a way}} that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name full roller. In {{addition}} to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be very straight such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the fingers in the 3 o'clock position (for a right hander) at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball.|$|E
500|$|The New Progressive Party (PNP) {{published}} {{advertisements in}} favor of the amendments using the pictures of two young men recently accused of murder. The pictures, taken after their arrests, show both men with their middle <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera. The advertisement reads [...] "If you don't vote, they win". The mother of one {{of the men in the}} picture, Vilmarie Carrasquillo, presented a preliminary injunction to withdraw the advertisement, arguing that his son's right for privacy was violated. However, the San Juan Court determined that the PNP could continue using the advertisement. Two days before the referendum, the Supreme Court ratified the decision of the Court of San Juan allowing the PNP to continue with their campaign.|$|E

Bush <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> protest <b>the</b> War in Iraq. Serbian protesters gave <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević. Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement. As a political message <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Czech President, Czech artist David Cerny floated an outsize, purple statue of a hand on the River Vltava in Prague; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle, the Presidential seat.|$|R

Hunt criticised 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell for failing to defend his F1 title in 1993, stating that Mansell left to [...] "avoid racing Alain Prost in the same car" [...] and gave [...] "two <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> business and the team". Hunt also described IndyCar as [...] "club racing, the standards are not high there compared to Grand Prix racing", stating that Mansell could [...] "win the championship easily {{and then come back}} to real racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper {{made his}} directorial film debut with Easy Rider (1969), {{which he and}} co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern. The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award for [...] "Best First Work" [...] and a {{nomination}} for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (shared with Fonda and Southern). Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: [...] "With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion". Film critic Matthew Hays notes that, [...] "no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper".|$|E

"With Kennedy only eleven votes {{short of}} the nomination, Ted Kennedy {{approached}} the Wyoming delegation, where Kennedy was known to have {{eight and a half}} solid votes, Johnson had six, and one-half vote remained loyal to Adlai Stevenson. Suddenly one of Wyoming's leaders broke away from a frantic huddle with Ted Kennedy, hopped on a chair, and held up four <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> delegates. [...] "Give me four votes!" [...] he begged. [...] "We can put him over the top! Please give me four votes!" [...] Hastily the Wyoming delegates decided to write themselves a footnote to history. Chairman Roncalio proudly spoke of the honor that was his as Wyoming cast all fifteen of its votes for John F. Kennedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hussain's highest {{score of}} 115 {{occurred}} against India {{in the summer}} of 2002, during a game that was described by BBC correspondent Jonathan Agnew as [...] "the most exciting one-day international I have ever seen." [...] For some time before the game, Hussain's insistence of batting at number three and even his inclusion in the team had been repeatedly questioned by several members of the press, most notably Sky Sports commentators (and Hussain's future colleagues) Ian Botham and Bob Willis. His innings included a partnership of 185 with Marcus Trescothick (who scored 109 himself). After reaching his century Hussain courted controversy by gesturing wildly, pointing to the number 3 on his back and raising three <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media box. India were set a target of 326 to win and completed the chase with 3 balls to spare.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} allegations in the past regarding the circumstances {{which led to the}} Cinema Rex fire, however it is certain that it was a key event that triggered the Iranian revolution in 1978. Initially, the revolutionaries alleged that intelligence SAVAK agents were in pursuit of individuals who ran into the movie theatre and used it as an opportunity to hide in a large crowd at the cinema. [...] Later, either the fugitives, or the SAVAK agents chasing them decided to lock the doors of the cinema. Unable to escape from the building, everyone inside the cinema {{died as a result of}} the conflagration. The Iranian newspaper Sobhe Emruz pointed <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radical Islamists in an editorial, [...] "Don't make us disclose who were really behind the Cinema Rex fire" [...] they said. This caused the newspaper to be shut down shortly after.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 128 is {{comparable}} to the sonnet in Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo pleads for a first kiss. Like that pilgrim/saint tête-à-tête, this sonnet is set in a public musical celebration. Shakespeare watches his dark lady play the keyboard virginal (or Bassano built clavichord), captivated by her back swaying with the melody. Like Romeo, he longs for a kiss, but in this sonnet he envies the jacks (wooden keys) that the lady's playing fingers [...] "tickle" [...] while trilling the notes. Perhaps he also envies the other men (Jacks) standing around the lady. Surely, this is an amusing scene to Shakespeare because he secretly is having an affair with the dark lady. He decides not to envy those keys—although he would like to be tickled as they are—but hopes instead to receive a kiss on his lips. Fred Blick points out that this plea for a [...] "kiss", leaving the <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jacks, is a compromise, just as the tuning of the virginal or other keyboard instrument is, in musical temperament, a compromise.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that high prenatal testosterone and the ratio of <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>finger</b> are correlated.

A different digit ratio, the ratio of the index finger and <b>the</b> ring <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pinky is also collected and correlated with both of the other tests. Sometime during the study, a pattern of length change across the two hands was also observed and this was also correlated.
