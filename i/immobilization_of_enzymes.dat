50|$|In the past, {{biological}} washing powders and detergents contained many proteases and lipases {{that broke}} down dirt. However, when the cleaning products contacted human skin, they created allergic reactions. This is why <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> are important, not just economically.|$|E
5000|$|Despite their {{excellent}} catalytic capabilities, enzymes {{and their}} properties must be improved prior to industrial implementation in many cases. Some aspects of enzymes {{that must be}} improved prior to implementation are stability, activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural substrates. This may be accomplished through <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> on a solid material, such as a porous support. [...] <b>Immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> greatly simplifies the recovery process, enhances process control, and reduces operational costs. Many immobilization techniques exist, such as adsorption, covalent binding, affinity, and entrapment. Ideal immobilization processes should not use highly toxic reagents in the immobilization technique to ensure stability of the enzymes. After immobilization is complete, the enzymes are introduced into a reaction vessel for biocatalysis.|$|E

Controlled pore glass (CPG) with pore sizes between 50 and 300 nm is also excellently suited for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. In this application, a linker, a nucleoside or a non-nucleosidic compound, is first attached {{to the surface of}} CPG. The chain length of produced oligonucleotides is dependent on the pore size of CPG.|$|E
50|$|Dendronized {{polymers}} {{can contain}} several thousands of dendrons in one macromolecule {{and have a}} stretched out, anisotropic structure. In this regard they differ from the more or less spherically shaped dendrimers, where a few dendrons are attached to a small, dot-like core resulting in an isotropic structure. Depending on dendron generation, the polymers differ in thickness as the atomic force microscopy image shows (Figure 2). Neutral and charged dendronized polymers are highly soluble in organic solvents and in water, respectively. This is due to their low tendency to entangle. Dendronized polymers have been synthesized with, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyacetylene, polyphenylene, polythiophene, polyfluorene, poly(phenylene vinylene), poly(phenylene acetylene), polysiloxane, polyoxanorbornene, poly(ethylene imine)(PEI) backbones. Molar masses up to 200 Mio g/mol have been obtained. Dendronized polymers have been investigated for/as bulk structure control, responsivity to external stimuli, single molecule chemistry, templates for nanoparticle formation, catalysis, electro-optical devices, and bio-related applications. Particularly attractive {{is the use of}} water-soluble dendronized polymers for the <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> on solid surfaces (inside glass tubes or microfluidic devices) and for the preparation of dendronized polymer-enzyme conjugates.|$|E

Bearing in mind this necessity, the coupling of immobilization to the improvement of other enzyme features has been pursued by many researchers, and nowadays immobilization is recognized {{as a tool to}} improve not only stability, but also enzyme selectivity, specificity, resistance to inhibition or chemical modifiers, etc. To achieve these overall improvements of enzymes’ properties via immobilization, it is necessary to both develop new immobilization systems suitable for these purposes, and to achieve a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of interaction between enzymes and activated solids. That way, <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes,</b> far being an old-fashioned methodology to just reuse these expensive biocatalysts, is a tool of continuous interest that requires a continuous effort to be exploited in all its potential.

This adsorption type offers several advantages such as simplest operational procedure, specificity of the substrate and maintainability <b>of</b> the <b>enzymes</b> activity, low cost operation, and ease of solid support regeneration. However, <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzyme</b> by physical adsorption is also known to have a main limitation which is the enzyme immobilized onto the support surfaces will leach out for several cases (Balcao et al. 1996). Therefore, an optimization of functional groups was greatly needed in the system to produce a high performance of membrane reactor.|$|R
30|$|HRP {{molecules}} were {{immobilized on}} the modified ZnO nanocrystal surfaces using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. It was illustrated that the enzyme loading on the ZnO nanostructure {{was in the}} order of nanospheres < nanomultipod < nanodisks, while the nanomultipod reached the highest loading when its glutaraldehyde to amino groups ratio was lower than the other two, causing less conformation change of HRP on the ZnO surface, leading to a higher catalytic efficiency. In brief, the 3 D nanomultipod is more appropriate for the <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzyme</b> and for being used in catalytic reaction than the other two, which has great implications for the many ongoing studies <b>of</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>immobilization</b> and applications <b>of</b> the immobilized <b>enzymes.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of enzymatic biosensors {{based on the}} tyrosinase enzyme has attracted great interest {{for the detection of}} phenolic compounds (from, e. g., pesticides, pollutants) in ground or wastewaters [1, 2]. Our goal is to develop a biosensor based on conjugates of tyrosinase on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), taking advantage of the high surface areas of AuNPs, its unique electrochemical properties and ideal protein conjugation chemistry afforded by suitable functionalization. Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM) of thiolates form nanostructured surfaces with a diversity of functionalities and chemical characteristics that can favor the <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> in gold surfaces [3]. The <b>immobilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzymes</b> and bioactive conjugates in this type of nanostructured gold surfaces is a highly suited strategy for the {{development of}} biosensors with high activity and specificity. In the present work, the immobilization of tyrosinase-AuNP conjugates on SAMs of alkanethiols on nanostructured gold surfaces was studied by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AuNPs were functionalized with mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and conjugated with tyrosinase. Tyrosinase (1. 14. 18. 1) is...|$|E
