2500|$|In 1934 {{the chief}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the {{aircraft}} carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E

6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them? Would they be here, and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> them, if they were put away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins can be put away out of God's sight, if they are not even put out of your own sight?
