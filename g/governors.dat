5|$|There {{have been}} 55 {{official}} <b>governors</b> of New Jersey, with several others acting as governor for a time. In the official numbering, <b>governors</b> are counted only once each, and traditionally, only elected <b>governors</b> were included. However, legislation signed on January 10, 2006, allowed acting <b>governors</b> {{who had served}} at least 180 days to be considered full <b>governors.</b> The law was retroactive to January 1, 2001; it therefore changed the titles of Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, affecting Jim McGreevey's numbering. The current governor is Chris Christie, who took office on January 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Except for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's <b>governors</b> {{have been}} married {{at the time of}} their election. Whitcomb married while in office. About half of the <b>governors</b> {{have been married}} {{multiple}} times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings and Thomas R. Marshall, all of the state <b>governors</b> have also had children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy. Only twenty of Indiana's <b>governors</b> were native to the state. Seven were born in Pennsylvania, four born in Ohio, and four born in Kentucky.

5000|$|In New Jersey, a {{state which}} now has an office of {{lieutenant}} <b>governor,</b> {{in the event of}} a vacancy in the office of <b>governor,</b> the Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> becomes <b>governor.</b> In case of the inability of the current <b>governor</b> to fulfill the gubernatorial duties through injury, the Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> serves as the acting <b>governor.</b> The acting <b>governor</b> performs powers and duties until the <b>governor</b> recovers from the injuries. If the <b>governor's</b> death/resignation occurs less than 16 months before end of the term, the new <b>governor</b> serves until the end of the term, otherwise a special election (which the new <b>governor</b> may participate in) is held.|$|R

5|$|Michigan was {{originally}} part of French and British holdings, and administered by their colonial <b>governors.</b> After {{becoming part of}} the United States, numerous areas of what is today Michigan were originally part of the Northwest Territory, Indiana Territory and Illinois Territory, and administered by territorial <b>governors.</b> In 1805, the Michigan Territory was created, and five men served as territorial <b>governors,</b> until Michigan was granted statehood in 1837. Forty-eight individuals have held the position of state governor. The first female governor, Jennifer Granholm, was elected in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial <b>governors,</b> and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign.

50|$|When a <b>governor</b> and {{lieutenant}} <b>governor</b> are of {{the same}} party, the <b>governor</b> often uses the lieutenant <b>governor</b> {{as the head of}} board, agency, or commission.

5000|$|According to {{the state}} constitution, {{whenever}} {{the chair of the}} <b>governor</b> is vacant, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> shall take over as acting <b>governor.</b> The first time this came into use was five years after the constitution's adoption in 1785, when <b>Governor</b> John Hancock resigned the post, leaving Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> Thomas Cushing as acting <b>governor.</b> Most recently, Jane Swift became acting <b>governor</b> upon the resignation of Paul Cellucci. Under this system, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> retains his or her position and title as [...] "lieutenant governor" [...] and becomes acting <b>governor,</b> not <b>governor.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{executive}} branch {{is headed by}} the <b>governor</b> who serves as both head of state and head of government.

(Before 1992 the lieutenant <b>governor</b> assumed power any time the <b>governor</b> was out of the state.) The <b>governor</b> and lieutenant <b>governor</b> usually run on a single ticket (also per a 1992 constitutional amendment), and are elected to four-year terms.

25|$|A {{lieutenant}} <b>governor</b> {{can also}} serve as Acting <b>Governor.</b> When acting as the <b>governor,</b> the Oklahoma Constitution provides all {{the powers of the}} <b>governor</b> to the lieutenant <b>governor.</b> This includes the power of signing or vetoing legislation, making political appointments, calling out the Oklahoma National Guard, or granting pardons. The need for the lieutenant <b>governor</b> to act as the <b>governor</b> {{may be due to the}} <b>governor's</b> absence from the state, or his inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office. When acting as <b>governor,</b> the lieutenant <b>governor</b> holds the powers of the <b>governor</b> until the <b>governor</b> returns to the state or she is found to be able to resume her powers and duties.|$|R
5|$|The 1790 {{constitution}} {{abolished the}} council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with <b>governors</b> not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved {{the start of the}} term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed <b>governors</b> to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited <b>governors</b> from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow <b>governors</b> to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total {{as long as there is}} a four-year break after a second term.|$|E
5|$|The first Governor of Indiana, Jonathan Jennings, {{was elected}} in August 1816 and assumed office in December of that year.

The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824. <b>Governors</b> originally served three-years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851. The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned <b>governors</b> from serving consecutive terms. The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow <b>governors</b> to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time.|$|E
5|$|The {{governance}} {{of the university}} is conducted through the Board of <b>Governors</b> and the Senate, {{both of which were}} established in the Act to unite Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College in 1887.

Ex officio <b>governors</b> of the Board include the university's chancellor, president, {{and the chairman of the}} board-senate committee on long-range planning. The Board also consists of 34 other <b>governors,</b> either appointed or elected by the various members of the university's community, including elected representatives from the student body.

50|$|The Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> of Illinois is {{the second}} highest {{executive}} of the State of Illinois. In Illinois, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> and <b>governor</b> run on a joint ticket, and are directly elected by popular vote. Candidates for lieutenant <b>governor</b> ran separately in the primary from candidates for <b>governor</b> until 2014, when the system was changed to allow the gubernatorial nominee of a party to select the nominee for lieutenant <b>governor.</b> When the <b>Governor</b> of Illinois becomes unable to discharge the duties of that office, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> becomes acting <b>governor.</b> If the <b>Governor</b> dies, resigns or is removed from office, the lieutenant <b>governor</b> becomes <b>governor.</b> Under the Illinois Constitution, the Attorney General is next in line of succession to the <b>Governor's</b> office after the lieutenant <b>governor,</b> but does not succeed to the Lieutenant <b>Governor's</b> office. From the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich in 2009 until the inauguration of Sheila Simon in 2011, Attorney General Lisa Madigan would have become <b>Governor</b> if Pat Quinn had vacated the office.

5|$|While a territory, Indiana had two President-appointed <b>governors.</b> Since {{statehood}} in 1816, {{it has had}} 47 <b>governors,</b> serving 49 distinct terms; Isaac P. Gray and Henry F.

The shortest-serving governor is Henry Smith Lane, who served two days before resigning to become a U.S. Senator.

50|$|The Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> {{assumes the}} powers of the <b>Governor</b> of Texas when the <b>governor</b> is out of the state or {{otherwise}} unable to discharge the office.

Bush's first term and also during Bill Clements's two non-consecutive terms). The Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> becomes <b>Governor</b> if the elected <b>Governor</b> resigns, dies or is removed from office via impeachment and conviction. Former <b>Governor</b> Rick Perry took office upon George W. Bush's resignation on December 21, 2000. Bush became US President on January 20, 2001. When Perry became lieutenant <b>governor</b> on 19 January 1999, he became the first Republican since Albert Jennings Fountain in 1873 to serve as lieutenant <b>governor,</b> and the first Republican to be elected as Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> since James W.
