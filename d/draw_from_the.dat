Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|LaVey's estranged {{daughter}} Zeena Schreck, in an exposé {{about both}} her father's religion and past, attributes {{the birth of}} The Satanic Bible to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon. According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the 1968 horror film Rosemary's Baby, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and other occult practices. Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings {{he had already been}} distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in The Cloven Hoof, a Church of Satan newsletter.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation.

Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E

5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight.
