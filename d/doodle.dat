40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented {{a positive effect}} of <b>doodling</b> on individuals’ ability to recall information. However, previous research is limited to structured <b>doodling</b> tasks, such as shading in basic shapes. The present study extends the extant research, and increases the external validity of the previous findings, by considering the effects of multiple forms of <b>doodling</b> on recall. In this experimental study, ninety-three undergraduate participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of 4 conditions (control, structured <b>doodling,</b> unstructured <b>doodling,</b> or note-taking). Participants listened to a fictional dialogue between 2 friends discussing a recent earthquake and then completed a fill-in the blank quiz to test their recall of the conversational information. The results indicated that participants in the unstructured <b>doodling</b> condition performed significantly worse than those in the structured <b>doodling</b> and note-taking condition...|$|R

40|$|<b>Doodling</b> {{is a way}} {{of passing}} the time when bored by a lecture or {{telephone}} call. Does it improve or hinder attention to the primary task? To answer this question, 40 participants monitored a monotonous mock telephone message for the names of people coming to a party. Half of the group was randomly assigned to a 'doodling' condition where they shaded printed shapes while listening to the telephone call. The <b>doodling</b> group performed better on the monitoring task and recalled 29 % more information on a surprise memory test. Unlike many dual task situations, <b>doodling</b> while working can be beneficial. Future research could test whether <b>doodling</b> aids cognitive performance by reducing daydreaming.
