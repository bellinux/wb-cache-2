5000|$|Fairchild had {{not done}} well in the <b>digital</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> market. Their first line of ICs was the [...] "micrologic" [...] RTL (Resistor-Transistor-Logic) line which {{was used in the}} Apollo Guidance Computer. It had the {{advantage}} of being extremely simple - each inverter consisted of just one transistor and two resistors. The logic family had many drawbacks that had made it marginal for commercial purposes, and not well suited for military applications: the logic could only tolerate about 100 millivolts of noise - far too low for comfort. It was a while before Fairchild relied on more robust designs, such as DTL (diode-transistor-logic) which had much better noise margins.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} engineering, a logic {{family may}} refer {{to one of}} two related concepts. A logic family of monolithic <b>digital</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> devices is a group of electronic logic gates constructed using one of several different designs, usually with compatible logic levels and power supply characteristics within a family. Many logic families were produced as individual components, each containing one or a few related basic logical functions, which could be used as [...] "building-blocks" [...] to create systems or as so-called [...] "glue" [...] to interconnect more complex integrated circuits.A [...] "logic family" [...] may also refer to a set of techniques used to implement logic within VLSI integrated circuits such as central processors, memories, or other complex functions. Some such logic families use static techniques to minimize design complexity. Other such logic families, such as domino logic, use clocked dynamic techniques to minimize size, power consumption and delay.|$|E
