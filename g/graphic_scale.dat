50|$|Although {{the unit}} knot {{does not fit}} within the SI system, its {{retention}} for nautical and aviation use is important because standard nautical charts are on the Mercator projection and the scale varies with latitude. On a chart of the North Atlantic, the scale varies {{by a factor of}} two from Florida to Greenland. A single <b>graphic</b> <b>scale,</b> of the sort on many maps, would therefore be useless on such a chart. Since the length of a nautical mile, for practical purposes, is equivalent to about a minute of latitude, a distance in nautical miles on a chart can easily be measured by using dividers and the latitude scales {{on the sides of the}} chart. Recent British Admiralty charts have a latitude scale down the middle to make this even easier.|$|E

This helping process takes place through interpersonal contact between the nurse and individuals and groups.

Observation scales are the most appropriate technique for evaluating the effectiveness of interpersonal skills.

Thirty-six Ss were randomly assigned to three equal groups with each group using a different rating scale. The three scales used were the mixed standard scale, a <b>graphic</b> <b>scale</b> with descriptive cue points identical to those used in the mixed standard scale, and a <b>graphic</b> <b>scale</b> with non-descriptive cue points. The Ss viewed and rated three video-taped speeches using one of the scales. The results indicate no clear superiority of any one scale format in terms of halo, leniency, central tendency or reliability. There were, however, trends towards less halo and more central tendency when using the mixed standard scale. The differences between scales were very much dependent on the particular speech being rated. It was concluded that the mixed standard scale did not reduce the common rating errors...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Fresent study was to {{determine}} how two different data collection techniques would affect the Q-factors derived from several factor analytic procedures. Faculty members (N= 146) from seven middle schools responded to 61 items taken from an instrument designed to measure aspects of an idealized middle school culture; the instrument is the Middle School Description Survey (MSDS). In three of the schools, the data were collected using conventional Q-sort procedures. In the remaining four schools, data were collected using an unmarked <b>graphic</b> <b>scale.</b> Separate principal components Q-technique factor analyses were used with the data collected in each school, and results were rotated to the varimax criterion. For each of the seven Q-technique analyses, factor stability was assessed by consulting the magnitude of the eigenvalue of the first factor extracted, the mean eigenvalue of all extracted fac',ors, the average squared communality value, and the mean factor structure coefficient. Results indicate that the data collected via the unmarked <b>graphic</b> <b>scale</b> produced more stable and reliable Q-factors than did data collected via traditional Q-sort procedures.

40|$|Three {{algorithms}} {{for video}} scaling were developed and tested in software, for implementation on an FPGA. Two of the algorithms were implemented {{in a video}} scaler system. These two algorithms scale up with factors 1. 25 and 1. 875, which is used for scaling SD WIDE to HD resolution and SD WIDE to FullHD resolution, respectively. An algorithm with scaling factor 1. 5, scaling HD to FullHD, was also discussed, but not implemented. The video scaler was tested with a verilog testbench provided by ARM. When passing the testbench, the video scaler system was loaded on an FPGA. Results from the FPGA were compared with the software algorithms and the simulation results from the testbench. The video scaler implemented on the FPGA produced predictable results. Even though a fully functional video scaler was made, there were not time left to create the necessary software drivers and application software that {{would be needed to}} run the video scaler in real time with live video output. So a comparison of the output from the implemented algorithms is performed with common scaling algorithms used in video scalers, such as bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} rating scale formats on several indices of the {{usefulness}} of performance appraisal for employee development were examined. The job performance of 96 police officers was rated using simple <b>graphic</b> <b>scales</b> or one of two behaviorally oriented rating formats: behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) and behavior observation scales (BOS). As predicted, ratees’ satisfaction with performance appraisal was highest and their perceptions of performance goals most favorable when using BOS. In addition, performance improvement goals for officers rated using BOS were judged by experts to be most observable and specific. Contrary to the authors’ predictions, <b>graphic</b> rating <b>scales</b> were generally as good as BOS and as good as or better than BARS when evaluated in terms of ratee attitudes and goal characteristics. The results suggest that different behaviorally-oriented rating formats can enhance or inhibit the developmental applications of performance appraisal. Researchers and experts in performance appraisal have suggested two broad uses of appraisal in organizations (McGregor, 1957; Wexley, 1979). First, it serves administrative purposes {{in areas such as}} reward allocation (salary increases, bonuses) and assignment decisions (promotions, transfers, demo-tions).

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to uncover some of the {{psychological}} context of information literacy. It focuses on the connection between cognitive dispositions (IQ) and information behavior of preliterate children. The results show that pre-school children are able to extract information on subjects which are interesting for them from all available sources – ranging from traditional media such as books or magazines, modern digital media (computer, DVD) to natural conditions in which children live (city, nature). Surprisingly, the radio is used very rarely. If we compare subjective replies supported by the method of <b>graphic</b> <b>scaling,</b> we can see that gifted preschoolers obtain statistically significantly smaller share of information from TV or computer. It is also true that gifted children gain information on subjects interesting for them from a wider range of various media sources, they do not stick only to one of them (they do not sit “only” in front of a TV or a computer) ...|$|R
30|$|Consequently, we {{have two}} {{distinct}} scales: first, {{the scale of the}} domain of values that provides quantification of information and, on the other hand, the scale that provides us with the <b>graphic</b> <b>scale.</b> It is necessary to enhance a linear interpolation to set the colour that is assigned to each of the nodes, according to the amount of information associated with it. Once we have this colour range in the nodes, a graphical representation of the edges follows the same format representation. Using this visualization model by means of a chromatic scale in the graph, the result obtained for the graph where the nodes are the plazas in the area studied is shown in Fig. 5. Notably, the most important nodes in the plazas network are located not only in the city centre but in its historic centre, where the network of streets has a classic ancient layout with narrow streets and blocks forming irregular polygons shapes.|$|E

This study aims to {{investigate}} the use of hospitalized children's free drawings to assess the presence of post-operative pain in patients where language barriers previously prevented the use of existing pain assessment methods. This research involved 50 children ages 6 - 13 years, mostly from impoverished families, treated at the Red Cross Children's Hospital. The design is exploratory-descriptive in nature. The methodology was to collect drawings (110) on admission, after surgery (described as minor to moderate), when the children {{were expected to be}} experiencing pain, and also on discharge from hospital. These drawings were compared for picture content and children's responses to a combination of two scales developed and tested elsewhere (Word <b>Graphic</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Pain Ladder Scale), in an attempt to devise an alternative route to gauge subjective pain through drawings. Parental (44) and respondent (6) interviews provided information on parental reaction to children when in pain, and patient pain behaviour. Evidence suggests that children's free drawings can be successfully used in assessing the presence of pain but not the intensity thereof, and are recommended for use in the treatment process...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of internal features of the face has been a recurrent topic of debate. Two experiments were performed with upright and inverted schematic faces obtained through factorial combination of three internal features. Participants answered on a bipolar <b>graphic</b> <b>scale</b> of expressed hostility-friendliness, while their oculomotor behavior was simultaneously recorded. An averaging model was established in both experiments, which allowed deriving estimates of importance for each feature. Patterns of importance were different for upright and inverse faces. Oculomotor behavior was also different in both situations. However, no simple correspondence between estimated importance and oculomotor indices was observed. Outcomes suggest some trend for an inverse relation between importance and number/ duration of fixations, but also show that this sole trend cannot account {{for the whole of}} data. Attempts at assessing the {{relative importance}} of internal features of the face through patterns of eye movements {{have been made in the}} past. However, whether indices of oculomotor behavior do reflect the importance of looked at features is mainly the subject of reasonable assumptions (e. g., larger number of received fixations = more importance).
