Through the concept and frame analysis of EMS, we propose a method how to establish and run EMS. The method is to identify all energy factors firstly, analysis the energy factor to be controlled prioritily, then draw up to set up the management project and make the system document. All the energy factors in the system's document are required to be able measurable.

This report consists of five chapters which are Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results and Conclusion. The objectives of this project are study and identify the clauses of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 and develop the quality manual and system procedure according to the standard requirement for FKM laboratory. Studies and understanding the clauses is important before developing the quality manual and system procedure. This standard is divided to two main requirements which are management requirement and technical requirement. The management requirement of this standard is similar with the requirement of ISO 9001. The requirement of ISO 9001 was being studies. A workshop of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 was being attended to understand more clear on the clauses and some important information to develop the quality manual and system procedure. After that, one of the accredited MS ISO/IEC 17025 laboratories has been chosen to visit. It was also to understand more deep in developing the quality manual and system procedure; and ensures that the quality manual and system procedure is developing in the right path. The quality manual is developing as the policy and objective of the laboratory. The system procedure will been develop as a procedure to achieve the objective of the quality manual. The forms are creating as an evidence to support the requirements of the standard. The quality manual had been developed from clause 4. 9 to clause 4. 15 which is clauses of management requirement of the standard. The system procedure also had been developed for each of the clauses except the clause 4. 10 improvement. This clause not required any system procedure because this clause had related with the entire clause to ensure that the quality management system is continual improve. Some of the form had been created such as Non-Conforming Investigation Form, Corrective and Preventive Action Form.

40|$|This {{paper has}} focused {{much on the}} {{independence}} and performance of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. The research objectives of this project are {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the <b>management</b> in all council operations, to assess effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> controls both existing and proposed functions, to examine challenges faced by Chitungwiza municipality in upholding independence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and accountability including managementâ€™s behaviour, to determine types of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and their subsequent efficient methods at the council, to investigate how size and resourcing of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> affect objectivity and efficiency and to recommend strategies of establishing an effective and independent <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> In the literature review methods of measuring the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> activity were discussed in detail. This study provides empirical evidence as to the main factors influencing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness can be only enhanced through its independence; there are various factors that contribute to autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. These factors are namely competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> the size of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department, the relationship between internal and external auditors, <b>management</b> support for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. The results suggested that management should support the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and promote <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> autonomy from political interference. This would bring effectiveness of both the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and <b>management.</b> In this context, literature was also reviewed whereby different views were given towards autonym of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> was defined, forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> that <b>internal</b> auditors comply with such as Financial <b>audit,</b> Risk <b>management</b> and system controls, Advisory and investigative service and Performance audit. The researcher used research methodology that was mutually blended with both qualitative and quantitative research designs. The population for this research is 497 people constituting general employees (top <b>management,</b> lower level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees, councillors and the workers union members. The sample population is 50 and it constitutes 25 from the general lower level employees, 7 from the top management, 10 from councillors, 4 from <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees and 4 from the workers committee. The research tools used were interviews and questionnaires which had both open-ended and closed questions. Sampling techniques used are purposive, stratified and simple random sampling. Data was gathered from this targeted population through the use of face to face interviews and questionnaires. The researcher presented data which reveals different types and forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> Moreover, challenges that are faced by Chitungwiza municipality in enhancing independent <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> were unfolded by respondents. Respondents also cited that independence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> has different benefits such as effectiveness, accountability, transparency and efficiency. It was concluded that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> should be established outside the organisation. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>management</b> should be given motivational grades and salaries for them to be committed.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{competent}} <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff in South Africa is increasing significantly. Skills development initiatives are {{high on the}} agenda of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> profession globally. Prior research has addressed competencies in various professional disciplines, as well as general competencies for internal auditors, but little research has been done to determine the perceived levels of importance of the competency requirements specifically for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff. This study aims to expand this knowledge area, first by identifying the levels of importance accorded to the various competencies, as presented in formal professional guidance. Thereafter, these required levels of competencies for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> staff are compared with the perceived levels of importance ascribed to them by South African and global <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> leaders. The study found that there are inconsistencies in the categorisation of competencies and skills in the officially published <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> guidance. Despite this, the views of South African leaders do not differ significantly from their global counterparts, although it appears that the overall level of perceived importance held by those in <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> practice is higher than that in the published <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> guidance. It is recommended that the IIA standardise, align and revise its guidance on required competencies and skills.
