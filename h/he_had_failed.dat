5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (who coined the term cybernetics). He began writing science fiction at age 18 and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, Amazing published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Thus he was a well-known pulp writer at 21 – but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> German and MIT had dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} {{some readers}} to visit Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on, much to their consternation, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E

5|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan beat David Gilbert 10–7 in {{the first}} round. After the match, he refused to attend a {{mandatory}} press conference, and also {{refused to talk to}} the tournament broadcasters, the BBC. He received a formal warning from World Snooker, and was advised that further breaches of contract would lead to fines. In the second round, he lost 12–13 to Barry Hawkins, his first loss against Hawkins in 14 years and {{only the second time in}} 13 years that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to reach the World Championship quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Michael's cousin, Dan, then laid {{claim to}} Wallachia. Many of Michael's boyars (including the {{influential}} Albul and Utmeș) defected to the pretender. Dan crossed into Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, Michael {{was able to}} resist, but since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to implement all provisions of his 1419 treaty with the Ottoman Empire, his cousin was able to obtain military assistance from the Ottomans. Michael received support from Hungary, but their united forces were routed {{in the summer of}} 1420. Michael was killed on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2007 the Central Electoral Commission {{turned down}} Bukovsky's application, {{on the grounds}} that (1) <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to give {{information}} about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents, (2) he was holding a British residence permit, and (3) he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years. Bukovsky appealed against the decision at the RF Supreme Court on 28 December 2007 and, subsequently, before its cassation board on 15 January 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} {{closure of}} 150coal mines, {{some of which}} were not losing money, resulted in the loss {{of tens of thousands of}} jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities. Miners had helped bring down the Heath ministry, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed.</b> Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear, contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.|$|E
5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq {{to quell the}} Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E

5|$|Bremner {{was well}} {{established}} in the Scotland set-up, winning three under-23 caps, before he made his debut for Scotland in a 0–0 draw with Spain at Hampden Park. He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in the Group, which {{was not enough to}} qualify. He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received a black eye from Pelé's elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to intimidate Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.|$|E
5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> {{to live up to his}} own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive {{correlations between the}} diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings {{is based on the}} positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E

Norah Geraghty was Charley's razor, and he plunged boldly into the 'Cat and Whistle,' determined to draw it at once across his weasand, and sever himself for ever from all that is valuable in the world.|$|R
60|$|It is not {{necessary}} to call him a liar to touch his vanity. Tell a plains Indian that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> to steal horses from the neighbouring tribe, or tell a man living in bourgeois society that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> to pay his bills at the neighbouring grocer's, and the results are the same. Each, plains Indian and bourgeois, is smeared with a slightly different veneer, that is all. It requires a slightly different stick to scrape it off. The raw animals beneath are identical.|$|R

5|$|In {{his second}} season of basketball, Owumi joined Monroe Community College in Rochester, New York {{because he wanted to}} play for head coach Jerry Burns and his staff. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to receive any {{scholarship}} offers from Division I programs. On December 4, 2005, Owumi scored 26 points with eight three-pointers in a win over Rockland Community College. During his time at Monroe CC, he began drawing interest from teams such as Rutgers, San Diego State, and UCLA. A two-star recruit and the fifth-best junior college recruit in New York according to 247Sports.com, Owumi was recruited from Monroe CC by Samuel West and Jason Cable of Alcorn State.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> {{to find in the}} photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E

5|$|The case {{attracted}} commentary by two contemporary writers. John of Salisbury, who was {{a secretary}} for Theobald, added information about Osbert {{in a letter to}} Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter, John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Osbert, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary, Gilbert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, wrote to the pope to remind him that although Osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal, this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{first year}} of his reign was {{peaceful}} because the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, was still occupied with the internal consolidation of the Ottoman Empire. Michael supported Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire {{in the autumn of}} 1419. They captured the city of Turnu Severin that Michael's father had lost to the Ottomans, but it was put under Sigismund's control. In retaliation, the sultan broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses on the Danube to the Ottomans and to pay the tribute <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to send during the previous three years. Michael was also forced to send his two sons, Michael and Radu, as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly {{suffered from a}} lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>failed</b> to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E
