40|$|Abstract—Ontologies are broadly used in {{the context}} of {{networked}} <b>home</b> <b>environments.</b> With ontologies it is possible to define and store context information, as well as to model different kinds of physical environments. Ontologies are central to networked <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> as they carry the meaning. However, ontologies and the OWL language is complex. Several ontology visualization approaches have been developed to enhance the understanding of ontologies. The domain of networked <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> sets some special requirements for the ontology visualization approach. The visualization tool presented here, visualizes ontologies in a domainspecific way. It represents effectively the physical structures and spatial relationships of networked <b>home</b> <b>environments.</b> In addition, it provides extensive interaction possibilities for editing and manipulating the visualization. The tool shortens the gap from beginner to intermediate OWL ontology reader by visualizing instances in their actual locations and making OWL ontologies more interesting and concrete, and above all easier to comprehend.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} the user-customized interaction for intelligent <b>home</b> <b>environments.</b> The interactive system {{is based upon}} the integrated techniques using both speech and face recognition. For essential modules, the speech recognition and synthesis were basically used for a virtual interaction between user and the proposed system. In experiments, the real-time speech recognizer based on the HM-Net(Hidden Markov Network) was incorporated into the proposed system. Besides, the face identification was adopted to customize <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> for a specific user. In evaluation, the results showed that the proposed system was useful and easy to use for intelligent <b>home</b> <b>environments,</b> even though the performance of the speech recognizer was not better than the simulation results owing to the ambient noisy environments.
