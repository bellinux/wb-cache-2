5|$|Some {{solar power}} plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under {{scrutiny}} for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, {{in the case of}} concentrated {{solar power plants}} such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, studies have concluded that a significant number of birds and bats are injured or killed either by colliding into the <b>heliostat</b> mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E

2500|$|Very high {{temperatures}} {{are required to}} dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen. A catalyst is required to make the process operate at feasible temperatures.

[...] Hydrosol-2 is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería in Spain which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200°C to heat water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to the megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to <b>heliostat</b> fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.|$|E
2500|$|Power towers (also {{known as}} 'central tower' power plants or 'heliostat' power plants) capture and focus the sun's thermal energy with {{thousands}} of tracking mirrors (called heliostats) in roughly a two square mile field.

[...] Within the receiver the concentrated sunlight heats molten salt to over [...] [...] The heated molten salt then flows into a thermal storage tank where it is stored, maintaining 98% thermal efficiency, and eventually pumped to a steam generator.

Sight the distant object through the holes in the two bits of paper, A and B, at the ends of the horizontal stick; and when you are satisfied that the stick is properly adjusted and quite steady, take your mirror and throw the shadow of A upon B, and further endeavour to throw the white speck in the shadow of A, corresponding to its pin-hole in it, through the centre of the hole in B. Every now and then lay the mirror aside, and bend down to see that A B continues to be properly adjusted.|$|E
