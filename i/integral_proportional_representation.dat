40|$|Abstract. We study contact {{representations}} for planar graphs, with vertices {{represented by}} simple polygons and adjacencies {{represented by a}} point-contact or a side-contact between the corresponding polygons. Specifically, we consider <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representations,</b> where given vertex weights are represented by {{the areas of the}} corresponding polygons. Several natural optimization goals for such representations include minimizing the complexity of the polygons, the cartographic error, and the unused area. We describe optimal (with respect to complexity) constructive algorithms for <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representations</b> for general planar graphs and planar 2 -segment graphs, which include maximal outerplanar graphs and partial 2 -trees. Specifically, we show that: (a) 4 -sided polygons are necessary and sufficient for a point-contact <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> for any planar graph; (b) triangles are necessary and sufficient for point-contact <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> of partial 2 -trees; (c) trapezoids are necessary and sufficient for side-contact <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> of partial 2 -trees; (d) convex quadrilaterals are necessary and sufficient for hole-free side-contact <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> for maximal outer-planar graphs. ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Proportional</b> <b>Representation</b> Society of Ireland {{was founded}} on 20 April 1911 in Dublin.

The Society was initially a branch of its sister organisation in Great Britain, the <b>Proportional</b> <b>Representation</b> Society. [...] The Society's foundation was welcomed by several notable Irish politicians, including Arthur Griffith, who saw <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> as a way of ensuring that both the Unionist and Nationalist communities were fairly represented in Ireland once it had Home Rule. The electoral system endorsed by the Society was the single transferable vote (STV), combined with the quota counting method and multi-member constituencies.|$|R
25|$|Political {{scientists}} are divided on whether <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> increases voter turnout, though {{in countries with}} <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> voter turnout is higher. There are other systems that attempt to preserve both salience and proportionality, for example, the Mixed member <b>proportional</b> <b>representation</b> system in New Zealand (in operation since 1996), Germany, and several other countries. However, these tend to be complex electoral systems, {{and in some cases}} complexity appears to suppress voter turnout. The dual system in Germany, though, seems to have had no negative impact on voter turnout.|$|R
