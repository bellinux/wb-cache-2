5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{prayer is}} not a conversation. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence.

This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their fingers as they danced.|$|E

25|$|A new sight called Dynarange is {{currently}} being procured {{as part of the}} German Infantryman of the Future project. Essentially this is a computer controlled aiming sight with range finder. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> cope with the fact that some soldiers have had difficulties with the regular sight, as its scope is quite complex to the untrained eye. It would increases the weapon's effective range to 600 m (2,000ft) against moving and stationary targets. Dynarange is already in service with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps and the Dutch Army.|$|E

25|$|One concern {{regarding}} {{the intersection of}} medical ethics and humanitarian medical aid is how such assistance can be as harmful as {{it is helpful to}} the community being served. One such example being how political forces may control how foreign humanitarian aid can be utilized in the region <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be provided in. This would be congruous in situations where political strife could lead such aid being used in favor of one group over another. Another example of how foreign humanitarian aid can be misused in its intended community includes the possibility of dissonance forming between a foreign humanitarian aid group and the community being served. Examples of this could include the relationships being viewed between aid workers, style of dress, or the lack of education regarding local culture and customs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of {{liberalisation}} in 2002/03, there were only 180 ADMARC outlets. By 2009/10, the number of ADMARC-operated markets had grown to 788, and in 2010/11 the figure rose to 904. It remains {{under the control of}} politicians, and this has led to claims of corruption and the public perception that ADMARC does not act {{in the best interests of}} those <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> assist. ADMARC expanded in the decade after 2002 and still exists because of the failure of the agro-dealer programme to create an efficient private sector marketing system. This does not mean that ADMARC is efficient, it was heavily criticised in early 2013 for allowing stored grain to rot in its silos as many went hungry for lack of maize in ADMARC markets. Had that maize been released on the market before it spoiled, it was claimed, it would have helped to lower prices and prevented many having to queue for scarce maize.|$|E
25|$|Francis III {{remained}} Duke of Brittany, but died without attaining the French crown in 1536. He was {{succeeded by}} his brother Henry, {{who was the first}} person to become both King of France and Duke of Brittany in his own right. Any trace of Breton independence ended with the ascension of Henry, as Henry II of France, to the French throne. The French Crown and Breton Duchy were now united by inheritance, and the merging of Brittany into France was thus completed. Henry II was not crowned separately as Duke of Brittany. However Henry attempted to create a separate legal status for Brittany vis-a-vis the Kingdom of France similar to the position of the Duchy of Cornwall to the Kingdom of Great Britain. In some histories <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be a ducal territory he would attempt to preserve for himself and his heirs if he was to lose the French Crown. This attempt at legal separation did not survive his reign.|$|E

25|$|Central Acquisition Radar, a {{state of}} the art planar array S-Band radar {{operating}} on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180km, it can track while scan 200 fighter sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernisation programme and two of another variant were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware. The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant. The ROHINI has a more advanced Indian developed antenna in terms of power handling and beamforming technology while the REVATHI adds two axis stabilisation for operation in naval conditions, as well as extra naval modes.|$|E
500|$|Addressing his approach, Weisman {{said that}} {{eliminating}} {{the human element}} eliminated the [...] "fear factor" [...] that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> {{be read as a}} fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to [...] "today's romanticisation of nature" [...] in that it linked [...] "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" [...] with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the [...] "Nature knows best" [...] notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.|$|E
500|$|Hana (花, flower): In the Kadensho (Instructions on the Posture of the Flower), Zeami {{describes}} hana saying [...] "after you {{master the}} secrets of all things and exhaust the possibilities of every device, the hana that never vanishes still remains." [...] The true Noh performer seeks to cultivate a rarefied relationship with his audience {{similar to the way}} that one cultivates flowers. [...] What is notable about hana is that, like a flower, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be appreciated by any audience, no matter how lofty or how coarse his upbringing. [...] Hana comes in two forms. [...] Individual hana is the beauty of the flower of youth, which passes with time, while [...] "true hana" [...] is the flower of creating and sharing perfect beauty through performance.|$|E

At least we can trust him in God's hands, and believe that if this great woe <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> ennoble us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> ennoble him; that if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> educate us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> educate him; that God is teaching him; and that in God's school-house he is safe. For think, my friends, if we, who know him partly, love him much; then God, who knows him wholly, loves him more. And so God be with him, and with you, and with your prayers for him. Amen.|$|R
