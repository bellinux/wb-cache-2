5|$|September 5, 2004– Hurricane Frances {{strikes the}} {{southern}} end of Hutchinson Island as a slow-moving Category 2 hurricane, producing heavy rainfall peaking at 15.84inches (402mm) at High Springs. The hurricane damages 15,000homes and 2,400businesses in Palm Beach County alone, with damage across the state totaling $8.32billion (2004USD, $10.8billion 2017USD).

5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to {{regard it as}} a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is created}} by the {{long-lasting}} (up to thousands of years) s-process (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable indium isotope, indium-113, {{is one of the}} p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> s- and r-processes (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot account for all indium-113.|$|E

5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Balize, Louisiana was <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hurricane's path, and {{suffered}} heavily as a consequence. The storm lasted from the afternoon on Friday, September 14 to late Saturday morning. Local reports indicate heavy rain and large hail fell {{in association with}} the cyclone, and in Balize, nearly every structure was destroyed; any buildings that withstood the initial winds were swept away by the ensuing inundation. Floodwaters killed ten people at one location alone in Plaquemines Parish. Residents of the hardest-hit communities were forced to wade to safety, in some cases through water shoulder-high. Northerly winds drove water from Lake Pontchartrain that had already been built up by northeasterly winds southward over small fishing and resort towns along the southern bank of the lake. Sheds, wharves, and bathhouses along that section of the lake were destroyed. Several people drowned in flood waters that covered lower Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane drove several ships, including the steamer Galveston, ashore.|$|E
5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface of American life in the Depression was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E

5|$|The Stavka {{developed}} {{two major}} operations {{to be conducted}} against Axis forces near Stalingrad, Uranus and Saturn, and also planned for Operation Mars designed to engage German Army Group Center {{in an effort to}} distract reinforcements and to inflict as much damage as possible. Operation Uranus involved the use of large Soviet mechanized and infantry forces to encircle German and other Axis forces directly around Stalingrad. As preparations for the offensive commenced, the attack's starting points were positioned on stretches of front {{to the rear of the}} German Sixth Army, largely preventing the Germans from reinforcing those sectors quickly where Axis units were too overstretched to occupy effectively. The offensive was a double envelopment; Soviet mechanized forces would penetrate deep into the German rear, while another attack would be made closer to the German Sixth Army in an effort to attack German units there <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear. While the Red Army prepared, the German high commanders—influenced by their belief that the Red Army, building up opposite Germany Army Group Center to the north, was incapable of mounting a simultaneous offensive in the south—continued to deny the possibility of an impending Soviet offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{played only}} a limited, supporting role during the 1st Division's repulse of the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt in mid-April, and following this the battalion's next major action came in early May {{when it was}} involved in the Second Battle of Bullecourt. The day before the attack, the battalions of the 1st Brigade, despite being due for rest, had been attached to the 2nd Division, and they were subsequently employed to provide work parties to release reserves among the 2nd Division units to take part <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fighting. Having not yet recovered its losses from the fighting around Hermies, and being subjected to artillery bombardment during their approach to the front, the 2nd Battalion entered the line on 4 May with just 16 officers and 446 other ranks, subsequently relieving the 24th Battalion. As the Germans attempted to force the Australians back, the 2nd Battalion was moved around a number of times to shore up the line, until units of the 5th Division came up to relieve those of the 1st Brigade on 8 May.|$|E
5|$|The more neutron-rich {{darmstadtium}} isotopes are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies.

Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success, and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half-life of 5.7ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.|$|E
