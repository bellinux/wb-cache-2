50|$|On {{the evening}} of March 24, 1982, the station's building, {{situated}} {{on the side of}} Monte Sano overlooking Huntsville proper, caught fire and burned. Local firefighters could not control the blaze since the fire hydrant {{at the end of the}} driveway had not yet been connected to the water main and the water pressure at nearby hydrants was particularly low; this situation would later prompt competitor WHNT to relocate to downtown Huntsville, some years later. It was only a few days, however, before WAFF began broadcasting again through the auspices of local cable companies, who provided NBC programming feeds from WSMV-TV in Nashville and WVTM-TV in Birmingham, both of which were available in their own rights on many northern Alabama cable systems prior to 1990. Eventually, WAFF would rebuild at a <b>new</b> <b>location,</b> <b>occupying</b> a former jewelry store on North Memorial Parkway, some miles away from Monte Sano; microwave links connected the studios to the transmitter and tower. The fire would also prompt Huntsville city officials to repair the water pressure situation and build a new fire station atop Monte Sano, which sits directly across from WAAY's studios.|$|R

40|$|It {{has proven}} difficult, when {{focused only on}} {{biological}} determinants, to explain why some plant species become naturalized in or <b>invade</b> <b>new</b> <b>locations,</b> whereas others fail. We analyzed the invasion of Trifolium (true clover) species into New Zealand, assessing a range of human, biogeographic, and biological influences at three key invasion stages: introduction, naturalization, and spread. We used sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) to define suites of related attributes and aggregated boosted trees to model relationships with invasion outcomes. Human and biogeographic attributes were strongly associated with success at all stages. Whereas biogeographic attributes, notably large native range, were consistently associated with success, different human factors appeared to favor success at different stages, such as presence in early trade/immigration hotspots (introduction), intentional large-scale planting (naturalization), and frequent presence as a seed contaminant (relative spread rate). Biological traits were less strongly associated with success for introduction and spread and little if at all for naturalization; we found that tall perennials with long flowering periods were more frequently selected for introduction, whereas species with extended flowering in New Zealand spread more rapidly. In addition to causal relationships, the importance of human factors may reflect indirect associations, including ecological traits associated with both human use and invasion. Nevertheless, our results highlight key roles that humans can play in facilitating plant invasion via two pathways: (i) commercial introduction leading to widespread planting and concomitant naturalization and spread and (ii) unintentional introduction and spread of species associated with human activities, such as seed contaminants...|$|R
40|$|There is now {{overwhelming}} evidence that tumors typically comprise a single clone descended {{from a single}} founder cell. However, the conversion of a normal cell into a malignant cancer involves the ac-cumulation of multiple genetic changes. This is not surprising, since cancer development minimally re-quires the cell to acquire an extended life span, growth factor and substratum independence, the capacity to <b>invade</b> and colonize <b>new</b> <b>locations,</b> {{and the ability to}} recruit a new blood supply. Studies of the age incidence of various cancers (Armitage and Doll 1954) and mo-lecular analyses of the specific changes that occur at different stages (see, e. g., Fearon and Vogelstein 1990) indicate that at least six genetic changes typically ac-cumulate in a multistep process referred to as tumo...|$|R
40|$|Green crabs (Carcinus maenas) {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied {{because of the}} negative impacts that they have on the ecosystems that they invade. However, there are still substantial gaps of knowledge about their interactions and population dynamics. As green crabs continue to <b>invade</b> <b>new</b> <b>locations,</b> {{it is important to}} gain a deeper understanding of these subject areas in order to prevent or mitigate further introductions or spread. This thesis aims to address these knowledge gaps by focusing on two main topics: (1) green crab predator-prey interactions with smaller conspecifics and a native counterpart, the mud crab (Dyspanopeus sayi), and (2) a first attempt using a model to predict green crab population dynamics and the potential effects of a removal program. First, I analysed long-term observational beach-seine data collected from the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, and found that there was a negative association between native mud crabs and green crabs in this area. Then I used laboratory experiments to examine their predator-prey interactions and assessed the influence of habitat complexity on the outcome of these interactions. I found that green crab predators consumed almost twice as many mud crabs compared to juvenile green crabs in the two less structured habitats (no substrate or sandy substrate), but predation rates were statistically similar in oyster bed habitat. This study found that mud crab mortality was significantly affected by habitat type, whereas green crab mortality was not. I then focused on green crab cannibalism by adults on juveniles with similar laboratory experiments. In this study, I included habitat types that represented a wider range of structural complexity, and found that cannibalism rates declined with increasing habitat complexity. I also conducted field inclusion experiments that gathered similar results, though the differences were not significant. I identified knowledge gaps and areas of future research by gathering all the available information about green crab life stages. This population information was used to build a relatively simple stage-based population matrix model for green crabs. The outcome of the model estimated that a theoretical green crab population could increase by approximately 43 %. The outcome of this model also suggested that even if adult survival is set to zero (representing intensive trapping and effective removal of adults), the population was still able to grow because numbers in the other life stages were abundant enough to feed and maintain the population growth rate. These results suggests that current removal programs that catch mostly adults have little-to-no effect on the population growth rate, indicating that harvesting alone is unlikely to result in a reduction of annual green crab abundance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Manipulation through {{invasion}} is a {{major problem}} in most of the port areas in recent world. Mongla is an important sea port that has accomplished the activities like import and export of various goods inside and outside Bangladesh. The process not only involves the moving of goods, it also carries the invasive species purposely or accidentally which <b>invading</b> to the <b>new</b> <b>location</b> of the Mongla port area through exploration and colonization with varieties diversity and scale. The paper identifies the invasive species and analyses the causes and ways of invasion in the coastal waters with possible impacts of invasion in the Mongla Port area. To achieve the objectives of the research, different aquatic species were collected by random sampling from the confluence of the River Passur Mongla port and the adjacent area around the Sundarbans from September 2006 to April 2007. The fishermen and local communities including indigenous people were interviewed to explore the invasion situation. The research reveals that ballast water of cargo ships is one of the means of invasion of the coastal waters of Mongla Port. Aquaculture is another reason of invasion due to introduction of many exotic fishes and shrimp species such as Pangus (Pangasius sutchi), African Magur (Clarias gariepinus), Tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) and Nilotica (Oreochromis niloticus) etc. that have the active roles for altering the aquatic ecosystem of Mongla Port. Finally, the research also finds out some possible environmental impacts caused by those invasive species...|$|R
