For miles the valley was as light as at noonday. An awful beauty attended the scene. How lurid and sinister the red heart of that fire? How weird and hellish and impressive of destruction those black, mountain-high clouds of smoke! He saw the freight-cars disappear under this fierce blazing and smoking pall. He watched for what seemed <b>endless</b> moments. He <b>saw</b> the changes of that fire, swift and terrible. And only then did Kurt Dorn awaken to the full sense of the calamity.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{impact of}} the market failure that has befallen the {{residential}} real estate market {{during the past two}} years is well-known and self-evident, even if the underlying causes and remedies remain in controversy. Whether the market failure was caused by “predatory lenders,” whose only interest was in “churning product” to generate fees; “speculative developers,” who <b>saw</b> <b>endless</b> demand; “greedy securitizers,” who built a financial house of cards using over-leveraged derivative insurance contracts; “clueless speculators,” who thought the market values of real estate could only increase; or “hapless regulators,” who were under-funded and held in thrall to the industries they oversaw – the bottom line is that there is plenty of blame to go around. As a result of this market failure, primary and secondary market liquidity has slowed to a trickle, significantly reducing institutional and consumer credit for the first time since the late 1940 s...|$|R

40|$| in the superego. On {{the other}} hand Rakhsh’s help to Rostam in the third field, to {{overcome}} the dragon, {{is a symbol of}} assistance of the superego and the unconscious to Rostam’s mind. Khan IV Khan IV is killing the witch. Rostam: He sat in the saddle and took his way. He proceeded towards the magic house. He constantly went a long way; since the shining sun returned from the top. Rostam’s walk to the witch’s home refers to the greatness and turmoil of the unconscious. Evening (since the shining sun returned from the top) may have the state of being dilemma between light (self-awareness), unconscious (Super Ego) and the darkness. After passing the stage of ego, the hero’s mind enters the superego: He saw trees and vegetation and running water; it was likely a young man’s place. He saw a fountain like pheasants’ eye; a golden cup full of wine on the side. The tree is a symbol of being the archetypal example mother. Water is also a symbol of the archetypal example mother. Alcoholic beverage or wine is another symbol of the unconscious. The witch is a symbol of the Anima (Young, 1383 : 271). In fact, Rostam takes a major step forward in achieving individuality by defeating the witch that holds biological and instinctive aspect. In Khan V He constantly went vibrant and reached a place where it didn’t see lighting in the world. In this verse, Rostam enters the second degree in psychology, the ego.   But from the dilemma of this stage, we see the hero’s vibrant going ahead. That is itself a sign of the consciousness and brightness of the ego. Then Rostam enters the superego and his inner world gets totally unconscious: A dark night as the hero, black; No stars, no sun and the moon were found. As if the sun’s prisoner; and the star’s in the curvature of the lasso.  He gave the harness to Rakhsh, proceeded and for the black, saw neither elevation nor streams. Night, refers to the unconscious and the female origin. Among the indicators of unconscious that is turmoil here, are these two cases: A) the Sun’s being prisoner B) the star’s being in the curvature of the lasso that is a gateway from the logic and far from usual life. In the following verse, giving the harness to Rakhsh (according to being of Rakhsh or horse a symbol of the unconscious) is a sign of this that Rostam leaves himself in the subconscious. Rostam’s entering in the absolute darkness (unconsciousness) is a symbolic entry into mother’s womb and leaving is a symbol of rebirth. Another point is important in this Khan and it is that Rostam keeps his name conceal from the children. Predecessors, in a magic and introverted way, have known the name as the topest landmark and a celebrity’s representative and they thought that all human existence can be summarized and held in his name (Kazzazi, 1381 : 415). Another feature that can be seen again in this Khan is the lack of accurate time and place. Khan VI  “Olad”, here plays the role of sheikh that is the appearance of some moral traits. This way, after imprisoning Olad: He wrapped children on the tree; and grappled with him in the curvature of the lasso hard. He put the staff in the saddle; constantly went with a heart full of faith. In the first two verses, it is clear that Rostam spends the entity stage but in the third verse, he enters the stage of ego. And to maintain the balance between the entity and the super-ego, from both steps, holds features and characteristics. Putting the staff in the saddle, points to the first pan of ego, consciousness. Then, Rostam enters to third stage i. e. the super-ego. Once he bellowed among the group; as if the sea and the mountain was torn. When Arjang, the Deev, heard the cry, came out of the tent. In these verses, Rostam enters the super-ego. Tahamtan’s outrage {{can be seen as a}} symbol of the unconscious. Mountain is among other symbols of the example mother. "Tent is a symbol of the unconscious. Arjang, may be the last symbol of the efforts and struggles of ego, for durability. Khan VII Rostam, after killing Arjang, decides to kill The White Deev: With a head full of hatred and war and taut belt, came out of that position. When Rakhsh came to those seven mountains, robust Deevs were gathered there. It arrived near the <b>endless</b> cave; it <b>saw</b> around itself, Deevs’ army. In this verse again, the balance between the mind brightness (consciousness) and its darkness (subconscious) is placed. On the one hand, Rostam’s leaving and arrival, is a sign of consciousness. On {{the other hand}}, Deev’s being seen around the caves and wells (which are also the symbol of the unconscious) is the subconscious characteristic of the ego. Next verses are all full of super-ego and complete unconsciousness: From there, came like the shining sun to The White Deev. It saw a cave as a hell; Deev’s body disappeared from that darkness. Here, the determiner (that), refers to the entity. That is mentioned as “distance” due to being in the super Ego. But in Mirjalaleddin Kazzazi’s version, we read: He came with a heart full of fear and hope. Having a heart full of fear and hope is among other features of subconscious and dream. Cave is also another symbol of the unconscious. Deev’s disappearance of body from darkness is a pointer to its negative side (shadow) as well as the subconscious space: (Deev’s body disappeared from the darkness), filling the cave with Deev also shows the full control of shadow on this part. Deev’s hard battle against Rostam also is a pointer to the difficulty of one’s fight with his sensuality and evil forces. After that Rostam overcomes The White Deev and the sensual forces, comes out of the cave of unconsciousness and again takes steps toward self-awareness and goes to the Olad:  He came and opened the strap from the Olad and fastened the twisted lasso to the saddle. Conclusion Haft Khan is, in fact, Rostam’s battle of existential ego with different aspects and negative shades and Anima, to achieve being and perfection. Thus, to enter into his unconsciousness arena, he is forced to get away from the secular world and his conscious entity to the ego and from there to the superego. Obviously after every Khan (In fact, after leaving behind a test in the discharge of their belonging and demonic forces), Rostam returned to the entity and self-aware state again. And again before entering the next Khan, by providing the necessary conditions, he gradually leaves the entity and takes a step toward the superego and the coming test...|$|R
