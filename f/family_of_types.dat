Second, we show that Morley's theorem holds {{for the number of}} non isomorphic countable models omitting a countable <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>types.</b> We go further by giving examples showing that although this number can only take the values given by Morley's theorem, it can be different from the number of all non isomorphic countable models.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> a first-degree <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>type</b> II diabetes on fasting plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin in an outpatient clinical setting. Methods and results The study included 46 nondiabetic premenopausal overweight and obese women, aged 22 – 50 years. A total of 22 subjects had no <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>type</b> II diabetes until the third generation (FH−) and 24 subjects had a <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> <b>type</b> II diabetes (FH+), defined as having one or both parents with type II diabetes. Fasting plasma leptin and adiponectin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Leptin concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in FH+ than in FH− subjects. Moreover, after multiple regression analyses, both leptin (positively, p < 0. 01) and adiponectin (negatively, p < 0. 05) maintained a significant association with <b>family</b> history <b>of</b> diabetes, independently of age, body mass index, insulin resistance (estimated by homeostasis model assessment, HOMAIR), glucose, lipids, and blood pressure levels.
