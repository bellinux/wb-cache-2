40|$|Soils {{ranging in}} texture from sand to clay {{were used to}} compare {{permittivity}} measurements made using a Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe (SCIP) and time domain reflectometer (TDR). Measurements were made using the same electrodes embedded in each soil, making the measurements directly comparable. The objective of the work was to test a model describing the frequency response of the SCIP to both permittivity and <b>electrode</b> <b>conductance,</b> and to compare results with TDR and network analyzer measurements. The model was tested using liquids of known permittivity and in saline, dielectric solutions. Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe and TDR determined permittivity values are similar for sandy soils but diverge for loam and clay soils. Using Topp's values as a reference, the SCIP-determined permittivities for loams and clays lay close to the curve at water contents < 0. 25 m 3 m− 3, then often rose above the curve with increasing water content. Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe permittivity correction, using electrical conductivity (EC) measured at 1 kHz, corrected the results in sands reasonably well but not enough in loams and clays for reliable calibration. We propose three possible reasons for the higher than expected permittivity values observed using the SCIP: (i) higher than expected real permittivity created by dielectric dispersion, (ii) a large contribution of the imaginary permittivity due to relaxation processes assumed to be negligible, and (iii) poor model prediction of permittivity due to excessive damping of the oscillator circuit with high EC and dielectric losses. Results from network analyzer measurements {{for one of the}} clay soils were used to aid data interpretation. The TDR measurements were much more consistent, producing apparent relative permittivity values below those of the Topp curve for the finer textured soils. ...|$|E

40|$|Sensors {{incorporating}} zirconia electrolytes {{have been}} widely used for monitoring oxygen concentration and the air-to-fuel ratio of combustion systems. The aim of this work was to investigate the extension of this technology to other gases and to gas mixtures. Initial work was done on single zirconia. discs with porous metal electrodes on each face. Platinum, silver and gold electrodes were tested in controlled Atmospheres at temperatures between 300 *C and 850 *C. It was shown, as expected, that in 02 /N 2 mixtures electrode activity/conductance decreased as oxygen concentration and temperature were reduced. In CO/CO 2 /N, 2 atmospheres reproducibility was poor. Interestingly, an increase in <b>electrode</b> <b>conductance</b> of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude was observed as the temperature was reduced through around 700 *C which {{does not appear to have}} previously been reported. Is is thought to be related to the corrresponding change in the thermodynamic stability of CO at this temperature, ie 2 CO; ==t C 1 + C 02. Zirconia pump-gauges with small enclosed volume (< Imm 3) and laser drilled diffusion holes were constructed with the novel addition of reference electrodes. These were operated with current-interruption circuitry and rapid subsequent data aquisition. This enabled, for the first time, the overvoltage due to charge transfer on the internal pumping electrode to be isolated: interesting behaviour was revealed. The overvoltage increased as oxygen-containing gases were, reduced and then. in the case of NO, decreased as the reduction reached completion. The gauge EMF remained remarkably stable while NO was being reduced. Reduction of S 02 was shown to generate electronic conductivity in the yttria-stabilised zirconia. A potentially important result was obtained when operating a sensor in CO/CO 2 / 02 /N 2 mixtures where there was sufficient 02 present to oxidise all the CO present to C 02. With the application of zero pumping current the gauge EMF showed a substantial, non-zero, value. It was suspected that a mixed potential developed on the external electrode while the diffusion hole prevented its formation on the internal electrode. Based upon'the results obtained, two sensor designs are proposed. The first is a lean-bum combustion sensor eliminating the possibility of an ambiguous response in rich- and lean-bum conditions. By reducing the activity of the external pumping electrode while maintaining a highly active internal pumping electrode the response in rich-bum conditions would be insignificant while the response in leanbum conditions would be maintained. The second design concerns multi-gas sensing; it is based upon previous designs but the need for minimising electrochemical leakage was pinpointed by this work. Because overvoltages on the internal electrodes were shown to reach high values electrode activitity should be high and a gauge cell should be incorporated to provide information about the oxygen partial pressure within the sensor. If operated by sweeping the voltage applied it was shown that because of the slow electrode response the sweep rate would need to be less than 0. 2 mV/s. Consequently, it is proposed that an array of sensors operating at a range of fixed pump voltages would greatly reduce the response time. A computer-controlled apparatus was built with which to perform the experimental work. The apparatus controlled the furnace temperature, gas mixing apparatus and a potentiolstat/gaivanostat. The latter was purpose built so that all current and voltage ranges could be selected by the computer and current interruption performed automatically. Using software written in Turbo Pascal the apparatus was capable of performing a wide range of tests, unattended over periods of months...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells are a {{potential}} electrical power source that is silent, efficient, modular, {{and capable of}} operating {{on a wide variety}} of fuels. Unfortunately, current technologies are severely limited in that they provide sufficient power output only at very high temperatures (> 800 °C). One reason for this is because the electrodes have very poor (and poorly understood) kinetics. The work described in this dissertation involves the microfabrication of model systems with triple phase boundary lengths that varied over an order of magnitude to systematically quantify and ultimately improve the kinetics of platinum electrodes on the surface of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolytes. Platinum electrodes with well controlled geometry were sputtered onto the surface of bulk YSZ and onto sputtered YSZ thin films. An unexpected result was found whereby YSZ films of composition Y 0. 09 Zr 0. 91 O 2 -x had an ionic conductivity remarkably enhanced by a factor of 20 - 30. This is attributed to the films exhibiting nanometric grain sizes and thereby stabilizing the cubic morphology at considerably lower yttrium levels than is normally needed. This metastable cubic phase is suspected of having reduced defect ordering. (cont.) Grain boundary resistance, which in YSZ is normally due to impurities that segregate and block ionic transfer, was found to also be significantly reduced in YSZ films. The films had a specific grain boundary conductivity enhanced by a factor of 30 - 100 compared to the bulk polycrystalline sample. This was believed to be due to the very low impurity content of the film grain boundaries. Concerning the electrode polarization resistance, it was found that the electrodes placed on bulk standards and films deposited at high temperatures were on par with the best <b>electrode</b> <b>conductance</b> values from the literature. However, when the electrolyte surface was a film deposited at reduced temperature, the resistance decreased further by a factor of 300 - 500. The cause of this was revealed to be silicon contamination on the surfaces of the poorer-performing electrolytes. Triple phase boundary length-specific resistances as low as 3. 7 · 104 O·cm at 378 °C and 4. 0 · 107 O·cm at 215 °C were measured; these appear to be the lowest ever recorded. The measurements are possibly the first electrochemical characterization of nearly silicon-free YSZ surfaces. This study emphasizes the key role of chemical purity at the electrode-electrolyte interface. (cont.) Photolithography alone is unlikely to give technologically useful triple phase boundary lengths. In an attempt to achieve the triple phase boundary lengths needed for a practical device, reactive co-sputtering was used to produce composite Pt-YSZ thin films with a bi-continuous network morphology and grain sizes on the order of 30 nm. Such intimate mixing of the electronic and ionic conducting phases created an effective mixed ionic-electronic conductor with the entire surface of the film electrochemically active to the electrode reaction. The best processing conditions resulted in electrodes with an area specific polarization resistance less than 500 O·cm 2 at 400 °C and, by extrapolation, 10 O·cm 2 at 511 °C and 1 O·cm 2 at 608 °C. These films may enable operation of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell at intermediate temperatures (400 - 500 °C), and perhaps even lower temperatures with further microstructural optimization. by Joshua L.

Nowadays these materials are developed even in the nanotechnology area. In this paper we introduce instead of the volume conductivities either the surface conductivities or simply conductances. We also respect the contact conductances between a current supply electrode and the grid of surface conductances.
