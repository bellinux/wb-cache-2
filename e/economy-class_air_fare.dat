40|$|There are recent {{evidence}} that air transport demand {{may not have}} a perfectly reversible relationship with income and jet fuel prices, as is assumed in most demand models. However, it is not known if the imperfectly reversible effects of jet fuel price are a result of asymmetries in the supply side, i. e., asymmetries in cost pass through from fuel prices to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> or of demand side behavioral asymmetries whereby people value gains and losses differently. This paper uses US time series data and decomposes <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> and fuel price into three component series to develop an econometric model of air transport demand that is capable of capturing the potential imperfectly reversible relationships and test for {{the presence or absence of}} reversibility. We find that air transport demand shows asymmetry with respect to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> indicating potential imperfect reversibility in consumer behavior. We also find evidence of asymmetry and hysteresis in cost pass-through from jet fuel prices to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> showing rapid increases in airfare when fuel prices increases but a slower response in the opposite direction...|$|R

Many analysts are concerned about continuing changes in the industry {{in the wake of}} its consolidation in the last few years. The authors examine the competitiveness issue by developing a model for the determinants of <b>air</b> <b>fares.</b> They find that, controlling for other important factors, <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are lower on routes that have more caniers offering service, although most of the decrease in fares is achieved once two or three carriers offer service...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{approach}} to model capacity constraints in discrete choice with at least some capacity-related variables missing, like e. g. the price of a commodity. Airport choice models often do not contain <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> because of measurement difficulties as <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are often not included in passenger surveys and thus essential information regarding ticket price is lost to the researcher. Since <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> vary more across ticket categories at an airport than a ticket category varies across different airports, <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> related information cannot be reconstructed in many cases by the researcher. However, capacity constraints are becoming increasingly more important and thus including capacity constraints in airport choice models is reasonable. The model approach is based on individual utility maximisation and thus fits into the discrete choice framework. Furthermore, nonlinear programming is employed to find a feasible solution regarding capacity constraints. Thereby, detailed statements on how limited airport capacity changes traveller behaviour with regard to airport choice on the level of individual air travellers and airports are possible. The paper concludes with an empirical example to demonstrate the methodology and show the impact of limited airport capacity on airport choice of air travellers. ...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates to {{what extent}} an airline's {{financial}} distress impacts its pricing behavior. While prior research suggests that, on average, distressed airlines sell at lower fares, it is hypothesized that {{the magnitude of this}} effect may depend on certain firm and market specific contingencies. A large-scale empirical analysis using panel data from the US airline industry is conducted. The results indicate that firm financial distress and <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are generally negatively related. It is further shown that the magnitude of the effect of distress on fares decreases with the magnitude of operating costs and firm's market shares and increases with firm size and the level of market concentration.
