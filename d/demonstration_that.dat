5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} early and mid-1911, respectively, Edgar Quinet and Waldeck-Rousseau {{were assigned to}} the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1913, Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania. The demonstration was a protest of the Siege of Scutari during the First Balkan War; it succeeded in forcing the Serbian army to withdraw and allowing an international force to occupy the city.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{invasion}} of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the Ba'athist Iraqi government, it was swiftly recaptured by Saudi ground forces. The battle serves as a modern <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting {{the frequency of the}} actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E

5|$|In any case, {{the proof}} inaugurated {{a line of}} {{research}} that ultimately led, through the work of Bell in 1964 on Bell's theorem, and the experiments of Alain Aspect in 1982, to the <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> quantum physics either requires a notion of reality substantially {{different from that of}} classical physics, or must include nonlocality in apparent violation of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, {{producers}} Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, production designer Ken Adam {{and director}} of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. SPECTRE's shore fortress headquarters was changed to an extinct volcano after the team learned that the Japanese do not build castles by the sea. The group was due {{to return to the}} UK on a BOAC Boeing 707 flight (BOAC Flight 911) on 5 March 1966, but cancelled after being told they had a chance to watch a ninja <b>demonstration.</b> <b>That</b> flight crashed 25 minutes after takeoff, killing all on board. In Tokyo, the crew also found Hunt, who decided to go on holiday after having his request to direct declined. Hunt was invited to direct the second unit for You Only Live Twice and accepted the job.|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.|$|E

5|$|When Peng's grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng {{left home}} {{and worked at}} a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for {{thirteen}} {{hours a day for}} a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E
5|$|With Blood Money, Jones was {{determined}} to utilise the full colour range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter {{as opposed to the}} hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for Blood Money, while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into Blood Money. The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> Dailly had been working on.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{probably}} gave York to Geoffrey in {{the hope}} of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected {{to be out of the}} country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a <b>demonstration</b> <b>that</b> he could be harsh even with his own relatives.|$|E
