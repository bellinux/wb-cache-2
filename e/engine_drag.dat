5000|$|The Pégase was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane, notable for its unusual engine and for its fuselage construction.Externally {{it appeared to be}} a conventional single engine aircraft with a three blade propeller but its Mathis G16 engine was the result of combining two [...] Mathis G8 V-8s onto a single crankcase. The two units were connected to the propeller shaft with a free-wheel coupling in the reduction gearing so that if one failed, the other could continue to run. Thus the Pégase had only single <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> with the extra safety provided by two engines but none of the usual asymmetry issues associated with engine failure in a twin.|$|E
5000|$|Although the MD-11 {{program was}} {{launched}} in 1986, McDonnell Douglas started {{to search for a}} DC-10 derivative as early as 1976. Two versions were considered then, a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of 40 ft and a DC-10-30 stretched by 30 ft. That later version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over 5300 nmi km. At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the [...] "DC-10 global", aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the Boeing 747SP and its range were creating. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.|$|E
50|$|The {{mass flow}} through the engine is {{determined}} by the rotation rate of the engine, multiplied by the displacement of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed -RPM- in a vehicle or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see variable displacement). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> (see engine braking), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).|$|E
50|$|Electric dragsters {{have come}} of age with new {{developments}} in battery and motor technology. Electric motors powered by lithium cells can deliver power-to-weight ratios similar to high performance gasoline <b>engines.</b> <b>Drag</b> races last around ten seconds so battery range is not an issue. A number of electric dragbikes and dragsters (cars) are competing with Top Fuel classes. Electric drag racing records are listed at NEDRA.|$|R

50|$|The Toyota Prius has modest {{acceleration}} but has {{extremely high}} efficiency for a midsized four-door sedan: usually {{significantly better than}} 40 mpg (US) (5.9 l/100 km) is typical of brief city jaunts; 55 mpg (4.3 l/100 km) is not uncommon, especially for extended drives at modest speeds (a longer drive allows the engine to warm up fully). This is approximately twice the fuel efficiency of a similarly equipped four-door sedan with a conventional power train. Not all of the extra efficiency of the Prius {{is due to the}} HSD system: the Atkinson cycle engine itself was also designed specifically to minimize <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> via an offset crankshaft to minimize piston drag during the power stroke, and a unique intake system to prevent drag caused by manifold vacuum ("pumping losses") versus the normal Otto cycle in most engines. Furthermore, the Atkinson cycle recovers more energy per cycle than the Otto because of its longer power stroke. The downside of the Atkinson cycle is much reduced torque, particularly at low speed; but the HSD has enormous low-speed torque available from MG2.|$|E
50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem with}} the 801 was its poor {{altitude}} performance, due almost entirely to the single-stage two-speed, mechanically-driven supercharger it used. Since the 802 was not a necessity given the success and emerging flexibility of the 801's basic design, the engineers {{decided to take the}} time needed to address this problem by including an improved two-stage three-speed supercharger. The lowest-speed setting would not [...] "rob" [...] as much power at low altitudes, allowing the engine to produce 2,600 PS (1,912 kW) for takeoff, and still produce 1,600 PS (1,176 kW) at 12000 m. This was a dramatic improvement on the 801A's 1,600 PS (1,176 kW) for takeoff and 1,380 PS (1,015 kW) maximum at 4500 m, especially notable considering the engine was less than 30% larger in displacement. In addition, airflow through the engine had been carefully managed by the BMW aviation powerplant engineering team — via a forward cowl that seemed to owe much to the BMW-engineered, integral forward cowl design used for the 801 and its own forward cowl-contained oil cooling system — to enable the straightest possible path {{into and out of the}} engine. A twelve-blade fan (almost identical in appearance to the 801's own unit) and stator compressed incoming air, then fed into the supercharger; remaining air was channeled in three paths: through the intercooler and the front and rear cylinder baffles; all three streams rejoined behind the rearmost row of cylinders into the exhaust. The combination of the fan and ejector thrust from the exhaust balanced the total internal <b>engine</b> <b>drag.</b> The engine weighed 1530 kg, the same weight as the complex twinned Daimler-Benz DB 601s that comprised the troubled [...] "DB 606" [...] power systems, best known for powering the Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber, each of which generated some 2,700 PS (1,986 kW) at sea level for takeoff — the American Wright Duplex-Cyclone, however, only weighed 1,212 kg (2,670 lb) for nearly the same displacement and engine configuration as the 802. The 802 was eventually projected to be capable of producing , a power level that the Duplex-Cyclone would equal and surpass in the post-war years, up to some 2,610 kW (3,500 hp) through a trio of power-recovery turbines per engine in their exhaust systems in later subtypes, mechanically connected to the Duplex-Cyclone's crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{clay and}} sand mixture forms a white milky liquid called slurry.Slurry {{used to be}} pumped from the pit by a water-wheel and spilled into drags. Water-wheels were used to produce energy and run pumps, although later many in Cornwall were replaced by steam <b>engines.</b> <b>Drags</b> were concrete channels used to settle out Quartz and Mica sands from the clay. Later, clay had to be dried {{for a few days}} in settling pits. When it thickened to the consistency of single cream, the clay was channelled through pipes to settling tanks where it continued to dry for up to 3 months.Lastly, it was spread across the Pan Kiln’s floor made of porous pan tiles that allowed the heat through to finish drying.|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the air flow through the fan stage of a high bypass turbofan in engine-out conditions is proposed, to address the key performance issues of this severe case of off-design operation. Experiments are conducted in the new turbofan test rig of ISAE, specially suited to reproduce windmilling operation in an ambient ground setup. The engine is equipped with conventional measurements to characterize the cycle performance and directional five-hole probes are used to characterize the flow across the fan stage. These first results confirm {{the findings of the}} literature that the fan outlet guide vane operates under severe off-design angle-of-attack. Massive flow separation is expected in the stator vanes, generating an important pressure loss that contributes to <b>engine</b> <b>drag.</b> This comprehensive database will allow the calibration and validation of 3 D RANS simulations to provide {{a better understanding of the}} internal losses in windmilling conditions...|$|E
40|$|Several {{conceptual}} hypersonic research airplanes, designed {{within the}} constraints of a B- 52 launch aircraft, have been studied experimentally and analytically at Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 6. 0. Vehicles built to these criteria for Mach 6 cruise were shown to be feasible, if careful {{attention was paid to}} the low speed lift, drag, and high angle of attack stability to assure successful landings and transonic pitch angle maneuvers. The integrated scramjet <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> was high at subsonic speeds and appears to be constant with Reynolds number. The variable geometry airfoil used previously to improve directional stability was shown to be equally adaptable to the improvement of longitudinal stability. The vortex lattice theory gave good subsonic predictions of lift, drag due to lift, and pitching moments. Wind tunnel tests must be relied on for the drag at zero lift, trim, static margins and lateral-directional stability. The Gentry Hypersonic Arbitrary Body Program gave good predictions of the trends of lift, drag, and pitching moments with angle of attack at Mach numbers above 3, but the level of the values were not consistently predicted. No currently available theory or program gave accurate predictions of directional stability or dihedral effects at hypersonic speeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and drag parameters in the instantaneous fuel consumption model are explained {{by comparing the}} model with the original power-based model developed at Sydney University, and relating the two models to a conceptual model. Various efficiency factors internal to the vehicle system can be modelled as contributing to the efficiency parameter, or explicitly as power components. The single efficiency parameter in the original power model includes <b>engine</b> <b>drag</b> and all other internal inefficiency components of the vehicle system. On the other hand, the two efficiency parameters in the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) model have been derived {{in such a way}} that they do not include the engine/internal drag in the steady-state driving mode. A fuel consumption model that uses a drag force component measured by coast-down (in neutral) should employ a nonconstant efficiency factor (i. e. a factor dependent on speed and acceleration rates). Otherwise, a satisfactory level of accuracy cannot be achieved, particularly if the prediction of fuel consumption during different modes of driving is required. If all power terms are modelled explicitly, then a basic (constant) engine efficiency parameter can be employed. The basic efficiency factors found from engine maps are of the order of 0. 06 to 0. 08, which are very close to the values obtained for the ARRB model. This confirms the accuracy of the calibration method used for the ARRB model. ...|$|E
