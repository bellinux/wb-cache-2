5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} Trapdoor. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> of a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the 1990 Taylor Report, {{in the wake of the}} Hillsborough disaster, top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated. At the time three of the <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> of the ground had standing areas. The Enclosure, fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987–88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as 'the Ground', were standing and had to be replaced.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} which modification to a vascular puncture needle results in increased visualization during ultrasound (US) -guided vascular puncture. METHODS: We evaluated US {{images of a}} phantom made of degassed gelatin {{and each of the}} following four modified versions of a commercially available vascular puncture needle (18 G) : re-cut needle, dimple needle, rough-surface needle (rough over the sections of needle located 3 - 6 mm from the tip), and a needle with <b>four</b> <b>side</b> holes (side holes covered by the sheath). An unmodified commercially available puncture needle was used as a control. Five interventional radiologists evaluated image quality according to the following classification grade:&#x 2005;I, invisible; II, poor; III, moderate; IV, good; V, excellent. RESULTS: The highest score for needle visualization was obtained for the needle with <b>four</b> <b>side</b> holes. The re-cut needle scored the same as the control. Multiple comparisons were conducted using overall evaluation scores among the commercially available needle, dimple needle, rough-surface needle (3 - 6 mm), and the needle with <b>four</b> <b>side</b> holes. A significantly higher score was obtained for the needle with <b>four</b> <b>side</b> holes (P < 0. 05 / 6). CONCLUSION: The needle with <b>four</b> <b>side</b> holes was prominently visualized and gained a significantly higher score (compared with the other needles) in a phantom evaluation...|$|R
5|$|The Maktab Khana ("Clerk's Quarters") {{originally}} {{known as}} Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir, {{was constructed in}} 1617 {{under the supervision of}} Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir as a set of cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its <b>four</b> <b>sides.</b> Each iwan is flanked by arches.|$|E
5|$|The arena has a {{stand on}} each of the floor area's <b>four</b> <b>sides.</b> The {{northern}} part of the arena has two tiers for seating, while the south stand has only one tier for seating; the upper tier is reserved for executive suites and restaurant space. The southern stand also has 53 disabled places, with the same number of spaces for their companions. There are 36 entrances to the inner part of the arena. In {{the northern part of the}} arena, there are facilities for ice hockey practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for <b>Four</b> <b>Sides</b> to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play on {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|The second, smaller {{pavilion}} {{is known}} as the Tranofitaratra ("house of glass") and was constructed in 1862 under the orders of Ranavalona II. The queen would gather her ministers for counsel in this building, and the large windows on all <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> of the building provided a view of the countryside below, enabling the queen to ascertain the security of her surroundings. The glass used in the construction was imported by an Englishman named Parrett in 1862.|$|E
5|$|When the Vijayanagara Empire was {{in power}} in the 15th and 16th centuries, its {{workshops}} preferred granite over soapstone as the building material for temples. However, an archaeological discovery within the royal center at Vijayanagara has revealed the use of soapstone for stepped wells. These stepped wells are fashioned entirely of finely finished soapstone arranged symmetrically, with steps and landings descending to the water on <b>four</b> <b>sides.</b> This design shows strong affinities to the temple tanks of the Western Chalukya–Hoysala period.|$|E
5|$|After {{pinpointing}} Hambleton's location, the Air Force bombarded {{the area}} around him {{for the next three}} days. On April 4, a flight of ten Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, half the total available in all of South Vietnam, attempted {{to pave the way for}} a SAR team, and it was badly shot up. Eight of the ten aircraft were damaged, two severely. The damage significantly affected the availability of the Skyraiders.At dusk, Major Jimmy D. Kempton flying F-4D 66-0265 with the 390th TFS (Danang Gunfighters) and a wingman entered from the coast under a descending 500 foot ceiling and dropped BLU 52 SAR ordnance on <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> of Hambleton's location, the last of SAR ordnance on April 4.|$|E

5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
5|$|The double finial minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> have a {{decorative}} keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} on <b>four</b> <b>sides</b> {{by a series}} of walled cloisters, with seven different gates. Like those ancient royal temples of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, the Wat Phra Kaew complex is separated from the living quarters of the kings. Within these walls are buildings and structures for diverse purposes and of differing styles, reflecting the changing architecture during the various reigns of the kings. Despite this, most of the buildings within adhere strictly to classical Thai architecture. The establishment of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha dates to the very founding of the Grand Palace and Bangkok itself.|$|E
