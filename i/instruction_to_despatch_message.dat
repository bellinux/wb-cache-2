60|$|It is {{difficult}} for us {{in these days of}} steam and electricity to realise how long it took <b>to</b> <b>despatch</b> a <b>message</b> in the seventeenth century, even when the occasion was most pressing. Thus, Monmouth landed at Lyme on the morning of Thursday, the 11th of June. Gregory Alford, the Tory mayor of Lyme, instantly fled to Honiton, whence he <b>despatched</b> a messenger <b>to</b> the Privy Council. Yet it was five o'clock in the morning of Saturday, the 13th, before the news reached London, though the distance is but 156 miles.|$|R

All Owen's proceedings {{were based on}} the assumption, natural under the circumstances, of Manston's good faith, and that he would readily acquiesce in any arrangement which should clear up the mystery. 'But,' thought Edward, 'suppose--and Heaven forgive me, I cannot help supposing it--that Manston is not that honourable man, what will a young and inexperienced fellow like Owen do? Will he not be hoodwinked by some specious story or another, framed to last till Manston gets tired of poor Cytherea? And then the disclosure of the truth will ruin and blacken both their futures irremediably.' ...|$|R

So it is I {{have been able to get}} at this apparatus, and, assisted by a happy find among the material that is littered in this enormous store-cave, I have contrived <b>to</b> <b>despatch</b> these <b>messages.</b> So far not the slightest attempt has been made to interfere with me in this, though I have made it quite clear to Phi-oo that I am signalling to the earth.|$|R

When he had set them going he ascended the staircase of the great tower for some purpose that bore upon the forthcoming repairs of this part. Passing the door of the telegraph-room he heard little sounds from the instrument, which somebody was working. Only two people in the castle, to the best of his knowledge, knew the trick of this; Miss Power, and a page in her service called John. Miss De Stancy could also <b>despatch</b> <b>messages,</b> but she was at Myrtle Villa.|$|R
