40|$|Using the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm</b> as {{the main}} {{experimental}} device, various issues in trajectory and force control of manipulators were studied in this thesis. Since accurate modeling is important for any controller, issues of estimating the dynamic model of a manipulator and its load were addressed first. Practical and effective algorithms were developed fro the Newton-Euler equations to estimate the inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links. Load estimation was implemented both on PUMA 600 robot and on the MIT Serial Link Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Arm.</b> With the link estimation algorithm, the inertial parameters of the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> were obtained. For both load and link estimation results, the estimated parameters are good models of the actual system for control purposes since torques and forces can be predicted accurately from these estimated parameters. The estimated model of the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> was them used to evaluate trajectory following performance by feedforward and computed torque control algorithms. The experimental evaluations showed that the dynamic compensation can greatly improve trajectory following accuracy. Various stability issues of force control were studied next. It was determined {{that there are two}} types of instability in force control. Dynamic instability, present in all of the previous force control algorithms discussed in this thesis, is caused by the interaction of a manipulator with a stiff environment. Kinematics instability is present only in the hybrid control algorithm of Raibert and Craig, and is caused by the interaction of the inertia matrix with the Jacobian inverse coordinate transformation in the feedback path. Several methods were suggested and demonstrated experimentally to solve these stability problems. The result of the stability analyses were then incorporated in implementing a stable force/position controller on the direct <b>drive</b> <b>arm</b> by the modified resolved acceleration method using both joint torque and wrist force sensor feedbacks...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that people are adept at {{learning}} novel object dynamics, linking applied force and motion, when performing reaching movements with hand-held objects. Here we investigated whether the control of rapid corrective arm responses, elicited in response to visual perturbations, has access to such newly acquired knowledge of object dynamics. Participants first learned to make reaching movements while grasping an object subjected to complex load forces that depended on the distance and angle of the hand from the start position. During a subsequent test phase, we examined grip and load force coordination during corrective arm movements elicited (within similar to 150 ms) in response to viewed sudden lateral shifts (1. 5 cm) in target or object position. We hypothesized that, if knowledge of object dynamics is incorporated in the control of the corrective responses, grip force changes would anticipate the unusual load force changes associated with the corrective arm movements so as to support grasp stability. Indeed, we found that the participants generated grip force adjustments tightly coupled, both spatially and temporally, to the load force changes associated with the arm movement corrections. We submit that recently learned novel object dynamics are effectively integrated into sensorimotor control policies that support rapid visually <b>driven</b> <b>arm</b> corrective actions during transport of hand held objects...|$|E

40|$|The model-based {{approach}} in control engineering works well when a reliable plant model is available. However, in practice, reliable models seldom exist: instead, typical “levels” of limited reliability occur. For instance, Computed Torque Control (CTC) in robotics assumes almost perfect models. The Adaptive Inverse Dynamics Controller (AIDC) and the Slotine Li Adaptive Robot Controller (SLARC) assume absolutely correct analytical model form, and only allows imprecise knowledge regarding the actual {{values of the}} model parameters. Neglecting the effects of dynamically coupled subsystems, and allowing the action of unknown external disturbances means {{a higher level of}} corrupted model reliability. Friction-related problems are typical examples of this case. In the traditional control literature, such problems are tackled by either drastic “robust” or rather intricate “adaptive” solutions, both designed by the use of Lyapunov’s 2 nd method that is a complicated technique requiring advanced mathematical skills from the designer. As an alternative design methodology, the use of Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT) was suggested, which concentrates on guaranteeing the prescribed details of tracking error relaxation via generation of iterative control signal sequences that converge on the basis of Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem. This approach is essentially based on the fresh data collected by observing the behavior of the controlled systems, rather than {{in the case of the}} traditional ones. For the first time, this technique is applied for order reduction in the adaptive control of a strongly nonlinear plant with significant model imprecisions: the control of a DC motor <b>driven</b> <b>arm</b> in dynamic interaction with a nonlinear environment is demonstrated via numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} approach toward {{development of a}} serially connected robotic arm meant for physical Human Robot Interaction. The motivation starts from the effort in incorporating a property of the manipulator, attributing to “Intrinsically Safe” robot. In {{the advent of the}} thesis work, a review of state-of-the-art is carried out in finding a suitable metric (or, a collection of safety measures) to quantify impact/collision related physical safety, concerning physical interaction between robot and human. The dominant property of a robot contributing to potential safety hazards are its inertia and speed of operation. With conventional robots for safety critical physically interactive applications, this speed is kept below rather a low value leading to loss of productivity. Away from the conventional approach, the thesis-work then proceeds to follow a design concept - design for safety first and control it for performance. The concept follows an inertia attenuating approach in an optimal way in doing a trade off between safety (impact) and performance. In this respect of seeing safety (due to impact) of human as a function of effective inertia, nonetheless, restricts the size of inertia of robot links to be low compared to human. The identified fact of maximum energy transfer at impact requiring equal inertias of colliding bodies put this restriction to make inertia attenuating approaches effective. This aspect had not yet been completely explained in literature; attenuating inertia does not help in increasing relative safety, unless the robot link inertia is low compared to the mass of an object, whose safety is in concern and then the total inertia (from motor) attains an equal value. Reducing the effect of the sources of impact hazards, a safe design culminates in assembling a lightweight structure, possessing compliant components, for example, by putting considerable flexibilities in transmissions (apart from soft cover/skin). The loss of performance in placing compliance is recovered by varying the transmissio impedance/stiffness. The Variable Impedance Actuation (VIA) evolves. The VIA, or, a class of it, the Variable Stiffness Actuation(VSA) is an outcome of a time optimal task planning problem for strict safety constraint with variable joint impedance during motion. Performance of a flexible jointed robot is enhanced with variable impedance/stiffness and obtained are two desired trajectories for a specified task, one for velocity and the second for stiffness, leading to Stiff-&-Slow and Soft-&-Fast paradigms. The thesis-work follows the method of antagonistic actuation through nonlinear transmissions in putting forth stiffness variation and motion control. In this activity, a new non-linear transmission element is developed from a first principle learnt from biological muscle characteristics, which leads to a spring with exponential force-length characteristic. A systematic general method is developed to realize mechanically any arbitrary spring of continuous monotonic force-length function, using profile cam. The dissertation proceeds to address design and analysis of tendon structures for serially connected arm - the notion of Tendon Manipulablity and Stiffness Controllability are introduced and elaborated. Role of joint-space redundancy is considered for task-space-stiffness control. Finally, design of a base-actuated tendon driven system with 2 -degrees of joint-space-redundancy is presented; the serial manipulator arm possess a 3 -dof intersecting shoulder and two elbows. Concept of tendon driven differential shoulder is delineated in the context. The first partial prototype of the fore arm consisting of two Rollarticular elbows is developed in laboratory and assembled. For a single-degree-of-freedom joint, there are two actuators in antagonism, while in minimally manipulable n-degrees-of-freedom arm there can be (n + 1) to 2 n actuators with varied degree of stiffness controllability in joint and taskspace. All these attributes tend to converge to emulation of a biological system - the human arm. The requirement of being lightweight, stiffnes variable and biomorphic almost uniquely converge to a tendon <b>driven</b> <b>arm.</b> A new rolling type hingeless joint, developed in the thesis work adds to the biomorphic design of the robot joint. This, named as Rollarticular joint, introduces a completely new joint type, unlike the conventional robotic joints found in literature and industry. The new joint is then formalized with robotic convention and terminology. Rollarticular joint offers a joint particularly suitable for tendon actuation. Use of Rollarticular mechanism makes it possible to decouple the tendon movements while passing through successive joints from distal end to base (assuming all the joints possess the same mechanism). This pertains to stiffness controllability - even the minimally manipulable tendon <b>driven</b> <b>arm</b> becomes completely joint stiffness controllable, unlike coupled n + 1 or 2 n arrangements with hinge joints. The final part of the dissertation considers the control aspects. An elaborate review of control of flexible joint robots (fixed compliance) is presented. A very recent method of feedback-linearization based control for variable stiffness actuation is studied in comparison with a new method proposed here. The thesis proposes a force sensor (tendon tension sensors) based impedance controller for the simultaneous control of motion and stiffness for task following(planned velocity and stiffness trajectories for stiff-slow and soft-fast motion). Unlike most of the other approaches found in literature, the proposed method is sensor based (position, velocity states and force), which avoids parameter uncertainties of model based approaches and becomes less computationally involved. The approach assumes an ideal behaviour of the sensors (at present ignores force sensor signal noise). The notion of dependency of input-settable stiffness on the null-space component of antagonistic tendon forces is identified; in this method, stiffness is estimated in terms of the sensed internal force components. This reduces further online computational burden. This novel approach, based on the internal tendon forces, hence implements a controller for simultaneous motion and stiffness trajectory following in a very simple manner. Identifying input-dependent stiffness lying in the null space of antagonistic system and applying them in stiffness control is one of the new contributions of this thesis...|$|E
