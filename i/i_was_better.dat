500|$|He again played Harry Osborn in Spider-Man 3 (2007). In {{contrast}} to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891million, it stands as the most successful film in the series, and Franco's highest-grossing film to date. In this same year, Franco made a cameo appearance as himself in the Apatow-directed comedy Knocked Up, which starred Freaks and Geeks alumni Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Martin Starr. Franco co-starred with Sienna Miller in the low-budget independent film Camille, a dark fantasy dramedy about a young newlywed couple and Interview, where he appears in a voice only role, both 2007 movies that were ignored by audiences and critics alike. Among his other 2007 projects were Good Time Max, which Franco wrote, directed and starred in. The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and centers around two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going {{on to become a}} doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs. The actor chose to cast himself in that role because, [...] "It was really just a process of elimination. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> suited for this role than the responsible surgeon".|$|E
2500|$|Performing in Westerns was {{a return}} {{to what he had}} done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre. [...] In a 1978 interview, he said: I liked doing comedies, but as I got older <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes un{{attractive}} for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western. The minute I got a horse and a hat and a pair of boots on, I felt easier. I didn't feel like I was an actor anymore. I felt like I was the guy out there doing it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know. I {{slipped on}} the {{sidewalk}} and turned my ankle. I could not walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better.</b> That is why I was so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to ask}} you this," [...] he said. [...] "What should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> the <b>better</b> for it all? What use have I {{for friends}} who only gather round me because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> rich? Shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> off to {{have nothing to do with}} them, to live my own life, and make my own pleasures?" ...|$|R

60|$|When {{we reached}} the opening at the top Tars Tarkas drew to one side that I might pass out and investigate, as, owing to my lesser weight and greater agility, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> fitted for the perilous {{threading}} of this dizzy, hanging pathway.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps they replied, or {{argued the}} point, {{or tried to}} {{encourage}} {{me to believe that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did, except that they forbore to remove me.|$|E
30|$|Consider the {{following}} three cases: First, the conditional mean regression shows that State <b>I</b> <b>is</b> superior to State II and that proposition is correct directly. Second, the quantile regression shows that state <b>I</b> <b>is</b> superior to state II, and the proposition is correct. Thirdly, the conditional mean regression shows that State III is superior to State II and the quantile regression shows that State <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than State III. One can then conclude that State <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> than State II. As a result, the proposition holds through the transitivity.|$|R

6000|$|Averil drew in her breath, and {{squeezed}} both hands tight on her chest, {{as she spoke}} very low: 'They sent me away from mamma--they told me papa wanted me: then they sent me from him; they said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> with Leonard; and--and I said to myself, nothing should make me leave Leonard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled, but {{her voice}} was tremulous. [...] "Don't worry about me. I'm all right again--at least <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>better.</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> happy if only you are successful." ...|$|R
