Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone by that name. In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and cut his wrist with a shard of <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E

These spheres became the lenses of his microscopes, with the smallest spheres providing the highest magnifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is cast in reflective <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cylindrical shape that reflects {{much of the}} downtown skyline (though each of the around 5600 windows are flat and not convex). Another small cylinder runs the full height of the building on one side, and accommodates two scenic elevators.

The top floor of the restaurant completes a full revolution every 30 minutes, and the bottom every 60 minutes.|$|E
25|$|A {{new method}} of {{producing}} glass, {{known as the}} cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process {{was used by the}} Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new and innovative structure.|$|E

25|$|The north {{window in}} the {{sanctuary}} is unique as it combines tracery and sculpture with stained <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single theme. It shows the ascent of Christ from Jesse. The tree with five undulating branches carved in foliage rises from the sculptured recumbent form of Jesse. Much of the 14th-century glass is fragmentary, but still in its original tracery. The figures of Christ and the Virgin and Child with other figures are intact. The glass contains figures from a Tree of Jesse and additional figures are carved on stone mullions.|$|E
25|$|The {{last major}} {{components}} {{to be put}} into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, {{it is clear}} that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around {{a relatively small number of}} workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited {{evidence for}} local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool {{improved}} their League performances {{over the next}} two years, finishing third in 1967–68 and then second in 1968–69, although to Shankly himself it was [...] "a mediocre time in the late 1960s as we prepared for the 1970s". Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped. In 1967, he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record £96,000 and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later. He claimed bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace; Shankly compared the latter to Tom Finney. In September 1968, Shankly paid £100,000 to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became [...] "football's first £100,000 teenager". Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa. Shankly recalled that Evans was scarred by a <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nightclub incident which, in Shankly's opinion, had a detrimental impact on his career.|$|E
