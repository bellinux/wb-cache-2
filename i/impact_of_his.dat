His {{first novel}} since Yo, el Supremo, Vigilia del admirante (1992; Vigil of the Admiral) was {{published}} in 1992, and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor) the following year.

5|$|Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's {{political}} influence {{was on the}} rise. He had begun associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest. Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the publisher of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> agenda on the Romanian public. Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Nicolae Titulescu for their main targets.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I am {{curious to}} know what {{conditions}} Jim faces during his escapes and what the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dealing with white people are as seen in one of Mark Twain?s novels, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. In order to analyze the novel and support the analysis, I use literary approach, by applying the theories of characterization and conflict. I also use the concept of freedom versus slavery {{to support my thesis}} as the historical background of slavery in America. The analysis is done firstly by studying the conditions that the main character, Jim faces during his escapes. I found that Jim has to encounter physical suffering, fear, and guilt so as to gain his freedom. Afterwards, I tried to look at the <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dealing with white people. It is found that the struggle has changed the white people?s perspective on the black people?s intelligence as well as sensitivity. Finally, I gain an insight from this study that freedom is not given, but must be earned...|$|R

5|$|Two further series {{ideas were}} {{developed}} from Roddenberry's notes, Genesis and Andromeda. After an initial order for two seasons, 110 episodes of Andromeda were aired over five seasons. Tribune also worked on another Roddenberry series. Titled Starship; they aimed to launch it via the network route rather than into syndication.

5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for Venice {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special gift to the coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} poet Imadaddin Nasimi, Khatā'ī is {{considered}} to be among the first proponents of using a simpler Azeri language in verse that would appeal to a broader audience.

The major <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> religious writings, in the long run, was the conversion of Persia from Sunni to Shia Islam.|$|E
25|$|The Kokutai Genri-ha {{had long}} {{supported}} a violent uprising against the government. The decision to finally act in February 1936 {{was caused by}} two factors. The first was the decision announced in December 1935 to transfer the 1st Division, to {{which most of the}} Kokutai Genri-ha's officers belonged, to Manchuria in the spring. This meant that if the officers did not strike before then, any possible action would be delayed by years. The second was Aizawa's trial. The <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions had impressed the officers, and they believed that by acting while his trial was still going on, they could take advantage of the favorable public opinion it was engendering.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he won a}} {{competition}} to become professor of Romanian language and literature at Saint Sava National College. Later that year, {{with the help of}} his former professor Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in Milan and Paris. He met the Romanist Émile Picot, took courses with Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and Gaston Paris, but the lasting <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries. Impressed by the Palazzo Brera, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, libraries across Italy, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, he at the same time became keenly aware of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.|$|E

25|$|Li Zicheng's {{rebellion}} was {{a peasant}} rebellion {{aimed at the}} overthrow of the Ming dynasty; it led to the establishment of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Li Zicheng began recruiting troops at Xi'an in Shaanxi province, and later went on and gained power throughout northeastern China. From 1620, {{towards the end of the}} Wanli Emperor's reign, social and economic conditions under Ming rule worsened drastically. Li Zicheng did not become the emperor, but he paved the way for the rising of the new Qing dynasty, after overthrowing the Ming emperor by capturing Beijing. The Qing troops, arriving from the northeast (originally from Manchuria) were allied with Wu Sangui, a former Ming general, an alliance which eventually lead to the defeat of Li Zicheng, though the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rebellion were tremendous.|$|E
25|$|Edison was a {{prolific}} inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, {{as well as}} many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution to homes, businesses, and factories – a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
25|$|Pearce's revolutionary designs came to {{be studied}} and copied {{both at home and}} abroad. The Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle imitated his top-lit corridors, {{although}} with minor alterations that undermined the effect somewhat. The British Museum in Bloomsbury in London copied his colonnaded main entrance for its own facade. The <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> designs stretched as far as Washington, D.C., where Pearce's building, and in particular his octagonal House of Commons chamber, was studied as plans were made for the new United States Capitol building. While the shape of the chamber was not replicated, some of its decorative motifs were, with the ceiling structure in the Old Senate Chamber and old House of Representatives chamber (now the Statuary Hall) holding a striking resemblance to the original Pearce-designed ceiling in the original Irish House of Commons. Coincidentally, while the Capitol was copying aspects of the design of Dublin's Parliament House, the White House was being modelled on the ground and first floors of Leinster House, then the residence of the Duke of Leinster, one of the leading peers in the Irish House of Lords, and now the seat of the modern independent Irish parliament, Oireachtas Éireann.|$|E
