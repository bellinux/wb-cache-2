5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter <b>had</b> <b>family</b> ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E

5|$|Lie {{was born}} in Buitenzorg (now Bogor), West Java, on 1 November 1853, the first child of seven born to Lie Hian Tjouw and his second wife Oey Tjiok Nio. The elder Lie had four {{children}} from a previous marriage, with Lie Kim Hok his first child from the new marriage. The well-to-do peranakan Chinese couple was living in Cianjur at the time but went to Buitenzorg, Lie Hian Tjouw's hometown, for the birth as they <b>had</b> <b>family</b> there. The family soon returned to Cianjur, where Lie Kim Hok was homeschooled in Chinese tradition and the local Sundanese culture and language. By age seven he could haltingly read Sundanese and Malay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois <b>had</b> <b>family</b> ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, were eager {{to fight against the}} British Band.|$|E
5|$|In December, Kan Ek' {{despatched}} AjChan {{to negotiate}} peace with Spain, with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida {{by a small}} number of Mopans from the Tipuj region. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also <b>had</b> <b>family</b> ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from Chichen Itza in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza–Kowoj hostility. Kan Ek' sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain. The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery. The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.|$|E

25|$|This is true {{especially}} in the Ming-Qing dynasties, when the social status of merchants had rose to such significance that by the late Ming period, many scholar-officials were unabashed to declare publicly in their official family histories that they <b>had</b> <b>family</b> members who were merchants. Consequently, while Confucianism did not actively promote profit seeking, it did not hinder China’s commercial development either.|$|E
25|$|The military, {{originally}} {{calling itself}} the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch (CDRM), {{issued a statement}} citing the government's alleged lèse majesté, corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup.

25|$|Silhak {{scholars}} perceived Christianity {{as providing}} an ideological {{basis for their}} beliefs and were therefore attracted to {{what they saw as}} the egalitarian values of Christianity. When Christianity was finally established in Korea in the 18th century, there was already a substantial body of educated opinion sympathetic to it, which was crucial to the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s. An 1801 study indicated that 55% of all Catholics <b>had</b> <b>family</b> ties to the Silhak school.|$|E

Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined that these people had post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish {{forced the}} Acadians they had transported to settle along the Mississippi River, to block British expansion, rather than Western Louisiana {{where many of}} them <b>had</b> <b>family</b> and friends and where it was much easier to farm. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent {{infantry}} from other colonies {{to put down the}} rebellion and execute the leaders.
