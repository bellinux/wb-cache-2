50|$|Fluorescence {{intensity}} detection {{has developed}} very broadly in the microplate format {{over the last}} two decades. The range of applications is much broader than when using absorbance detection, but instrumentation is usually more expensive. In this type of instrumentation, a first optical system (<b>excitation</b> <b>system)</b> illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator). As a result of the illumination, the sample emits light (it fluoresces) and a second optical system (emission system) collects the emitted light, separates it from the excitation light (using a filter or monochromator system), and measures the signal using a light detector such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The advantages of fluorescence detection over absorbance detection are sensitivity, as well as application range, given the wide selection of fluorescent labels available today. For example, a technique known as calcium imaging measures fluorescence intensity of calcium-sensitive dyes to assess intracellular calcium levels.|$|E
5000|$|This model {{created by}} John Bancroft and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the {{individual}} variability of sexual response. They postulate that this variability {{depends on the}} interaction between an individual's sexual <b>excitation</b> <b>system</b> (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book Come as You Are, the SES {{has been described as}} the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'. [...] The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels. A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors. These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). [...] The SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates. Female focus groups found that the context of the emotional relationship between sexual partners was not fully represented in the original SIS/SES questionnaire. A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI). This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender. One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.|$|E

40|$|The voltage {{regulator}} and the <b>excitation</b> <b>system</b> {{are known to}} affect strongly the dynamic stability of a synchronous generator. This effect is often detrimental, sometimes leading even to dynamic instability. This paper concentrates on determining the <b>excitation</b> <b>system</b> parameter values for which the generator's dynamic stability becomes marginal. This defines a stable and an unstable region {{in the space of}} the dominant <b>excitation</b> <b>system</b> parameters, namely the transient or the steady state gain and the dominant time constant of the excitor-{{voltage regulator}} system. In the case of a first order <b>excitation</b> <b>system</b> model, the stability limits can be determined analytically {{in the form of an}} inequality constraint.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{behaviour}} {{of two different}} control structures of automatic voltage regulators of synchronous machines equipped with static <b>excitation</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems have a fully controlled thyristor bridge that supplies DC current to the rotor winding. The rectifier bridge is fed by the stator terminals through a step-down transformer. The first control structure, named ""Direct Control"", has a single proportional-integral (PI) regulator that compares stator voltage setpoint with measured voltage and acts directly on the thyristor bridge`s firing angle. This control structure is usually employed in commercial <b>excitation</b> <b>systems</b> for hydrogenerators. The second structure, named ""Cascade Control"", was inspired on control loops of commercial DC motor drives. Such drives employ two PIs in a cascade arrangement, the external PI deals with the motor speed while the internal one regulates the armature current.
