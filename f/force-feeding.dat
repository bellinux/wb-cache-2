5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag {{is used as}} {{a symbol}} of the {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by <b>force-feeding</b> on 16 January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst {{was spared}} further <b>force-feeding</b> {{attempts}} after this incident, but {{she continued to}} violate the law and – when imprisoned – starve herself in protest. During the following two years she was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health. Later, the Asquith government enacted the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed similar releases for other suffragettes facing ill-health due to hunger strikes. Prison officials recognised the potential public relations disaster that would erupt if the popular WSPU leader were force-fed or allowed to suffer extensively in jail. Still, police officers arrested her during talks and as she marched. She tried to evade police harassment by wearing disguises and eventually the WSPU established a jujutsu-trained female bodyguard squad to physically protect her against the police. She and other escorts were targeted by police, resulting in violent scuffles as officers tried to detain Pankhurst.|$|E
25|$|Gavage-based {{foie gras}} {{production}} is controversial, due {{mainly to the}} animal welfare concerns about <b>force-feeding,</b> intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against <b>force-feeding,</b> and the production, import or sale of foie gras; even where it is legal, a number of retailers decline to stock it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Force-feed</b> hoppers use an {{impeller}} to capture paintballs and force {{them into the}} marker. The impeller is either spring-loaded or powered by a belt system, allowing it to maintain constant pressure on the stack of paintballs in the feed tube. This allows <b>force-feed</b> hoppers to feed paintballs at a rate exceeding 50 balls per second, since the mechanism does not rely on gravity. <b>Force-feed</b> hoppers are the dominant type used in tournaments, being the only type of loader capable of maintaining {{the high rate of}} fire of electropneumatic markers.|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} <b>force-feeding</b> can make animals sick by {{stressing}} the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption {{of which has}} been found to induce amyloidosis in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the effect}} of {{securities}} fraud {{is not enough to}} cause bankruptcy, a lesser level can wipe out holders of common stock because of the leverage of value of shares upon the difference between assets and liabilities.

25|$|The {{production}} of foie gras (the liver of a duck or a goose {{that has been}} specially fattened) involves the controversial <b>force-feeding</b> of birds with more food than they would eat in the wild, and more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.
