40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{wearable}} devices is imposed by the ability to monitor in real-time critical situations in the different areas of daily life. In many cases, power is the limiting factor for such devices. One aspect is the power supply with batteries that introduces issues due to the weight, the overall dimensions, and the disposal of the batteries. A viable solution to overcome the limitations of batteries as power source is to harvest ambient energy to power the devices directly. In this paper, a proposed wearable device with an energy harvesting module has been designed, manufactured, and tested for the measurement of vital signs. The energy-harvesting module is implemented to directly power the electronic circuit board by a <b>flexible</b> <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> This paper describes the proposed instrumented autonomous T-shirt powered by the <b>flexible</b> <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> applied directly on the T-shirt. The instrumented T-shirt is capable of measuring respiration rate, heart rate, and movement of the body.

40|$|Textile and {{semiconductor}} processes {{were combined}} {{to produce a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> by depositing silicon thin film onto woven polyester. Semiconductor processes such as evaporation, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) and RFsputtering were done under vacuum conditions. Microwave PECVD proved difficult for textile substrates as the weave was damaged using parameter settings commonly used for conventional substrates such as silicon wafers and glass. PECVD parameters such as temperature, gas flow-rate, mixture, pressure and power were adjusted to allow the textile to be processed and a good quality silicon thin film to be deposited. An extra conductive layer was introduced between the textile and metal back-contact to support the cell. The silicon film structure changed from amorphous to mixed crystal growth in an amorphous matrix, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy and light transmission. The silicon Raman spectrum often had three peaks with the middle one, a fingerprint for nanocrystal growth with a hexagonal wurtzite structure in between the amorphous and crystalline peaks. Process conditions for pure amorphous and microcrystalline structures were also established, requiring two peaks to fit the Raman spectrum. Different structures have different band-gap energies and these were determined by measuring the variation in light transmission. An amorphous structure has a band-gap energy of 1. 8 eV while a crystalline silicon structure has a band-gap of 1 eV and a mixed nanocrystalline content has an intermediate value which depends on the crystal size. A microcrystalline structure has a band-gap of 1. 6 eV...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effect of <b>flexible</b> <b>solar</b> <b>panels,</b> mounted on top of a greenhouse for electricity production, on yield and fruit quality of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersycum L., cv Daniela). This study was undertaken in a commercial raspa y amagado greenhouse, typical of the Almería region (Spain). Tomato plantlets were planted at a density of 0. 75 plants m- 2. The <b>flexible</b> <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> were mounted on two parts of the roof in different arrangements (T 1 and T 2), each blacking out 9. 8 % of its surface area.

No difference was found in terms of total or marketable production under these three arrangements, although fruit mean mass and maximum diameter of T 0 were significantly greater than T 1 and T 2. Fruit in T 0 matured earlier with more intense color compared with those in T 1 and T 2. However, these differences had no effect on price as the tomatoes produced under three conditions fell into the same commercial class (G class; diameter 67 - 81 mm). Solar panels covering 9. 8 % roof area of the greenhouse did not affect yield and price of tomatoes despite of their negative effect on fruit size and color...|$|E

This paper describes the results from an experimental investigation of elastic-plastic deformation behavior of nano/micro thick conducting metal such as gold (Au) on a highly compliant, biocompatible polymer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Two layer laminates were fabricated with various nano Au film on micron scale PDMS substrate and tested using a micro-tensile tester. Also, in-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests captured the digital images of Au film under static load to explain the changes in grain structure of the gold film. Stress-strain data for the gold film under large deformation was extracted using a mechanics of material based model, and changes in stiffness values of the Au film were determined. The experimental results validated the Hall-Petch law indicating that the material strength properties have inverse relationship with grain size. Results indicated that the metallic Au films sustained large deformation without rupture and SEM studies indicated that at higher strain levels, grains in the Au film experienced intra-granular fractures...|$|R
