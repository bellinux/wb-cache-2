50|$|The Steinhaus longimeter, {{patented}} by the professor Hugo Steinhaus, is an instrument {{used to measure}} the lengths of curves on maps. It is a transparent sheet of three grids, turned against each other by 30 degrees, each consisting of perpendicular lines spaced at equal distances 3.82 mm. The measurement is done by counting crossings of the curve with <b>grid</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>number</b> of crossings is the approximate length of the curve in millimetres.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} predict the ground {{movement}} using the GIS functions, the following data, such as calculation points, extraction panels and subsidence parameters should be prepared at first. Meanwhile, the input parameters for ground movement calculations could be separated into two categories. The first one is the generation of surface grid points for providing calculation points, including the distance of each grid point in the x and y directions, in which the number of points along the <b>grid</b> <b>lines,</b> the <b>number</b> of <b>grid</b> <b>lines,</b> point intervals along the <b>grid</b> <b>lines,</b> and the grid-line directions need to be established. The second one is entering the calculation data of ground movement, including the extraction panel sequence ID, seam upward angle, inclination of dip, subsidence factor, excavation thickness, horizontal-movement factor, angle of draw and time factor. Since the ground movement is calculated only with the above entering data, the calculation results of each panel would be uncertain once the input data are uncertain.|$|R

50|$|One {{drawback}} of a fixed {{radiographic grid}} {{is that it}} creates <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> on the image. Hollis Potter (1880-1964) showed in 1920 that the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> could be eliminated by moving the grid {{at right angles to}} the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> during the exposure. If the range and speed of motion is sufficient, the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> will be blurred out. The motion may be oscillating, vibrating, or reciprocating and must be continuous and smooth. The motion must also begin before exposure and continue until after exposure.|$|R

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} extract {{numerical}} {{data from a}} two dimensional graph. The motivation is to obtain soil density information from well logs, where the original numerical data is unavailable. The {{first step is to}} locate the <b>grid</b> <b>lines.</b> This may be achieved by a Hough transform of the image containing the graph. In the Hough transform, the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> appear as a regular pattern of peaks, with each peak corresponding to a <b>grid</b> <b>line.</b> The parameters of each <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> are obtained, enabling the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> to be removed from the image. The image now contains only the graph line, which may be scanned to extract the data values. The resultant data is processed to eliminate noise and to interpolate between breaks in the graph. Finally the coordinates are transformed from pixel units to the graph units, using the grid information extracted previously. This procedure also corrects for axis rotation in the captured image frame. With optimisation this method allows for fast and simple extraction of data, usable under a large range of applications...|$|R

Except for minor differences, the design {{is essentially the same}} for Universal Transverse Mercator grids, Universal Polar Stereographic grids, and nonstandard grids. The maps usually show <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> and ticks, their values, grid letters, and notes in the margin identifying the grid and the grid zone designation. Variations in the specifications for particular types of products at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale exist. The individual product specifications must be followed. A typical treatment is shown in figure 34. 8 - 2 THE MAJOR GRID. 8 - 2. 1 The major grid is shown by full lines at 100, 000 -unit intervals, intersected by ticks at 10, 000 -unit intervals.

40|$|Enhancing depth {{perception}} {{accuracy in}} virtual environments {{is an important}} and ongoing area of study. This thesis examines {{the effectiveness of a}} variety of depth cues and graphics techniques on depth perception accuracy in minimized 3 D virtual environments for effective disaster response. ^ For these studies, an application was developed that selectively applies various graphical techniques onto 3 D terrain maps. Two experimental studies were conducted using a CAVE system with one wall to study the influence of depth cues and the proposed techniques on depth perception. These experiments revealed which techniques are most effective for improving perception in these minified 3 D environments. ^ The preliminary study determined what types of techniques might be useful in disaster response environments. Based upon these results, <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> techniques were further developed to enhance perception in these scenes. Several variations of <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> techniques were developed, varying in convergence, style, and location in the virtual environment. The final experiment examined the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Two techniques that improved depth perception accuracy include <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> draped on top of the terrain and inverted <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> floating above the terrain and converging behind the user. In particular, the draped <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> technique appeared to be effective; the draped <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> technique was liked by the participants in their post-experimental surveys. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the use of integrated radial-basis-function networks (IRBFNs) for the discretisation of the velocity-pressure formulation in two dimensions on Cartesian grids. In the approximation of the ﬁeld variables (i. e. velocity components and pressure), instead of using low-order polynomial interpolants, we employ global IRBFNs along <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> (i. e. one-dimensional IRBFNs). In the imposition of boundary condition for the pressure, we propose two treatments, namely Treatment A and Treatment B. For both treatments, Neumann boundary conditions are transformed into Dirichlet ones. The former is based on values of the pressure at interior nodes along a <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> and ﬁrst derivative values of the pressure at two extreme nodes of that grid line; while the latter relies on values of the pressure at interior nodes along a <b>grid</b> <b>line</b> together with both ﬁrst and second derivative values of the pressure at two extreme nodes of that <b>grid</b> <b>line.</b> The proposed method is veriﬁed successfully through the simulation of a benchmark test, namely the isothermal lid-driven cavity ﬂow problem. ...|$|R
