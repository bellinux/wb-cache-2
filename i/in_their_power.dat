5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve.

5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest {{in the vicinity of}} a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E

[22] Of these rapidly-sketch'd hiatuses, the two {{which seem}} to me most serious are, for one, the condition, absence, or perhaps the {{singular}} abeyance, of moral conscientious fibre all through American society; and, for another, the appaling depletion of women <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> of sane athletic maternity, their crowning attribute, and ever making the woman, in loftiest spheres, superior to the man.|$|R
5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised to do everything <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to achieve {{the release of the}} hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} neighbour Mercia was, {{under the}} rule of kings Æthelbald, Offa and Coenwulf, the dominant kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. Offa, the greatest of the three, ruled Mercia until 796, followed soon after by Coenwulf. Offa's dominance was secured in part by marriage alliances with the other major kingdoms: Beorhtric of Wessex and Æthelred of Northumbria were married to his daughters. Further afield, Charlemagne, the pre-eminent ruler in the Christian West, appears to have taken an active interest in Northumbrian affairs. Charlemagne initially ruled Francia and parts of Italy, but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain. He was a staunch defender of the Papacy, and in the popes and the church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to Northumbria and beyond. Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> was enormous, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|The conversion, said Belhaven, {{would enable}} James Francis Edward's {{accession}} to the English throne upon William III's death. The Queen-Regent was not swayed by Belhaven's argument, so a compromise was reached: James Francis Edward, if he became King, {{would limit the}} number of Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England. In exchange, the confederate Lords would do all <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>power</b> to block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament. When, in March 1702, William III died, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness. Soon after, Lovat travelled to the court-in-exile at Saint-Germain, and begged the Queen-Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland. Lovat intended to raise an army of 15,000 soldiers in Scotland, to seize the throne for James Francis Edward. Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward, and the rising failed. Mary's regency ceased with her son's reaching of the age of 16.|$|E

25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility.

25|$|All {{nations in}} the Darkness series are monarchies with the {{exception}} of Kuusamo, in which seven princes have a hereditary power-sharing arrangement. While by no means all absolute monarchies, in all of them kings (or princes in Kuusamo) seem to have the executive power.

None of the people have family names, even if they are members of the nobility.
