5|$|Unlike other {{agricultural}} {{projects in}} French West Africa, the French Sudan irrigation project initially relied on families voluntarily resettling along lines {{established by the}} colonial authority. Unable to attract enough volunteers, the colonial authorities began to try forced resettlement to the cotton project. The Office du Niger was founded in 1926 as the main organization facilitating planned, irrigated agricultural projects. Farmers resisted forced resettlement and petitioned for permanent land rights to the <b>irrigated</b> <b>land</b> (which was usually held as property of the Office du Niger). Despite these efforts, a significant cash crop economy did not develop in the French Sudan.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, {{the common}} {{starling}} {{was introduced in}} 1897 by Cecil Rhodes. It spread slowly and by 1954 had reached Clanwilliam and Port Elizabeth. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It {{is present in the}} Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State provinces of South Africa and lowland Lesotho, with occasional sightings in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and around the town of Oranjemund in Namibia. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is very much associated with man, his habitations and pastures. It favours <b>irrigated</b> <b>land</b> and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in reedbeds. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in <b>irrigated</b> <b>land,</b> growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} several decades, remote sensing has emerged as an {{effective}} tool to monitor <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. The objective of this review, which summarizes the methods {{and the results of}} existing remote sensing studies, is to synthesize principle findings and assess the state of the art. We take a taxonomic approach to group studies based on location, scale, inputs, and methods, in an effort to categorize different approaches within a logical framework. We seek to evaluate the ability of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely coverage of <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> in several spectral regions. We also investigate the value of archived data that enable comparison of images through time. This overview of the studies to date indicates that remote sensing-based monitoring of irrigation is at an intermediate stage of development at local scales. For instance, there is overwhelming consensus on the efficacy of vegetation indices in identifying irrigated fields. Also, single date imagery, acquired at peak growing season, may suffice to identify <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands,</b> although to multi-date image data are necessary for improved classification and to distinguish different crop types. At local scales, the mapping of <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> with remote sensing is also strongly affected by th...|$|R
40|$|Warming {{temperatures}} cause temporal {{changes in}} growing seasons and prey abundance that drive earlier breeding by birds, especially dietary specialists within homogeneous habitat. Less {{is known about}} how generalists respond to climate-associated shifts in growing seasons or prey phenology, which may occur at different rates across land cover types. We studied whether breeding phenology of a generalist predator, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), was associated with shifts in growing seasons and, presumably, prey abundance, in a mosaic of non-irrigated shrub/grasslands and irrigated crops/pastures. We {{examined the relationship between}} remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and abundance of small mammals that, with insects, constitute approximately 93 % of kestrel diet biomass. We used NDVI to estimate the start of the growing season (SoGS) in <b>irrigated</b> and non-irrigated <b>lands</b> from 1992 to 2015 and tested whether either estimate of annual SoGS predicted the timing of kestrel nesting. Finally, we examined relationships among irrigated SoGS, weather and crop planting. NDVI was a useful proxy for kestrel prey because it predicted small mammal abundance and past studies showed that NDVI predicts insect abundance. NDVI-estimated SoGS advanced significantly in <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> (β = − 1 · 09 ± 0 · 30 SE) but not in non-irrigated lands (β = − 0 · 57 ± 0 · 53). Average date of kestrel nesting advanced 15 days in the past 24 years and was positively associated with the SoGS in <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands,</b> but not the SoGS in non-irrigated lands. Advanced SoGS in <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> was related to earlier planting of crops after relatively warm winters, which were more common in recent years. Despite different patterns of SoGS change between land cover types, kestrel nesting phenology shifted with earlier prey availability in <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands.</b> Kestrels may preferentially track prey in <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands</b> over non-irrigated lands because of higher quality prey on <b>irrigated</b> <b>lands,</b> or earlier prey abundance may release former constraints on other selective pressures to breed early, such as seasonal declines in fecundity or competition for high-quality mates. This {{is one of the first}} examples of an association between human adaptation to climate change and shifts in breeding phenology of wildlife...|$|R
