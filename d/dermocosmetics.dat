40|$|Conventional acne {{treatment}} presents several challenges such as intolerable {{side effects}} and antibiotic resistance. Dermocosmetic products {{may be used to}} reduce these unwanted effects. <b>Dermocosmetics</b> include skin cleansers, topical sebum-controllers, skin antimicrobial/anti-inflammatory agents, moisturizers, sunscreens, and camouflage products. Appropriate use of these products may help augment the benefit of acne treatment, minimize side effects, and reduce the need for topical antibiotics. In Asia, there is currently limited scientific data on the application and recommendations for dermocosmetic use in acne vulgaris (AV). This article reviews the evidence on <b>dermocosmetics</b> for AV and provides practice recommendations as discussed during the 4 th Asia-Pacific Acne Leaders' Summit held in Bangkok, Thailand, on 7 and 8 February 2015.

40|$|With the aim {{to develop}} {{effective}} and selective human tyrosinase inhibitors, we investigated aurone derivatives whose B-ring {{was replaced by}} a non-oxidizable 2 -hydroxypyridine-N-oxide (HOPNO) moiety. These aurones were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of purified human tyrosinase. Excellent inhibition activity was revealed and rationalized by theoretical calculations. The aurone backbone was especially found to play a crucial role, as the HOPNO moiety alone provided very modest activity on human tyrosinase. Furthermore, the in vitro activity was confirmed by measuring the melanogenesis suppression ability of the compounds in melanoma cell lysates and whole cells. Our study reveals that HOPNO-embedded 6 -hydroxyaurone is to date the most effective inhibitor of isolated human tyrosinase. Owing to its low toxicity and its high inhibition activity, it could represent a milestone on the path toward new valuable agents in <b>dermocosmetics,</b> as well as in medical fields where it was recently suggested that tyrosinase could play key roles...|$|E
30|$|Distinctive {{properties}} of melanin suggest wide environmental and medical applications. Fungal melanin has gained more interest for their potential in many fields of biomedicine, <b>dermocosmetics,</b> nanotechnology, and materials science. Radiation {{was used in}} medical treatment like radio-immunotherapy or therapy by external beam that can effect on bone marrow and this was considered as a harmful side effect for using radiation; many experiments estimate that melanin was successfully used to protect bone marrow from such side effect (Schweitzer et al. 2010). In cosmetic industry, melanin gained great interests due to its ability to protect skin against the serious effects of UV radiation (Solano 2014). Some microorganisms can exhibit a common strategy in response to UV radiation including the synthesis and accumulation of UV light absorbing secondary metabolites that act as sunscreens (Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz 1991; Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz 1993); melanin {{was known as the}} best secondary metabolites that act as sunscreens Kollias et al. 1991). Microbial melanin pigment, especially from marine species, is an attractive option for researchers and industries because it is safer, easily degradable, and eco-friendly and does not cause harmful effects (Pombeiro-Sponchiado et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ocean {{dominates the}} surface of our planet and {{plays a major role}} in {{regulating}} the biosphere. For example, the microscopic photosynthetic organisms living within provide 50 % of the oxygen we breathe, and much of our food and mineral resources are extracted from the ocean. In a time of ecological crisis and major changes in our society, it is essential to turn our attention towards the sea to find additional solutions for a sustainable future. Remarkably, while we are overexploiting many marine resources, particularly the fisheries, the planktonic compartment composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, represents 95 % of marine biomass and yet the extent of its diversity remains largely unknown and underexploited. Consequently, the potential of plankton as a bioresource for humanity is largely untapped. Due to their diverse evolutionary backgrounds, planktonic organisms offer immense opportunities: new resources for medicine, cosmetics and food, renewable energy, and long-term solutions to mitigate climate change. Research programs aiming to exploit culture collections of marine micro-organisms as well as to prospect the huge resources of marine planktonic biodiversity in the oceans are now underway, and several bioactive extracts and purified compounds have already been identified. This review will survey and assess the current state-of-the-art and will propose methodologies to better exploit the potential of marine plankton for drug discovery and for <b>dermocosmetics...</b>|$|E
40|$|Portugal {{is one of}} {{the richest}} European {{countries}} in thermal waters, and the majority of the spas are located inland in the northern and central regions. Thermal spa treatment is a touristic product that is highly recognized for its potential in the exploration of endogenous regional resources. Consequently, the development of new and competitive thermal tourism products can {{play an important role in}} the development of the inland regions, contributing effectively to addressing the economic asymmetries of the region. Based on their physico-chemical properties, thermal waters can have different therapeutic indications, including in dermatology. In the region of the Beira Interior there are two spas with thermal water presenting therapeutic dermatological applications, and the use of these waters in dermocosmetic formulations is proposed as one of the most relevant applications of innovation tools in the Thermal Spa sector. A number of cosmetic companies have encapsulated active molecules in nanoscale systems to enhance product performance. The properties of the nanocarriers systems, namely liposomes, polymeric and solid lipid nanoparticles as well nanoemulsions, are fundamental to increase the skin permeation/penetration. Furthermore, these systems have the capacity to preserve the original and unique properties of the thermal water and ensure the stability of the other active components during more time. The development of <b>dermocosmetics</b> based on thermal water carried in nanobiotechnological systems is proposed for its contribution to the differentiation amongst local, unique and genuine products, especially relevant in the case of products with high economic impact in tourism markets...|$|E
40|$|As a {{contribution}} for {{the generation of}} libraries in which a natural product (NP) is used as the guiding structure, this work sought to investigate molecular features of triterpenes as deliver leads to cross the stratum corneum at a significant rate. Seeking a bioguided investigation of the dermocosmetic lead-like potential of triterpenes in Prunus lusitanica L., various extracts were obtained by two different methods (Soxhlet extractor and Accelerated Solvent Extraction-ASE) and analyzed by GC–MS and NMR. In vitro assays were conducted to quantify the friedelin 1 and crude plant extract permeation through a membrane of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), {{as well as their}} skin penetration enhancement capacity using two model molecules, caffeine 19 and ibuprofen 20. Friedelin 1 was identified as the major component (16 – 77 %, GC) with isolated yield of 51 % w/w (94 %, GC) from Soxhlet residue (1. 7 % p/p) of the dried aerial parts of the plant harvested when in early flowering stage. Friedelin 1 promoted the penetration of the lipophilic molecule 20, however, it did not influence the permeation of the hydrophilic permeant 20. On the other hand, the crude extract acted as a retardant of the penetration of both substances. Molecular characteristics for the applicability of P. lusitanica L. in the development of <b>dermocosmetics,</b> as well as a new potential use for friedelin 1 in particular, are demonstrated. Probable mechanisms for chemical penetration enhancement using triterpenes as models for transdermal administration are herein discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic {{skin disease}} {{that shows a}} {{characteristic}} clinical picture. Skin lesions occur primarily in the seborrheic areas of the body, i. e., the face, back, and chest. Mandelic acid yields very good results when used to treat excessive actinic keratosis (keratosis actinica), hyperpigmentation (lentigo solaris and melasma), and meshlike wrinkles, which are primarily caused by sun-induced aging of the skin. This therapy is well suited {{for the care of}} skin with acne vulgaris. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of dermo-cosmetics containing 5 % or 10 % mandelic acid for the skin care of patients with acne vulgaris. Material and methods. An open study was carried out on 60 patients with papulo-pustular acne, who applied <b>dermocosmetics</b> to their skin for 2 months. Patients were divided into two subgroups of 30 patients each. One group was tested with a 5 % mandelic acid containing cosmetic while the other group was tested with a 10 % mandelic acid containing cosmetic. After the treatment was completed, acne severity was evaluated according to the Hellgren-Vincent scale. Results. Physical examinations performed during the study revealed a gradual improvement in the condition of the skin in both groups, with a {{reduction in the number of}} pustules, inflammatory nodules, and comedones. The proportion of patients in each group showing a reduction in disease severity according to the Hellgren-Vincent scale was similar. Conclusions. The results of the present study show that products containing 5 % or 10 % mandelic acid are both safe and effective for the treatment of acne...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} new hybrid hydrogels were {{prepared}} by radical copolymerization of 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, itaconic acid, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and silver particles. FTIR spectroscopy has confirmed binding of silver particels in hydrogels. Swelling studies performed in in vitro conditions showed dependence on PVP content and temperature. It {{can be seen}} that the antimicrobial activity of the Ag/P(HEMA/IA) PVP hybrid hydrogels depends on the PVP moiety and with the increase of PVP content the microbial contamination is more efficiently reduced. The best sensitivity was obtained for the polymers tested for antimicrobial activity against the yeast C. albicans, one of the most commonly encountered human pathogens, causing a wide variety of infections ranging from mucosal infections in generally healthy persons to life-threatening systemic infections in individuals with impaired immunity. A slightly less susceptible to antimicrobial effect of hydrogels was obtained for the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, where the reduction of cells was about 70 % after two hours of exposure, for the sample with the highest PVP content. The least susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of hydrogels examined was the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli, where the percent of cell reduction was below 20 %. Bearing in mind the influence of the time of exposure of microbes to the Ag/P(HEMA/IA) /PVP hybrid hydrogels, it was observed that the reduction of the number of cells depends on time, microbial culture and type of hybrid hydrogel sample. Due to their swelling and antimicrobial properties, silver/poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate/itaconic acid) /poly(vinylpyrrolidone) hybrid hydrogles show potential to use in the field of biomedicine, especially for treatment of skin and burns in <b>dermocosmetics...</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, several methods have been {{proposed}} in order to study and to evaluate characteristic properties of the human skin by using non-invasive approaches. Mostly, these methods cover aspects related to either dermatology, to analyze skin physiology and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of medical treatments in skin diseases, or <b>dermocosmetics</b> and cosmetic science to evaluate, for example, the effectiveness of anti-aging treatments. To these purposes a routine approach must be followed. Although very accurate and high resolution measurements can be achieved by using conventional methods, such as optical or mechanical profilometry for example, their use is quite limited primarily to the high cost of the instrumentation required, which in turn is usually cumbersome, highlighting some of the limitations for a routine based analysis. This thesis aims to investigate the feasibility of a noninvasive skin characterization system based on the analysis of capacitive images of the skin surface. The system relies on a CMOS portable capacitive device which gives 50 micron/pixel resolution capacitance map of the skin micro-relief. In order to extract characteristic features of the skin topography, image analysis techniques, such as watershed segmentation and wavelet analysis, have been used to detect the main structures of interest: wrinkles and plateau of the typical micro-relief pattern. In order to validate the method, the features extracted from a dataset of skin capacitive images acquired during dermatological examinations of a healthy group of volunteers have been compared with the age of the subjects involved, showing good correlation with the skin ageing effect. Detailed analysis of the output of the capacitive sensor compared with optical profilometry of silicone replica of the same skin area has revealed potentiality and some limitations of this technology. Also, applications to follow-up studies, as needed to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in a routine manner, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sophie Seité, 1 Clarice Caixeta, 2 Loan Towersey 3 1 La Roche-Posay Dermatological Laboratories, Asnières, France; 2 La Roche-Posay Dermatological Laboratories, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; 3 AIDS Division, Hospital Municipal Carlos Tortelly, Niterói, RJ, Brazil Background: Acne is {{a chronic}} {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit that mainly affects adolescents. It {{is the most common}} {{dermatological}} problem, affecting approximately 80 % of teenagers between 12 and 18 years of age. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on the patient&# 39;s age at the time the lesions first appear, and on its polymorphism, type of lesions, and their anatomical location. The right treatment for the right patient is key to treating acne safely. The aim of this investigational survey was to evaluate how Brazilian dermatologists in private practice currently manage acne. Materials and methods: Dermatologists practicing in 12 states of Brazil were asked how they manage patients with grades I, II, III, and IV acne. Each dermatologist completed a written questionnaire about patient characteristics, acne severity, and the therapy they usually prescribe for each situation. Results: In total, 596 dermatologists were interviewed. Adolescents presented as the most common acneic population received by dermatologists, and the most common acne grade was grade II. The doctors could choose more than one type of treatment for each patient, and treatment choices varied according to acne severity. A great majority of dermatologists considered treatment with drugs as the first alternative for all acne grades, choosing either topical or oral presentation depending on the pathology severity. <b>Dermocosmetics</b> were chosen mostly as adjunctive therapy, and their inclusion in the treatment regimen decreased as acne grades increased. Conclusion: This survey illustrates that Brazilian dermatologists employ complex treatment regimens to manage acne, choosing systemic drugs, particularly isotretinoin, even in some cases of grade I acne, and heavily prescribe antibiotics. Because complex regimens are harder for patients to comply with, this result notably raises the question of adherence, which is a key factor in successful treatment.
