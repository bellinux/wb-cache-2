5|$|Battersea council {{agreed to}} provide space for the statue on its Latchmere Recreation Ground, part of the council's new Latchmere Estate, which offered terraced homes to rent for seven and sixpence a week. The statue was {{unveiled}} on 15 September 1906 in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> crowd, with speakers that included George Bernard Shaw and the Irish feminist Charlotte Despard.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> disapproving crowd.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Serevi was {{selected}} for the Fiji B team, and the following year he {{was selected}} for Fiji, playing against Wellington in New Zealand. The Wellington game was his first in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> crowd, and he had mixed feelings about making his debut {{in front of a}} huge crowd. The next year he made his Test debut against Belgium in Liege.|$|E

5|$|The music video, like {{previous}} X Factor winners singles, is very simple, with Jackson {{singing the}} song in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> projection, with swooping shots of various landscapes behind him. It also features several clips from his time in The X Factor, from his first audition to the moment he was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and runner-up Rhydian Roberts all feature within the clips.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} follows no storyline. Each group member wears three {{different}} outfits throughout, {{all of which}} portray their individual styles. The video is introduced with a screen split into four in which each member is shown singing to the camera. They then dance separately in front of different, brightly-coloured backdrops which manifest their individual personalities: a flower and gramophone record backdrop (Edwards), a bow tie backdrop (Thirlwall), graffiti-decorated (Pinnock), and boomboxes (Nelson). Near {{the end of the}} video, the group are accompanied by male backing dancers for a hip hop and chair-dance dance routine in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> Union Jack.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé then {{sings the}} chorus again and dances in her red dress {{in front of}} the background. Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing the chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E

5|$|In New Zealand, Malone's {{death was}} widely {{reported}} and keenly felt, {{particularly in the}} Taranaki region. The soldiers of the Wellington Regiment held their former commander in high regard and paid {{for the construction of}} the Malone Memorial Gate, white marble gates at the entrance to King Edward Park in Stratford. The gate, one of New Zealand's largest war memorials that commemorates an individual soldier, was officially opened on 8 August 1923 in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> crowd. The gate is the scene of an annual ceremony held on 8 August to commemorate the memory of Malone. A fictionalised colonel based on Malone was a major character in a 1982 play written by Maurice Shadbolt, Once on Chunuk Bair, which told the story of the Wellington Battalion's battle of 8 August. In 1992, the play was filmed as Chunuk Bair. A plaque in his honour was unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament's Grand Hall in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

50|$|In Laos, lam may be {{performed}} standing (lam yuen) or sitting (lam nang). Northern lam is typically lam yuen and southern lam is typically lam nang. In Isan lam was traditionally performed seated, {{with a small}} audience surrounding the singer, but over {{the latter half of}} the 20th century the introduction of stages and amplification allowed a shift to standing performances in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> audience.|$|R
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

50|$|One large {{application}} for LPDAs is in rooftop terrestrial television antennas, since {{they must have}} large bandwidth to cover the wide television bands of roughly 54 - 88 and 174 - 216 MHz in the VHF and 470 - 890 MHz in the UHF while also having high gain for adequate fringe reception. One widely used design for television reception combined a Yagi for UHF reception in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> LPDA for VHF.|$|R
50|$|During the song's chorus, {{the band}} members perform their {{signature}} dance moves of this song, alongside other visitors who also joyously participate. The band is then assisted to stand up on a table, where they execute their Asereje dance in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> jubilant crowd who gleefully jive in to the dance. By {{the end of the}} video, the crowd becomes jam-packed and in multitudes, with the young and old dancing to the song near the beach bar.|$|R

However, the legend did not appear in print until 1948 and modern scholars doubt the veracity of this story.|$|E

25|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, the routes, now a residential road, cross a junction with Milestrip Road (CR460), the county-maintained continuation of NY179. Now known as Orchard Park Road, NY277 and NY240 continue north through Orchard Park before reaching a junction with US20 (Southwestern Boulevard) in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> strip mall. Just north of the junction with US20, NY240 and NY277 enter Harold Square and split at a fork, with NY240 running northwest along Orchard Park and NY277 running north on Union Road. NY277 soon crosses into the town of West Seneca and becomes a four-lane residential street.|$|E
25|$|Authorities in {{the witch}} trials {{routinely}} stripped an accused witch {{of clothing and}} shaved all body hair so that no potential mark could be hidden. Pins were driven into scars, calluses and thickened areas of skin: the practice of “pricking a witch”. Customarily, this routine was performed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> crowd. Medieval inquisitors also believed that the Devil left invisible marks upon his followers. If after stripping and shaving, the accused witch {{was found to have}} no likely blemishes, pins were simply driven into her body until an insensitive area was found. The search for witches' marks had disappeared by 1700.|$|E
25|$|Bodson found Msiri {{sitting in}} <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hut with 300 {{men in the}} background, many armed with muskets. Bodson told Msiri {{he had come to}} take him to Stairs, and Msiri did not reply but became angry, rose and put his hand on his sword (a gift brought by Stairs). Bodson drew his {{revolver}} and shot Msiri three times, and one of Msiri's men — his son Masuka — fired his musket hitting Bodson in the abdomen and spinal column. The Dahomeyan askari shot and killed Masuka, and in the general firing Hamadi was hit in the ankle.|$|E
50|$|The same decade, Romas {{conducted}} the kite experiment that Benjamin Franklin proposed in 1750 {{in a letter}} to Peter Collinson, but that had not yet reached France. Raising a wire-wrapped kite in a thunderstorm, Romas proved the electrical nature of lightning. During his experiment, he noticed ten feet long sparks and explosions. He also reported that during a repeat performance in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> audience, he received severe jolts that were more intense than all he received before during experiments with Leyden jars. For this reason, he performed later experiments only with separately grounded conductors and kites that he handled via glass rods.|$|R
