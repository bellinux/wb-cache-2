PharMEDium is voluntarily recalling all 50 ml. magnesium sulfate admixtures. These 50 ml preparations will not be available until further notice.

40|$|Abstract. As {{wearable}} computing {{becomes more}} mainstream, it holds {{the promise of}} delivering timely, relevant <b>notifications</b> <b>to</b> the user. How-ever, these devices can potentially inundate the user, distracting them at the wrong times and providing the wrong amount of information. As physiological sensing also becomes consumer-grade, it holds the promise of helping <b>to</b> control these <b>notifications.</b> <b>To</b> solve this, we build a system Phylter that uses physiological sensing <b>to</b> modulate <b>notifications</b> <b>to</b> the user. Phylter receives streaming data about a user’s cognitive state, and uses this to modulate whether the user should receive the information. We discuss {{the components of the}} system and how they interact...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{clinical}} {{benefits of}} remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac-implanted devices {{have not been}} fully evaluated in Japan. We investigated the clinical benefits of RM in a single center in Japan. Methods: Patients with pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillators (CRT-D) were assigned to RM and non-RM groups. The outpatient wait times and times <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> of EVENTS that we defined sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, worsening heart failure, and inappropriate therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in this study, were compared between the 2 groups. Results: A total of 416 patients (RM: 61; non-RM: 355) were evaluated. The outpatient wait time was 17. 6 ± 22. 1  min for the RM group and 35. 6 ± 25. 2  min for the non-RM group (P< 0. 001). Seventy-seven and 306 EVENTS were observed in 38 and 256 patients during mean follow-up periods of 360 ± 22 days and 429 ± 10 days in the RM and non-RM groups, respectively. The times <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> of EVENTS were 8. 1 ± 16. 2 days for the RM group and 38. 7 ± 33. 2 days for the non-RM group (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: RM significantly shortened outpatient wait times and times <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> of EVENTS. Therefore, RM was clinically beneficial in a single center in Japan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{turnaround}} time of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) test results may delay time <b>to</b> <b>notification</b> {{and treatment of}} test-positive patients and result in unnecessary antimicrobial use in test-negative patients. This quasi‐experimental study evaluated the impact of NG/CT rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) in an urban emergency department (ED) on treatment appropriateness, time <b>to</b> <b>notification,</b> and cost. Patients tested in December 2013 –January 2014 (traditional group, n= 200) were compared with those in December 2014 –January 2015 (RDT group, n= 200). There was {{a significant increase in}} treatment appropriateness in the RDT group, 72. 5 % versus 60 % (P= 0. 008) and time <b>to</b> results <b>notification</b> was significantly faster (median 17. 4 versus 51. 5 hours, P= 0. 010). Availability of test result prior to discharge was associated with increased treatment appropriateness (odds ratio, 22. 65 [95 % confidence interval, 2. 86 – 179. 68]). The RDT would save approximately $ 37, 000 annually. These results support the use of NG/CT RDT to expand antimicrobial stewardship efforts within the ED...|$|R
40|$|Records of {{notification}} {{in cases}} of eight infectious diseases in the "Servei Territorial de Salut Publica" of the Province of Barcelona, Spain, between 1982 and 1986 were reviewed. Time from onset of symptoms <b>to</b> <b>notification,</b> time from <b>notification</b> <b>to</b> completion of data collection, and time from onset to completion of the case investigation were analyzed. For the period from onset <b>to</b> <b>notification,</b> the shortest mean was registered for meningococcal infection (6. 31 days) and the longest was for pulmonary tuberculosis (54. 79 days). For time from <b>notification</b> <b>to</b> complete investigation, the shortest value was for pulmonary tuberculosis (12. 20 days) and the longest for rickettsioses (35. 79 days). Time from onset to completion of data collection was 22. 87 days for meningococcal infection and 72. 34 days for tuberculosis of other organs (probably because of the {{long period of time}} that elapses between the onset of the first symptoms and notification). It would appear that both physicians and the general population must be educated so that lay-men can identify early signs and symptoms of disease and physicians can realize that statutory notification of infectious diseases is strongly linked to community health care...|$|R
