[...] He has {{also said that the}} song could refer to Steinman and himself, with an array of {{emotions}} coming back every time they work together.

500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & <b>kiss</b> <b>you</b> at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't <b>kiss</b> <b>you,</b> so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E

Andy Kellman of Allmusic {{said that}} the song works a [...] "slow motion glide" [...] and that Ciara's voice [...] "hovers in a love-struck daze." [...] The lyrical content of the song consists of the protagonist confesses how perfect her significant other is, and that they need extra time to confess this, such as lines like [...] "I'd need an extra month on the year, one extra holiday just to <b>kiss</b> <b>you</b> all over your face." ...|$|E

500|$|... "No Better" [...] is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has {{a similar}} {{sonority}} {{to that of other}} songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's [...] "feathery" [...] vocals and minimal production. It incorporates [...] "woozy" [...] basslines, and [...] "pulsing" [...] synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody [...] "dreamy", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde [...] " [...] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change". At the first verse, she sings [...] "We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers / And your breath's hot and gross but I <b>kiss</b> <b>you</b> like a lover". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings [...] "Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all".|$|E
500|$|When Hilson {{talked to}} Digital Spy about the song, {{she said that}} Timbaland called her and said, [...] "I've got a song that I think's better than 'The Way I Are'. I think it's bigger." [...] They took the track and wrote [...] "Return the Favor" [...] over the beat. According to Hilson, she said that song was {{partially}} inspired by [...] "that conversational, back-and-forth thing" [...] they did on [...] "The Way I Are", stating, [...] "We got a great response from that {{that we wanted to}} do it again." [...] The initial draft of the hook featured the line [...] "If you kiss me then I’ll <b>kiss</b> <b>you</b> back", but according to Hilson in an interview with That Grape Juice, it was changed by unknown reason by Timbaland. After it was reported that In a Perfect World... would be pushed back to October 2008, [...] "Return the Favor" [...] surfaced online, and it was rumored to be the follow-up to [...] "Energy." [...] The sample was later removed by Hilson's management, before it was announced as the album's second single. The song was featured on December 15, 2008 episode of The Hills.|$|E
500|$|In many Buffy episodes, {{understanding}} why evil has appeared {{is important in}} knowing how to fight it, but the reasons for The Gentlemen's arrival and their need to take seven human hearts are never made explicit; they are simply there. According to Giles' overhead transparencies, they can appear in any town. Several Buffy scholars assert that a sexual element similar to what is presented in classic fairy tales is evident in [...] "Hush". Buffy often has prophetic dreams, {{and it is in}} a dream that she first sees one of The Gentlemen; she sees a flash of his face just as Riley touches her shoulder. Buffy has only been sexually intimate twice before: with the vampire Angel, whose lovemaking cost him his soul, and with the womanizing Parker Abrams. Riley is notably different from both and Buffy's anxiety about becoming intimate with him, according to scholars, either calls The Gentlemen to Sunnydale or is represented by them. The Gentlemen murder by cutting chests open and removing hearts, penetrative acts. In Buffy's dream Riley says, [...] "If I <b>kiss</b> <b>you,</b> it'll make the sun go down" [...] and when he does so, it instantly becomes night, as if Buffy has crossed over a threshold. Riley's kiss creates physical and emotional intimacy, but initiates mental, intuitive knowledge as well: in this episode Buffy learns of Riley's secret role as a member of The Initiative. Threshold imagery is again used when Tara and Willow block the door with their combined efforts, shutting The Gentlemen out.|$|E

500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I <b>kiss</b> <b>you</b> and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion".

[...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time".

Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
