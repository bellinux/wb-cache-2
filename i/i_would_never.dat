25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just how nice {{it would be if}} you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E

25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{have become a}} writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth.
