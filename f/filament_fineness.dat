40|$|This paper {{focused on}} the {{assessment}} of the relation between constructional properties and percentage reflectance values of fabrics woven from polyester yarns through fabric layer numbers. Reflectance measurements were conducted on pretreated but undyed fabric samples at five different fabric layers. Twelve polyester fabrics having different constructional parameters were used and fabrics differed from each other by their weft yarn densities, weave patterns, and weft yarn <b>filament</b> <b>fineness.</b> Warp yarn properties (type, count, and density) were the same at all the fabrics. Percentage reflectance values of the fabrics changed according to yarn density, weave pattern, and <b>filament</b> <b>fineness</b> in accordance with fabric layer numbers during reflectance measurement. Percentage reflectance values gradually increased as fabric layer numbers increased. The highest reflectance values were obtained at 16 layers of fabric. The effects of single constructional parameters on reflectance values disappeared as fabric layer numbers increased. Percentage reflectance values were analyzed according to ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and statistical results revealed the cross relations obtained. Light-trap phenomenon was discussed according to reflectance characteristics of woven fabrics...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of air-jet {{textured}} yarns {{are determined by}} the instability, linear density, and strength, together with structural properties such as loop size, loop frequency, and degree of entanglement. Such characteristics are affected by various process parameters and supply yarn properties. The effects of these parameters on the final yarn properties have been investigated using instability, linear density, and strength tests, together with SEM photographs for visual assessment of the yarn structure. Optimizing any given yarn property almost always affects other yarn characteristics, and therefore this must be remembered when selecting suitable process parameters and supply yarns for specific end uses. For a given texturing nozzle and conditions, there is an optimum <b>filament</b> <b>fineness</b> and number of filaments that can be textured effectively...|$|E
30|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to predict the physical, {{mechanical}} and comfort properties of woven, non-woven and knitted fabrics using various prediction tools. Most of the work is focused on modelling the fibre-yarn relationship, yarn tenacity, fault detection, compression, elastic properties and hand values of woven, nonwoven and knitted fabrics. Although some studies have discussed prediction of thermal properties i.e. thermal resistance, thermal conductivity of woven and knitted fabrics, none of the studies give a detailed review of the modelling of comfort properties particularly thermal absorptivity and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated knitted fabrics. Moreover, very few studies are devoted to the prediction of thermo-physiological properties: thermal properties, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate collectively. An attempt is therefore made to model the thermo-physiological properties of plated knitted fabrics from constructional parameters like back yarn linear density, <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> loop length and total yarn linear density using statistical and artificial neural network approach and comparison of the developed models in terms of their prediction performance and robustness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract––Mechanical crimp texturising {{technique}} is {{making use of}} differential migration behavior of the constituent filaments during their torsional deformation as well as bending deformation. Types of yarn, yarn fineness, <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> shape factor etc. are the detrimental factors for these extents of deformations. Fully drawn continuous filament yarns with contrasting colours, apart from variation {{in one or more}} contributing factors mentioned above were grouped together for the desired production of fancy yarns. Structure of fancy yarn was analyzed by microscopical examination. The colour analysis of the product yarn was also done on Hunter lab colour measurement instrument Spectra Span 9100. This has permitted in identifying apparent colour of fancy yarn scientifically, which is different than its parent yarn colour. Favorable transformation of cheaper and stronger flat filament feeder yarn structure to favourable crimpy/bulky yarn structure was an added gain of this production process. All the samples were also shown good crimp associated properties. Thus newly designed fancy yarn produced out of flat filament yarn found to be a good option for value addition along with added comfort to apparel textiles as well as home furnishing...|$|E
30|$|The {{predicted}} thermo-physiological {{properties of}} plated fabrics by ANN were {{in close agreement with}} target outputs (experimental values) which proves the robustness and generalization {{ability of the}} network. However, the mean absolute percentage error in the prediction of air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated fabrics were on slightly higher side. The input parameters selected for the network construction namely back layer yarn linear density, <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> loop length and total yarn linear density influence the fabrics bulk properties like thickness, fabric weight which are the determinants of thermal properties. The selected input parameters were found to be sufficient for prediction of thermal properties. However, air permeability depends on the openness of the fabric structure or the free inter yarn spaces in the fabric and hence fabric porosity. The exclusion of porosity as one of the input parameters might be the reason for high mean absolute percentage error in prediction of air permeability. Moisture vapour transmission rate through fabrics depend on free air spaces in the fabric for moisture diffusion and moisture diffusivity of the fibres. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the fibre can affect the moisture diffusion through textiles significantly. The inclusion of constituent fibres as one of the input parameter to neural network may result in lowering the error percentage in prediction of moisture vapour transmission rate.|$|E
30|$|Thermo-physiological {{properties}} of textiles {{play a very}} crucial role in providing thermal equilibrium to human beings in changing ambient conditions and activity level and in turn dictate the overall wearer comfort. A number of prediction tools like mechanistic, statistical and stochastic (artificial neural network) models are finding application in textiles for reasonable prediction of various aspects of textiles before the actual commencement of fabric production and testing. In this study, thermo-physiological {{properties of}} polyester–cotton plated fabrics were predicted by two approaches: artificial neural network and response surface equations. A multilayered back propagation artificial neural network was developed with four input nodes corresponding to four selected input parameters: back layer yarn linear density, <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> total yarn linear density and loop length and one output node corresponding to the predicted thermo-physiological property. Four individual networks working in tandem with common set of input parameters and each giving an individual output were developed such that the outputs of four networks were thermal resistance, thermal absorptivity, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate respectively. Network architecture gave good prediction performance with low values of mean absolute percentage error and high coefficient of determination. Response surface equations were developed to predict the thermo-physiological properties and good agreement between experimental and predicted values for all the properties was found with coefficient of determination over 0.9. Artificial neural network predicted the thermal resistance and air permeability of plated fabrics with good accuracy. However, the response surface equations served better prediction tool for thermal absorptivity and moisture vapour transmission rate prediction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:-Mechanical crimp texturising {{method was}} {{developed}} with {{the virtue of}} imparting economy and versatility to the texturising process. Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to flat multifilament yarn. Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different false twist levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; yarn fineness, <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done. All the samples irrespective of the material have shown the rise in the percent bulk, linear density, percent extension, percent boiling water shrinkage with finer trilobal cross section filament yarn. However, at identical yarn fineness, number of filaments (dpf) has played a detrimental role than modulus of polymeric yarn...|$|E
30|$|In the beginning, air-jet {{textured}} yarns were produced by blowing {{a stream of}} air into twisted continuous filament yarns, while they were being overfed to the take-up bobbin (Wray & Entwistle 1968). Studies in the 1960 s by Wray and Entwistle (1969) were followed those by Sivakumar (1975) in the early 1970 s. Since 1980 s, researchers have mainly focused on investigating the effect of process parameters, nozzle geometry, and the air-flow behaviour on yarn texturing. Researchers (Acar 1988; Acar et al. 1986 b; Rangasamy et al. 1990) have studied the effect of <b>filament</b> <b>fineness</b> {{and concluded that the}} filaments with finer linear densities are more suitable for air-jet texturing due to their less bending and torsional stiffness that blow the filaments more easily that enhance the entanglement effectiveness. Supply yarn properties are important for texturing since resultant forces acting on filaments are determined by the fluid forces acting on the filaments (Acar 1991; Acar et al. 1986 b). Further Acar et al. (1986 c) found that the filament cross section also has direct influence on texturing and concluded that the non-circular filament cross sections have better filament texturing due to larger surface areas than the circular filament of equal linear density. Spin finish on filaments has a negative effect on the texturing process due to contamination of the texturing nozzle (Simmen 1987). However, researchers (Acar 1988; Acar & Demir 1987) dispute the above explanation and argued that most of the spin finish blow off from the filament due to the secondary air-low and the new jets are self cleaned. They suggest using a suitable spin-finish for air-jet texturing which removes them in filament wetting that improves the filament flexibility. Feeder yarn wetting was studied by many researchers (Acar & Demir 1987; Acar et al. 1986 d; Acar et al. 1986 a; Demir et al. 1988; Fisher & Wilson 1982; Kothari & Timble 1991) and reported that the feeder yarn wetting before the air-jet nozzle influence the stability of the texturing process as well as the textured yarn properties. Recent studies by Acar et al. (2006) reported that water acted as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the air-jet texturing process. Study by Kothari et al. (1996) attempted to characterise the structure of air-jet {{textured yarns}} in terms of migration parameters. Since air-jet texturing process was developed to feed POY yarns, research were carried out by Sengupta et al. (1989) to understand the influence of drawing variables on the properties of air-jet textured yarns made from POY feeder yarns.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of fine filaments using the melt spinning process needs considerable effort. A thermoplastic melt is stretched from the spinneret under a constant take-up speed. The high performance thermoplastic PEEK is solidified in the melt spinning {{process in a}} small distance and short time. Therefore, the fine PEEK filaments in the fibre formation zone underwent a high deformation and cooling rate. To make the melt spinning process stable and to produce the fine PEEK filaments, material properties and material behaviour are examined using on-line and off-line measurements. The fibre speed measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry and simultaneous temperature measured using infrared thermography enable both the strain rate and consequently the apparent extensional viscosity to be estimated. This provides the apparent extensional viscosity over the spinning line, which can itself show the structural development of PEEK fibres in the fibre formation zone, i. e. necking and solidification phenomena. The one-dimensional fibre formation model must include both procedural and material parameters. The heat transfer coefficient was estimated using the filament temperature measurement and showed a relatively high contribution of radiation and free convection in comparison to forced convection near the spinneret. The improved model of PEEK fibre formation gave a good agreement to both temperature and speed measurements, and also confirmed the high deformation rate effect on the extensional viscosity, which could be simulated with a properly generalised Newtonian constitutive equation. The end properties of the fibres, such as as-spun <b>filament</b> <b>fineness,</b> orientation (expressed using total birefringence) and total crystallisation (examined using DSC) are investigated in relation to different spinning conditions, i. e. take-up speed, throughput and the draw down ratio. The tensile test diagram results, measuring phenomena such as the elongation at break, tenacity, and the Young modulus of elasticity are also analysed in order to complete the correlation of the above-mentioned spinning conditions to the structural properties of as-spun fine PEEK filaments. The melt spinning of fine PEEK fibres under different spinning conditions is examined {{with the purpose of}} finding the optimum take-up speed and throughputs. Other spinning conditions, such as the temperature of melt processing, and the arrangement and diameter of the spinneret holes, are changed {{in order to make the}} process more stable. The recommendations for further study can be used to further examine some aspects of this work; however, this work presents a new concept for fine PEEK melt spinning supported by spinnability examinations under different spinning conditions and the improved model of fibre formation, which is also relevant for typical industrial processing applications...|$|E
