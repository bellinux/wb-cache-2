40|$|A {{reasonably}} economical way {{was developed}} to determine availability characteristics of Deep Space Network (DSN) data systems, subsystems, and assemblies using the DSN <b>discrepancy</b> <b>report</b> (DR) data base and DSN operating schedule and history data bases. Operating {{mean time between failures}} (OMTBF), operating mean time to restore service (OMTTRS), and operating functional availability (OFA) can be computed by year, by system, by subsystem, by assembly, and by station. The effort required to produce the desired reports is described, specific data on the telemetry, command, and tracking systems are presented, and major contributors to system outages are identified.

The model provides a probability distribution for the duration of outages, which agrees well with observed data. The model depends only on a small number of parameters, and has some heuristic justification. This shows that the <b>Discrepancy</b> <b>Reporting</b> System in the Deep Space Network (DSN) can be used to estimate the probability of extended outages in spite of the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>reports</b> ending when the pass ends.

40|$|<b>Discrepancy</b> <b>Reporting</b> Management System (DRMS) is a {{computer}} program designed {{for use in the}} stations of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) to help establish the operational history of equipment items; acquire data on the quality of service provided to DSN customers; enable measurement of service performance; provide early insight into the need to improve processes, procedures, and interfaces; and enable the tracing of a data outage to a change in software or hardware. DRMS is a Web-based software system designed to include a distributed database and replication feature to achieve location-specific autonomy while maintaining a consistent high quality of data. DRMS incorporates commercial Web and database software. DRMS collects, processes, replicates, communicates, and manages information on spacecraft data discrepancies, equipment resets, and physical equipment status, and maintains an internal station log. All <b>discrepancy</b> <b>reports</b> (DRs), Master <b>discrepancy</b> <b>reports</b> (MDRs), and Reset data are replicated to a master server at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Master DR data are replicated to all the DSN sites; and Station Logs are internal to each of the DSN sites and are not replicated.

It is found that for a three year period, the availability of the telemetry data system is 99. 0 %, and its mean time to restore service is 0. 9 hours; the availability of the TWM assemblies is 99. 83 %, and their mean time to restore service is 2. 5 hours...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} devised to select those clinical chemistry results that have a high probability of error for inclusion on a <b>discrepancy</b> <b>report,</b> which is printed on demand throughout the day. Each report entry is evaluated by a supervisor, who decides whether to accept the result or to re-assay. With this program, 8. 4 % of all results were included on the report, 1. 9 % were re-assayed, and 0. 83 % were judged to be in error and corrected. Checking results {{at the time of}} their re-lease to the computer has led to earlier report delivery and more convenient timing of re-assays without com-promise of patient safety. AddItIonal Keyphrases: screening of data on patients After implementation of a laboratory computer system in the clinical chemistry section of our labora-tory, it became possible to enhance quality control by visual report checking. As the numerous separate re-ports formerly issued on a single patient had now been collated into three daily nursing-unit reports followed by a cumulative six-day summary report each evening, convenient formats were available for comparing results on patients, and discrepancies were found that would have previously escaped no-tice. However, there were several obvious drawbacks to the visual checking system. First, the amount of time required to check more than 2900 results daily led to a delay in report delivery. Second, discrepancies went unnoticed by even the most experienced, well-moti-vated observers. Third, most discrepancies were found after the afternoon report printout. As a con-sequence, the re-assays created a burden for evening personnel, and, in some instances, had to be deferred until the following day, with resulting danger to the patient and inconvenience to the attending staff...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to characterize the distribution and costs of spacecraft discrepancies found at the system level of integration and test, as well as understand the implications of those distributions and costs for the spacecraft enterprise as a whole. If discrepancies can be better understood, they can potentially be reduced or even eliminated. Reducing discrepancies will result in cycle time reduction and cost savings, as well as increased product quality and reliability. All of these potential outcomes are indications of successful progress toward becoming a lean organization. Data on discrepancies at the system level of integration were gathered from spacecraft vendor databases, while interviews with key program managers and engineers provided perspective and insight into the data. Results are based on 224 spacecraft representing at least 20 different programs or product lines, and encompassing 23, 124 discrepancies. The spacecraft date from 1973 - 1999, and represent different vendors as well as a mix of commercial and government spacecraft. Spacecraft discrepancies are analyzed in this work on the basis of ten categories: the spacecraft mission, the spacecraft subsystem where the discrepancy occurred, the date of the discrepancy occurrence, the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>report</b> open duration, the immediate action taken to fix the discrepancy (disposition), the root cause of the discrepancy, the long-term corrective action prescribed to prevent the discrepancy from happening again on future spacecraft, the labor time spent on the discrepancy, and the cycle time lost due to the discrepancy. Statistical measures of central tendency, correlation and normality are presented for each category. This statistical analysis forms the basis for research findings at the enterprise level in the areas of quality yield, resource utilization, stakeholder satisfaction and flow time. Recommendations to enterprise stakeholders for increasing the value derived from system-level integration and test follow from the enterprise-level findings. by Annalisa L. Weigel. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The Project Management and Engineering Branch (SF 4) {{supports}} the Human Health and Performance Directorate (HH&P) and {{is responsible for}} developing and supporting human systems hardware for the International Space Station (ISS). When a principal investigator's (PI) medical research project on the ISS is accepted, SF 4 develops the necessary hardware and software to transport to the ISS. The two projects I primarily worked on were the centrifuge and ultrasound projects. Centrifuge: One concern with spacecraft such as the ISS is electromagnetic interference (EMI) from onboard equipment, typically from radio waves (frequencies of ~ 3 kHz to ~ 300 GHz), which can negatively affect nearby circuitry. Standard commercial centrifuges produce EMI above safety limits, so my task was to help reduce EMI production from this equipment. Two centrifuges were tested: one unmodified as a control and one modified. To reduce EMI below safety limits, one centrifuge was modified to become a Faraday shield, in which significant electrical contact was made between all regions of the centrifuge housing. This included removing non-conductive paint, applying conductive fabric to the lid and foam sealer, adding a 10, 000 F decoupling capacitor across the power supply, and adding copper adhesive-mount gaskets to the housing interior. EMI testing of both centrifuges was performed in the EMI/EMC Control Test and Measurement Facility. EMI for both centrifuges was below safety limits for frequencies between 10 MHz and 15 GHz (pass); however, between 14 kHz and 10 MHz, EMI for the unmodified centrifuge exceeded safety limits (fail) as expected. Alternatively, for the modified centrifuge with the Faraday shield, EMI was below the safely limit of 55 dBV/m for electromagnetic frequencies between 14 kHz and 10 MHz. This result indicates our modifications were successful. The successful EMI test allowed us {{to communicate with the}} vendor what modifications they needed to make to their commercial unit to meet our specifications and to understand {{what needs to be done}} in lab to the new centrifuge. Our modifications will provide a standard for readying centrifuges for future missions. Once the new modified centrifuge arrives by the vendor, it will need to undergo EMI testing again for validation. The centrifuge is also in the process of compatibility testing with a custom stowage drawer, which is an ongoing project in SF 4. Both of these items will be payloads on future missions to the ISS for various research purposes. Ultrasound: ISS currently has an onboard ultrasound (Ultrasound 2 system) for research and medical purposes. Every piece of medical flight hardware has an equivalent ground-unit so instrumentation can be routinely evaluated and transported to the ISS if necessary. The ground-unit ultrasound equipment must be evaluated every six months using a task performance sheet (TPS). A TPS is a document, written by the appropriate scientists and engineers, which describes how to run equipment and is written in such a way that astronauts with unspecialized training can follow the tasks. I was responsible for performing six TPSs on a combination of three ultrasounds and two video power converters (VPCs). Performing a TPS involves checking out and computationally documenting each piece of equipment removed from storage locations, setting up hardware and software, performing tasks to verify functionality, returning equipment, and logging items back into the computerized system. My work revealed all ground-unit ultrasounds were functioning properly. Because of proper function, a <b>discrepancy</b> <b>report</b> (DR) did not have to be opened. The TPS was then passed along to the Quality Engineering (QE) for review and ultimately given to Quality Assurance (QA). Other projects: In addition to my main projects, I participated in other tasks including troubleshooting an EEG headband, volunteering for an ultrasound training research study, and conformal coating printed circuit boards. My internship at SF 4 has helped me understand how space systems hardware development for the ISS fits into NASA's mission and vision...|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of {{nucleic acid sequence}} data interpretation was determined by assessing and quantifying the <b>discrepancies</b> <b>reported</b> in the GenBank database. This permitted the calculation of an Error Rate (ER) for nucleic acid sequence determination. If one assumes that most entries (TB, Total Bases) were independently verified or those without <b>reported</b> <b>discrepancies</b> were correct, the ER is 0. 368 errors per 1000 bases.
