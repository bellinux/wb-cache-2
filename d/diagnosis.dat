5|$|A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often {{guided by}} {{endoscopic}} ultrasound, {{may be used}} where there is uncertainty over the <b>diagnosis,</b> but a histologic <b>diagnosis</b> is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive <b>diagnosis.</b> The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and <b>diagnosis</b> of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|A <b>diagnosis</b> of {{psoriasis}} {{is usually}} {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his <b>diagnosis,</b> {{letters of}} support from well-wishers poured into his California home.|$|E
5|$|DVT <b>diagnosis</b> {{requires}} {{the use of}} imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> {{includes}} {{determining the}} clinical signs {{and the medical}} history, with inquiry into possible routes of exposure. Clinical toxicologists, medical specialists {{in the area of}} poisoning, may be involved in <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> is {{suspected}} based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. Neuroimaging helps in determining the <b>diagnosis</b> and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incident, reports carried {{speculation}} by Cho's {{family members in}} South Korea that he was autistic. However, no known record exists of Cho ever being diagnosed with autism, nor could an autism <b>diagnosis</b> be verified with Cho's parents. The Virginia Tech Review Panel report dismissed an autism <b>diagnosis</b> and experts later doubted the autism claim.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{suspected}} of having DVT may be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test may {{also be used to}} assist with excluding the <b>diagnosis</b> (because of its high sensitivity) or to signal a need for further testing. <b>Diagnosis</b> is most commonly done with ultrasound of the suspected veins.|$|E
5|$|Rapid <b>diagnosis</b> and {{treatment}} {{are important in}} the care of TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>Diagnosis</b> with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> and {{classification}} of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, <b>diagnosis</b> may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> may be {{suspected}} on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the <b>diagnosis,</b> as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> of COPD {{should be}} {{considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. Spirometry is then used to confirm the <b>diagnosis.</b> Screening those without symptoms is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFAâ€”autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid <b>diagnosis</b> from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate <b>diagnosis,</b> was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the <b>diagnosis</b> of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of all of}} these hallmarks is not needed for a <b>diagnosis.</b> A clinical <b>diagnosis</b> is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the <b>diagnosis</b> of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the <b>diagnosis,</b> but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests play an {{important}} role in the <b>diagnosis</b> and treatment of many cardiovascular conditions.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{taxonomy}} of Theriosuchus itself is somewhat convoluted. Many recent taxonomic studies have not provided an explicit set of characteristics that unite species of Theriosuchus and separate them from other atoposaurids; the only such diagnoses {{that have been}} produced were given by Steve Salisbury and Darren Naish in 2011, and Jeremy Martin et al. in 2010. In 2016 Mark Young et al. criticized these diagnoses, noting that many characters were either more widely distributed among the Atoposauridae, difficult to assess, or - {{in the case of}} the latter <b>diagnosis</b> - not present at all. Young et al. provided an alternative <b>diagnosis</b> containing nine traits, mostly involving teeth; however, they also noted that there was variation among the expression of these traits, which calls into question the monophyly of Theriosuchus. K. langenbergensis differs from this <b>diagnosis</b> in four out of nine traits, which Schwarz et al. cited as a basis for both the generic separation of Knoetschkesuchus and the necessity of revising the <b>diagnosis</b> further.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 lack a specific <b>diagnosis</b> code for NSML, the <b>diagnosis</b> code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, {{although it has been}} shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{place of}} first {{complaint}} to a physician is a hospital emergency room. Up to 94% of those suffering from SCSFLS are initially misdiagnosed. Incorrect diagnoses include migraines, meningitis, Chiari malformation and psychiatric disorders. The average time from onset of symptoms until definitive <b>diagnosis</b> is 13 months. A study found a 0% success rate for proper <b>diagnosis</b> {{in the emergency}} department.|$|E
5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay <b>diagnosis.</b> Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options {{and the expansion}} of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD. There are indications AS has been diagnosed more frequently in recent years, partly as a residual <b>diagnosis</b> for children of normal intelligence who are not autistic but have social difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{discovery}} of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical <b>diagnosis</b> based on physical symptoms and a family history of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before <b>diagnosis.</b> These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> {{includes}} epidemiology, early <b>diagnosis,</b> and biomarkers.|$|E
25|$|A {{provisional}} <b>diagnosis</b> of bone spavin should {{usually be}} supported by further investigation in order to confirm the <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ornithine transcarbamylase is only {{expressed}} in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the <b>diagnosis</b> requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, {{this was one of}} the only methods for confirmation of a suspected <b>diagnosis.</b> In cases where prenatal <b>diagnosis</b> was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected. Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred method of <b>diagnosis</b> in asymptomatic family members after the <b>diagnosis</b> has been confirmed in a proband.|$|E
25|$|Deaths: An {{estimated}} 13,712 {{people with}} an AIDS <b>diagnosis</b> died in 2012, and approximately 658,507 people in the United States with an AIDS <b>diagnosis</b> have died overall. The deaths of persons with an AIDS <b>diagnosis</b> can be due to any causeâ€”that is, the death {{may or may not}} be related to AIDS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> is {{made on the}} appearance; {{the virus}} cannot {{routinely}} be cultured. The <b>diagnosis</b> can be confirmed by excisional biopsy.|$|E
25|$|If {{some doubt}} remains {{regarding}} the <b>diagnosis,</b> definitive <b>diagnosis</b> can involve osmotic fragility testing, an autohaemolysis test, and direct protein assaying by gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the <b>diagnosis</b> is made at {{the time}} of birth by {{physical}} examination. Recent advances in prenatal <b>diagnosis</b> have allowed obstetricians to diagnose facial clefts in utero with ultrasonography.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for <b>diagnosis</b> is identification of trypanosomes in a patient sample by microscopic examination. Patient samples {{that can be used}} for <b>diagnosis</b> include chancre fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for <b>diagnosis,</b> but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical <b>diagnosis.</b> Further, seroconversion occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a T. b. rhodesiense infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.|$|E
25|$|CT scans {{are often}} used in the {{evaluation}} of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, and may suggest the <b>diagnosis</b> of ischemic colitis, pick up complications, or suggest an alternate <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|For {{botulism}} in babies, <b>diagnosis</b> {{should be}} made on signs and symptoms. Confirmation of the <b>diagnosis</b> is made by testing of a stool or enema specimen with the mouse bioassay.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{of the hip}} {{may suggest}} and/or verify the <b>diagnosis.</b> X-rays usually {{demonstrate}} a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI {{may be useful in}} making the <b>diagnosis</b> in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed 6 weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early <b>diagnosis.</b> MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97 to 99% against 88 to 93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive <b>diagnosis</b> relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral epiphysis (the developing femoral head).|$|E
